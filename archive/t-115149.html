Hey, we all know that this classical picture of rotating electrons isn't correct. What about a visualization showing the s-, p-, d-orbitals?!<br />
<br />
The electron could move around according to the probability given by the orbital. Loud music (v&gt;0.99) could stimulate an excitation to highr energy levels. When the electron falls down to a lower level a photon should be emitted.<br />
<br />
Hey, with many atoms we could build a laser pulsed by the music.<br />
<br />
That's what I call a challenge!!!<br />

things that need help(!):<br />
<br />
1. sometimes only one of the superscopes shows up when I load the avs. Don't know why...but if I change a variable in the init to 1, then back to 0, it shows up...why??<br />
2. the orbits of the electrons need a bulge at the point where the circle is being drawn to represent the actual electron.(possibly something that reacts to the beat?)<br />
3. should the orbits be more static?<br />
<br />
Perhaps there's an entirely better method...make some changes to this one, or make your own...but let's see it either way!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice, but classical so far.<br />
<br />
back to quantum mechanics: the attached pic shows the first six orbitals (projection) for an H-atom. I'm looking for the formula (probability density).<br />
<br />
If the electron falls back from a higher level to a lower level a photon will be emitted. The color (wavelenght) depends on the energy difference between the two levels.<br />

<br />
... and therefore a little bit boring.<br />
<br />
The ground state is the 1s-orbital. If the music gets loud (|v|&gt;0.35) (or by random) the electron is excited to a 2p-orbital. After a random time (per frame: rand(100)&lt;1) the electron falls down to the ground state. A photon is emitted (okay, just a simple line).<br />
<br />
Next steps:<br />
<br />
- more orbitals<br />
- many moving atoms<br />
- stimulated emission<br />
- photon color according to energy difference<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The thing is that AVS isn't really a simulation environment... its meant to look really cool. I think that the classical atom has far more potential as a visually pleasing preset. Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
The other thing is how to represent an electron (or any particle) accurately since it is (apparently) a particle and a wave (a contradiction no doubt resulting from masses of assumptions and tiny errors... in maths we would accept this as definate proof that something is wrong but physicists are above logic it would seem) so how would you do it? make a particle which looks like a wave shape, which moves along a wavy path or make a particle which simply behaves like a wave? So how can we represent an atom correctly if we can't represent its constiuents correctly?</div></div><hr />

=============================<br />
<br />
Five moving Hydrogen atoms.<br />
<br />
The ground state is the 1s-orbital. <br />
Higher orbitals: 2s 2p 3s 3p 3d (projections to x-y-plane).<br />
<br />
Rnl (=Rn*Fl) and Yml should be correct except for the normalization.<br />
<br />
The state changes with loud music (v&gt;0.4) or by chance 1:1000.<br />
<br />
If the new energy level is lower than the previous one, a photon is emitted (okay, just a simple line).<br />
<br />
3 =&gt; 1 violet<br />
3 =&gt; 2 red<br />
2 =&gt; 1 green<br />
<br />
If you want to see more details of the orbitals, increase n for one SuperScope. Unfortunately it will be less often exicted (dunno why). So decrease the value 0.4 in per frame: ex=bor(above(abs(v),0.4).<br />

Depends on the viewer: For a physician it's entertaining because it IS realistic. Otherwise I wouldn't have done it :) <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can't do a 3d model for the orbitals. (Unfortunately AVS can't do either, because it's so damn slow!)<br />
<br />
Btw for all the major dudes: <br />
----------------------------<br />
For the wishlist (okay, okay, it's a different thread):<br />
<br />
Is it possible to render SMALL bitmaps? E.g.: 80*80 bitmap of an orbital (or leaves :) ) that can move around anmd is only rendered according to its size (I guess EffectList affects the whole screen?).<br />
<br />
Another wish: Most likely AVS interprets the code (like BASIC). Can it be compiled to increase speed?</div></div><hr />

Yours or mine? I doubt that anybody would be entertained by a central sphere and rotating circles. Especially if the movement is not at all related to music!<br />
<br />
The major problem with all the presented atoms is imho that you know everything after - uhmm, let's say 5 seconds!? So what's the point? Even Jaheckelsafar's atom which is quite nice get's boring very soon.<br />
<br />
And, last but not least, I haven't done my atoms for your entertainment, but I wanted to try what can be done with AVS and what cannot. <br />
<br />
Btw: The best preset I've seen so far (okay, it's a short career o ftwo weeks) is Starchase by fck (in aapd3). Very impressive.<br />

Ooops, and I thought I could become a Major Dude just because of programming skills. But then: there is your demand for aesthetics. May I quote from your posting regarding my Trance preset?!<br />

<br />
Fortunately aesthetics is a very subjective sense. I like the Trance preset, you don't. Just fair. But I think resolution and frame rate are quite objective aspects of aesthetecis:<br />
<br />
Nobody can call a resolution of 320*240 aesthetic (imho).<br />
<br />
If in higher resolution the framerate goes down to 3-4 then music and visulaization simply can't fit: E.g. Trance has got 140 bpm. A framerate of 3fps gives 180 fpm. So you have to decide wether to dance according to music or the visualization??? :confused: :weird: :eek: :rolleyes:  <br />
<br />

You are not supposed to solve any of my problems! I just asked questions, that could be also seen as suggestions. So if you know the answer, I would be pleased to know. If the suggestions have already been made, forget it. But I don't think so, because I haven't seen them in UnConed's updated wishlist. So he might consider to add them.<br />

You probably like your own presets because you made them, and you're proud of them.  That doesn't mean anybody else will like them.  I've made a lot of stuff (not just AVS) in my life that I thought was pretty damn kickass, and had everyone tell me it sucks.  That's just how it goes.<br />
<br />
Also, resolution has just about zero to do with aesthetics.  You can look at the Mona Lisa from 40' away or 2&quot;, it's gonna look the same.  Also, have you ever even seen a preset with 3D ANYTHING?  Low framerates simply come with decent 3D in AVS, period.  But 3D is a whole lot more aesthetic than 2D.<br />
<br />
If you're just watching AVS on your computer (and you have your screen set to 800x600 like a sensible person), then 320x240 is just fine.  If you're VJing parties and wanna get paid big bux, then you want really fast twin processors and a lot of RAM so you can get 20-30 FPS at, say, 1152x864 with high-quality DM gridsizes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- removing two effect lists for each electron<br />
- removing misc/buffer save for each electron<br />
- separating electron and its orbit (after and before Set Render Mode)<br />
- removing Trans/Brightness and adjusting Fadeout<br />
<br />
I think it looks quite similar - but it's four times faster now.<br />
<br />
Avoid effect lists if they are not necessary!<br />

<div class="posttext">GJ. Dunno why I didn't see that I could stick everything in the same effect list. Thanks.<br />
<br />
I still like having the fadeout though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now with occlusion behind the nucleus :) (still needs a little work though)<br />
<br />
The reason for the effect lists was so the electons would leave a kind of burn effect.</div></div><hr />
