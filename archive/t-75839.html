      <p class="post-content"><strong>my opinion</strong><br />
      Not bad. I think gr is your best one, and lc is your second best. Though, for lc, I'd recommend moving the moving particles form the second effect list to the third, and getting rid of it (the sceond one). I think you'd need more movement to your visualizations. And I'd suggest not using random colorfade.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like them mj. You are off to a nice start. Not bad use of the random colorfade, but I don't know if it quite works.<br />
      <br />
      Montana, you are being overly harsh again. They are at least as good as the stuff you do. Why do you always try to discourage the newbies?</p>
