		Yeah, I know, you're probably tired of seeing the same theme in my presets especially since they're not amazing quality anyway but this one does look better. This is probably the closest I've come to making a high quality preset so I thought I'd share it with all of you. I like feedback on my presets anyway, it's always good to see some different opinions. I included some mods of my original wormhole preset, the wormhole 2, and one mod of the wormhole 2. I finally got the color to change on beat like I wanted to in my wormhole preset so I thought I'd add that to this pack. Let me know what you think.

		Good thing you tried messing around with the SSC in colormod. You know that pi can be written as $pi nowadays (from wa5.00 and on)? About the DM in the same preset, it does nothing with colors so only r is used in this case.<br />
Also, the buffer saves aren't resetored anywhere. try setting the first one to alternate restore/save (or the other way around) for a (much) beter looking preset.

		Yeah, I forgot they added pi when they updated avs. I'm not sure why I put the color stuff with the DM, I guess that's just a side effect of late night preset making :igor: . You were right about the buffers too. I set the second one to alternate save/restore and it does improve it a little. It's not a drastic change but it seems a bit cleaner towards the center where it used to get slightly fuzzy sometimes. I appreciate the advice :D .
