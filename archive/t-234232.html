<div class="posttext">Oh god! I have just bought an Athlon 64 4000+ and this fucking AVS is so slooooowwww at 800*600 (20 fps) fullscreen.<br />
<br />
It's a shame. Why don't you try to recode it with assembler???? Is coded in Visual Basic maybe?  Ja ja ja ja :P<br />
<br />
Maybe at year 2010 I will be able to run it fullscreen at 1024*768 at 60 FPs...... with an athlon 15.000+ 512Bits and 128 GB RAM</div></div><hr />

Really? Then my AVS should be BLAZING fast, because i've got a really short penis, short distance to travel from the core to the display ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Are you sure you've got an Athlon 64 4000+ and not an Athlon 64 400+? That's an easy mistake to make because they've got so many zeros close to each other, so it's easy to accidentally see an extra one, especially when you cross your eyes.<br />
<br />
Try uncrossing your eyes.<br />
<br />
Also, when was the last time you had your computer exorcised? These days, especially with Windows DS, it's good to have a professional exorcism at least once a month; otherwise the demons build up and your monitor eventually starts spinning around and spewing vomit. A simple firewall won't help you then. You need Microsoft Update (http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/) and holy water.<br />
<br />
Pity the Winter Solstice was about a week ago; that could've helped if you were a virgin and had a large calf that you could sacrifice. Oh well, the next one's less than a year away!<br />
<br />
Oh, and it wouldn't hurt to make sure your video drivers and DirectX are up-to-date, just in case.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute... since when can AVS go up to 800x600?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">but don't say AVS is a fast program because it isn't. Running fullscreen at 1024*768 with a simple processor (not dual) is impossible to achieve good framerate.<br />
<br />
Sorry boy but this is the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JFASI</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th December 2005, 02:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Are you stupid? (Rhetorical question)<br />
AVS is blazingly fast! Unless...<br />
<br />
Let's see... 1024 times 768 is 776192,<br />
<br />
6 Legions of demons times 66 cohorts times 666 members of a cohort is 263736<br />
<br />
That times the unholy trinity, 3, is 791208<br />
<br />
Ratio between that and number of pixels is 1.0193457<br />
<br />
Only two digits that don't appear there are 2, 6, and 8<br />
<br />
Multiply those together and get 96!<br />
<br />
Aha! 96 is the number of dead in hell in billions!!!<br />
<br />
1024x768 is a cursed pixelrate!!! StevenRoy was right! You have too many demons on your system!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">StevenRoy</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th December 2005, 02:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No, 69 is the sign of the yin-yang, meaning balance, and 96 is that backwards, meaning chaos. That's why 1024x768 is evil.<br />
<br />
Or, in other words, AVS is simply not designed to run at such high resolutions, at least not quickly. If you simply must run at 800x600 or bigger (you big macho man you), at least turn on &quot;pixel doubling&quot; so AVS will only have to process 1/4 the number of pixels each frame. You should also make sure you have a 32-bit mode selected, since that's AVS's native pixel format. That should improve your frame rate drastically, and you won't even need to castrate yourself (although I'd still recommend it for compatibility reasons).</div></div><hr />

Realizing that what makes AVS attractive isn't the speed would help very much too.<br />

Jap agree, i have very slow compuer and I still enjoy AVS, making and watching them.<br />

<div class="posttext">err you need a larger cache [e.g. 1mb (L2) ]<br />
this way it will store a lot more data into the processor, and erase it if it's not needed, this is what makes a quick computer, but you also alot more things, and SSE3/4 support would be nice :)</div></div><hr />
