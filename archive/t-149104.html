Lots of fixes for issues described in the last post, and other stuff:<br />
<br />
<br />
  made config change detection a little more accurate<br />
  made superscope/dmove/shift/etc reinit on edit work right (Now variables are cleared on edit, always, but the init code is run too)<br />
  made trans / movement only replace usereval with preseteval if editted<br />
  fixed trans / movement backwards compatible stuff (no crashy at least)<br />
  updated eval documentation stuff, need people to write docs for it, too.. heheh (see the help then send me the docs)<br />
 lots of ui cleanups (more edit room!)<br />
 fixed some fullscreen new fbresize bugs<br />
 updated fullscreen overlay mode some<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, I'd suggest you just use globals sparingly.<br />
<br />
The main reason I have against self definable global variables, is <br />
scope. Once a preset creates a global variable, does that mean it is there forever? Do we have a limited number of globals? How do you handle these things?<br />

<br />
Actually there is already a way to do this.<br />
In your render() function, you can return one of the two values (actually you can just set those bits in the return value):<br />
<br />
#define SET_BEAT		0x10000000<br />
#define CLR_BEAT		0x20000000<br />
<br />
SET_BEAT changes the beat status to &quot;beat&quot;, CLR_BEAT clears it to<br />
&quot;no beat&quot; :)<br />

Is it possible to make the Color modifier work with coords? To make things like &quot;red=if(above(x,0),1,0);&quot; (for example) possible? Shouldn't be to hard, it works in Superscopes, I bet it can work this way as well.<br />
<br />
Hope you can find some time to do this.<br />

Beat detection doesn't seem to work correctly over here with Color Modifier, though I'm not sure yet how to use it correctly. Maybe somebody could post a simple preset which uses color modifier with Beat Detection?<br />

<div class="posttext">i think the new avs version should have some often used dynamic movements in a preset list (similiar to movement). most people here might disagree, but think of the non-techies too! i'm particularly thinking of basic DMs, like rotation, zooms etc.<br />

hello? on what lonely island were you hiding the last year? winamp 2.81 had a serious vulnerability (http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/19/1329243&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=128). and there's no real reason why winamp 2.9 should be any slower (if you have a slow computer, don't install the media library).</div></div><hr />

<br />
the global vars seem to persist after the preset is changed - does that open up the possibility of presets morphing into each other or am i being silly?<br />
<br />
if so, maybe we could decide on standard meanings for them (eg i've got reg00 set to the aspect ratio, or reg2* holds various y rotation things) so that they'd all be 'compatible'?<br />
<br />
ps. I just changed a synched preset over into globals, and jumped from 18 to 26fps! yay!</div></div><hr />

<br />
adasha:<br />
I had the same idea when Justin mentioned it with the first previev, but it seems that if you change the value of any Greg in your preset <br />
that Greg will get cleared on load. <br />
But you can for example do this:<br />
<br />
first preset:<br />
reg00=blabla;<br />
<br />
second preset:<br />
init{ reg01=reg00 }<br />
must not have any reg00=blabla in it.<br />
<br />
That way you catch the value.<br />
Im not comleatly sure that what im saying is true:D but i think it is.<br />
And that is one of the reasons why the idea isnt a good one:).</div></div><hr />

But anyway, is it really that hard to make it compatible? Tho im prolly the only who would need it, i can understand if you don't want to apply such thing because of one user.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yesterday I DL the pre2 version and I checked the SSC UI and a big smile visited my face. Triple hura for all the new UIs. May I ask why is it better if beat and frame blocks are switched?. And Init could be executed on sizechange in all all components IMHO, or even better the 'main' could have an 'on resize' block.<br />
<br />
The SSC bug I was talkin about on the other thread is in fact an overlay bug.For some reason the color chanells don't align right!?  You can see this as ugly stuff on borders between colors. This is a real pain in the ass when I project AVS in clubs, since overlay is the only way to do it and still have the editor open. Im not sure this doesnt only happen on my computer. <br />
I noticed one on the SSC too (if the line goes offscreen on the bottom or right side it doesnt draw the last line of pixels on the bottom or right side).<br />
I attached a preset that shows these two bugs and the text one. <br />
Another very anoying one is the main list not showing everything in correct order all the time.<br />
<br />
And two things that would realy kick ass: <br />
codable linewidth - a realy usefull one IMO<br />
     antialiseing - a major SSC cosmetic fix (now all SSC stuff is either blured beyond recognition or jagged as hell:D + a lot of my presets look ugly :cry: )<br />
<br />
Enough whineing:), 2.7 version kicks lammas balls, Im still trying to contemplate how all the new stuff will effect presets from here on. Looking forward to W5 and the first packs.<br />
<br />
edit&gt; just read a post by unconed in the other thread(dunno how I missed it last time). He sais that overlay thing isnt a bug at all and that it's suposed to be that way :cry:. Just ignore that part then:).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if someone else has already done a translation of the previous versions, so it may be a stupid request ...<br />
<br />
In order to make the translations easier, is it possible to have all the strings (specially the new helps) at the same place (in the resource would be the best) rather than dispatched in the (binary) code ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a nice job ...<br />
<br />
Congratulations !</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You cannot get it to work with Winamp 3. Winamp 3 does not use vis_avs.dll but a .wac file. You have to download winamp 2 or 5 to run AVS 2.7.</div></div><hr />
