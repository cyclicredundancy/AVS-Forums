      It's...a proto-type at the moment. Comments and suggestions is a most. But only give constructive and intelligent ones, please...If you do not abide by that then I will ignore your comments/suggestions entirely as if they were a mere nuissance. Thank you. Enjoy...</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can remove the convo and the movements and it still looks the same. other than that, pretty simple preset. doesn't seem to be too intentional.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea. Got any ideas of what else to put on it? Like do you have any suggestions of making something that it's moving through? Sort of like a tunnel sort of deal. I'm not sure how I can explain it any better.<br />
      <br />
      Also I do like the X. Simple, but that was intentional. I had made one of the superscopes -1 in order to slant it in the other direction.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Suggestion</strong><br />
      DX consider this an intelligent suggestion, i should warn you that not many people take kindly to avsers that inform others not what to comment on or not once you post it here expect the full front of your wishes on suggestions. you are acting like me when i was first starting out. i may not have as much senority like you but my word is to accept all criticisim as it comes. no offense but</p>

      </blockquote>thats what i call rejecting someones opinion over your own. and Yathosho i completely agree on your suggestion convo and the movements are just wasting fps.

      <p class="post-content">By the way, isn't this DM one of UnconeD's tunnels? Better add his contact information:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        (If you wish to use this preset partially or whole in your own presets or packs, you may do so provided that a clear credit message is included in your preset, along with my contact information.)
      </blockquote>Some change in colors would be good.<br />
      Also, either change your render so that the walls of the tunnel are filled, or change the DM because it really does not come out right with only two lines.<br />
      <br />
      Keep it up!
