      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS has been made open source!</strong><br />
      A sourceforge project is in the process of being created.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to be added to this as a developer (when sf approves the it) please post here with your sourceforge username.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not going to take an active role in this project, I've just been pursuaded by Cody to start it up. Heh.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to start tinkering now, the homepage is here: <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/" target="_blank">http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/</a><br />
      <br />
      However, please hold off on making any (big/important) changes until we have some kind of sourceforge-based source control going.<br />
      <br />
      Lots of love,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">*jawdrops* whoa. I cant believe this finally happened. Although i'm not so good with programming, i can imagine the possibilities of an Open Source AVS. Hopefully someone from the many talented programmers here would make the one wish we've always been waiting for, Make AVS faster...maybe with hardware acceleration.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i guess we'll have to wait for that a bit longer.<br />
      But including some common ape's into AVS itslef seems much more likely to me.<br />
      <br />
      But whatever you want to happen first, my main/only wish would be, that avs stays 'straight'. It'd be awfully bad if we had thousands of different crappy versions. So perhaps/hopefully/PLEASE new winamp-releases could contain the last (finished) open-source-AVS??<br />

      <p class="post-content">huge news. but, just as we've been patiently waiting for avs to become open source, we should be just as patient when it comes to its development. i'm no expert, but i'm pretty sure adding hardware acceleration support is a pretty complicated process, so let's remember codemonkeys are human, and cut em some slack ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">:winamp: Please excuse my ignorance, but what exactly does open source mean? I can surmise from this thread that it means great things are in store for AVS and that changes can be made to the structure, but how does it work? Under whose/what direction will it be, and will changes be possible to the original source files, or will it just be additions to the existing structure? Thanks for any info you can give me.:up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">*Has Googled open source* Oh wow! That is great news indeed. Rovastar, I can see where 'open source' and 'free' wouldn't necessarily be the same in regards to software, but isn't the 'spirit' of open source to make it easily accessible in most ways (including in monetary terms) to all users?</p>

      Wow.. I spend a month or two away from the community after several years of active participation, and lo and behold, they make it open source. Looks like i'll have to start spending more time on irc again too ;]<br />

      It also seems like the community has been growing while i have been gone, so hopefully we will have a few extra coders on board.<br />

      <p class="post-content">A program is created, or written,coded, in a certain language that can be converted to a language the computer understands.<br />
      <br />
      AVS is mainly written in the language C++. Once finished, the computer does not know what to do with it so it has to be converted first (compiled) so the computer understands.<br />
      Like translating english to japanese.<br />
      <br />
      The written text is called the sourcecode. A normal program (.exe) does only have the compiled information. That's useless for a programmer.<br />
      <font size="1">(yes, there are tools to calculate it back a bit but that's always horribly messy and noone likes to go there unless their lives depend on it)</font><br />
      <br />
      A programmer needs the information the original programmer wrote. That information's called the sourcecode.<br />
      <font size="1">To see the sourcecode that created this webpage for example, click on [view]&gt;[source] in your browser.</font><br />
      <br />
      If the original information is not available, then it's called <u>closed source</u>.<br />
      If the original information is available, then it's called <u>open source</u>.<br />
      <br />
      simple as that :p<br />
      <br />
      Another example: AVS visualizations are open-source; you can edit them in the editor window.<br />
      WMP visualizations are closed-source. You cannot edit them. (AFAIK)<br />

      Any movement on actually recompiling AVS with the some of the newer practical APEs included in the dll? I've had a go fiddling with some of the interface, most of which break the module I'm in. Oh well. It would be nice to integrate the AVStrans ape into the main render list options.<br />

      I could say maybe in moth or two there is something ready. It's taking so long because libvisual need some more schizzle on its own (audio rewrite, complete windows port, script... which is supposedly almost ready).<br />

      </blockquote>is down to people wanting to work on it (despite the obvious lack of the code in cvs but nothing stopping people working on the code as is _but_ from what i've seen it's been out for a while now and i've not seen any custom builds (makes you wonder where all the people wanting it open sourced have gone.. such a great system apart from a lack of people).<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm pretty sure that like half of the people that wanted avs open sourced weren't the coders of the community, including me, it was just something we saw as the only light in the future of avs. now it's up to the people who know about the programming side, but then again most of us have a life to, well, live.<br />
      <br />
      i chose to be patient. i never saw open source avs coming, and it happened. i don't see development coming anytime soon, so i'm expecting a surprise :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I gotta agree with carmatic and jaak and say that winamp is the most major thing keeping me with windows. I'd much rather linux, but would miss winamp and visualisations. I'm sure there are other vis' for linux (libvisual?) but if avs and winamp existed for linux it'd be the shizzy yo. Of course, I'm a noob in the world of html, let alone c++ lol. If i ever learn though, I'd be helping! I know its an unreasonable request and codemonkeys are indeed only human, but hardware acceleration would be awesome. I have a sweet graphics card that doesn't get used cuz i'm not a gamer. Too bad.

      <p class="post-content">Looks like this thread is about where it was when i last checked (a while ago now).<br />
      <br />
      I have a lot of time on my hands now, so I'm going run through the code and start commenting it and making it more accessable to all those out there that want to do something (and also so I can get my head around it).<br />
      <br />
      I think if we managed to get it working as its own application, and ported to linux, it could take off. I say that because linux, with all its driver issues, can't get enough of software rendering apps. So it's a match made in heaven really :)<br />
      <br />
      At the moment it uses some assembler features and other things that are dependent on the MS VC++ compiler, and at a quick glance, there seem to be winamp SDK stuff used all the way through it, so it cleaning it out could mean a lot of work.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, if anyone else has some immediate ideas, or has already started playing with it, please post here and let us know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">its great that avs is open source but you can't just magically expect some myserious strangers to start hacking up code and creating what you have allways dreamed of. in its current form its pritty unworkable, tied into too many systems.<br />
      <br />
      if someone were to work on the systems involved and make it into some nice clean code that you could, for example easly modify to work with something like XMMS on linux, im sure that then, the prospect of working on something, not just to port it to diffirent systems. but also to improve avs would be much more attractive.<br />

      You are right that evallib will be a problem, and not just for architecture; it will take a lot of messing around for it to even compile on anything but msvc++ (which i don't have access to).</p>

      <p class="post-content">yea i wish my pack was a bomb mr tomylobo, fireworks night is coming up and iv totally forgot ;) .. gotta have something to explode, im thinkin really shaking up a beer can and creative use of a torch might fool at least someone...<br />
      <br />
      the xmms project peoples are kinda weird though.. i meen, they are kinda some people who made a program for windows 3.1 but refused to update it to windows 9x or something. they won't even update to GTK2, so the menus n stuff look awful for lots. the BMPx peoples seem nice though.. once they have some stable code anyway.<br />
      <br />
      i think maybe the evalib design needs to be rethought.. when you make code thats designed to be portable its usually simple and eligant.. and therefor, reasonably fast. when you make things to work on windows they are generally hacked up to bits to make it fit with the Win32 api.<br />
      <br />
      if someone got it too compile on systems other than windows and vc++ id love to take a shot and hacking some stuff, right now the only copy of vc++ i have is way old.. and not quite.. legal. so i do all my coding with eclipse, gcc, make and the like on linux. plus, vc++ isn't very good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i was thinking about setting something like that up but there are some problems, such as making a cross platform program that needs to be very very very quick.. but doesn't use assembly, using say mmx instructions for x86 processors and using c routines for ppc and the like isn't a good idea because it makes the ppc ports practically useless.<br />
