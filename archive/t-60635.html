<div class="posttext">I've configured my old computer to be an MP3 jukebox (using Winamp of course!)<br />
<br />
I've always enjoyed computer- generated visuals (read: long recreational drug history), so of course I'm running AVS all the time on that machine.  While I think there are some slightly prettier plug-ins for Winamp, AVS's beat prediction (instead of being merely beat-reactive) makes it my first choice for eye-candy.<br />
<br />
ANYWAY, I just did a count on just how many avs files I have installed.  How many do I have?<br />
<br />
Ready?<br />
<br />
4,133!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have suggestions for AVS management?  One thing I would like is a key-press ability to delete the currently displayed preset.  No offense to authors out there, but with so many presets, I'd like to prune the less-than-stellar displays I see.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas about how I might be able to do this, or other suggestions, let me know.<br />
<br />
And - Thanks to all those AVS artists out there churning out displays.  You're truly pioneers in what I consider a new art form.<br />
<br />
best Regards,<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey, AVS-guys outthere!<br />
<br />
I feel so bad... because I have only 250 Presets(including mine) installed ;) <br />
<br />
But not only 5 stars Presets - I have picked those, which looked in my eyes best and exciting!<br />
Thats real work to search for the coolest presets in this never ending number of AVS-Packs!!<br />
<br />
Bye, your Bekay :)</div></div><hr />

You mention AVS crashes with too many presets installed?  There have been times when winamp has crashed unexpectedly, I'm wondering if my bloated collection of presets is the cause.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me more about this?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

What more I can said :). Imagin you have many AVS in your AVS folder and you try to load one of them with right clik over AVS window. Then WINAMP start to read from HDD to memory all AVS (may be only names) and this get 100% of CPU resoureces and then my PC totaly crash (it stop to work).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">10,000???!!!<br />
<br />
Tonic, you are mad, buddy!! ;-D<br />
i know that much of these are yours (includin projects),<br />
but what about others?<br />
do you really think that there's so many good presets?<br />
i mean worth keepin?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Most certainly, out of my own measly collection of 4,000, there are some that come up I'd perfer to remove from my collection.  Question is, short of going through one by one and removing them, there's not an easy way to delete them.  I don't review each preset (or collection) I download.  Usually I pick those that the staff have rated highly and 'click' -- installing them on my mp3 server (in the other room).  <br />
<br />
I guess its just the drawback of quantity over quality.<br />
