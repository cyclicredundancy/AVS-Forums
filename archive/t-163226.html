<div class="posttext">I downloaded WA5 about two weeks ago, and have had trouble with AVS ever since.  I have v2.8, but none of the interactive presets are interactive.  Furthermore, the Texet II APE (which I have) is displayed as an &quot;Unkown Render Object&quot;.  Someone please help!<br />
<br />
I'll be frequenting here, so don't suppose this is just a onetime post type thing. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing you might want to consider is reinstalling Winamp5, but it shouldn't really matter.</div></div><hr />

Yep, thats me.  I just reinstalled it and that didn't help the problem...but it didn't make it worse either...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well uh...you could start with getting all the apes that are required...they have their name in the &quot;unknown render object&quot; dialogue, then you could search for them on the forums...or just reinstall the packs that required them.  most of the apes are probably unconed's apes, which are available at unconed.deviantart.com or at www.acko.net, and a couple of them might be cfp's convolution or video/multi-delay apes, which are available on the forum.  there's also a &quot;complete ape list&quot; thread somewhere around the wishlist forum (i think).  make sure you get all the latest versions of the apes too, as the old colormap/picture II apes are buggy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am AVS literate!!!  I make my own presets, but I don't release them. Jeez...<br />
<br />
I have all the APEs.  It seems as AVS isn't reading them, or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
I installed WA5 again using the method on the forum, but now it isn't showing SSCs or DMs. *freaks out and dies*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">texer2 definitely comes with Winamp5. If you're not getting SSC's or DM's something is definitely wrong with your setup, not the APEs. SSC/DM are builtin components.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm....SSCs and DMs are working again, but still no Texet II.  I am getting angry.  I still haven't done anything interactive yet.  Grrrrr....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">okay, the only reason i can think of that your avs isn't reading the apes is because you're running winamp5 and all your apes are in your winamp2 avs directory.  if you're absolutely sure this isn't the case then something has gone horribly wrong.  in other words, you're sol.  sux2buroflkthxbbq</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm...I downloaded it (for the 10th time) and installed it one more time.  This time all my skins were gone, and AVS presets also.  But, now APE's work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help anyways. ;)</div></div><hr />
