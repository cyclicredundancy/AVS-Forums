      Starting on my coding tutorial. Right now I don't have Winamp with me so I've been working on a definition of syntax - I've gotten this so far, so I thought I'd post it and see what you thought. I figure I'll post everything in tiny bits as time goes on.<br />
      <br />
      BTW there will be a Part I v2 now that AVS2.8 is out, but that'll come after the coding tutorial ;)<br />
      <br />
      If you think I've got my terms wrong feel free to correct me. If you think I'm a total fucking moron feel free to flame me; that's when I know I need to fix something. In any case, thanks for reading this. In part 1 I never got enough proofreading and so I looked back at it recently and realized it's still pretty shit, so I'm gonna make sure this one *isn't* by the time I release it. Since I realize how fkkng nice you're going to be after I've been an asswank to you for so long I'm sure I'll get a good response ;)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      p.s. i'm not sure whether this'll upload right or not, but i'm gonna try anyway. i'm gonna go to bed when this uploads cos i'm fucking tired, so my apologies if it went fuckery.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well explained. Maybe too well, even the dumbes idiot you could think of will be able to understand it. Ok, that's your aim... ;)<br />
      <br />
      What's bad about this?<br />
      <br />
      IMO, you might scare away n00bs with common knowledge (the majority of em) by making them read a fucking huge ammount of text.<br />
      <br />
      Its loooooooooots of reading to get so little information out of it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I thought that might've ended up a little to...verbose. But in my experience, people are <b>really fucking stupid</b> and a lot of them need all that text before they can figure shit out. Then again a lot of people are also already familiar with assignment vs. equations, and won't even bother reading all that crap.<br />
      <br />
      Anubis, what's wrong with it? I can read it just fine, is Windows not reading it as having newlines?</p>

      <p class="post-content">No it isn't. At every spot where an enter should be is a square symbol. So it's entirely without line-breaks. Kinda hard to read then, isn't it ;).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't even have the square symbols. I just got one big paragraph that fits on half of my monitor(1600x1200 resolution). Pain in the ass to read, but from what I glanced at it looks like you explained stuff nicely.</p>

      fragmer: what's with those non-breaking spaces in front of every paragraph (and why use a &lt;div&gt; instead of a &lt;p&gt;? Indenting the first line on a paragraph is not a standard for electronic documents.<br />
      But if you're gonna do it anyway, do it good :P<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I know that, but would it work with MSIE 3.5? or Netscape 3? (muahaha);)<br />
      <br />
      Why &lt;div&gt;? I don't know, just got used to floating positioning stuff :p<br />
      <br />
      Well, I don't think true AVSers use Netscape 3, so I replaced nbsp's, and also some typos, oops :)</p>

      this is NOT A FINAL VERSION, i'm not even close to thinking about making this into html. lemme make this clear to all you people who want to "do me a favor" and make my shit into html documents, cos i'm fucking tired of it: if anyone's going to be doing the html-ing it's gonna be <b>ME</b>. if i wanted your artistic help i'd have asked for it okay? i mean ffs, you don't go around optimizing people's packs and making installers for them, do you? what in the hell makes turning my tutorials into html any different?<br />
      sorry, but i've gotten at least 4 offers so far, and it really pisses me off. all i see in those kinds of requests is 1) someone who just started doing "web design" and is asking everyone he knows if he can do their website for them and 2) someone calling me too fucking stupid to do it on my own. i appreciate you wanting to help, but i really don't appreciate the implications you make when you do so.<br />
      <br />
      well i've said my peace...again i'm sorry, just don't be a dork k?</p>
