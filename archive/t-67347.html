      <p class="post-content">That doesn't really help.<br />
      <br />
      Send me the files (put them in a zip file and post them here), and I'll make a nice sexy installer with a splash screen and everything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No problem. I will get to work on the Mad Masda installer. If it's OK, I'll make a couple images (thumbnail and full image) for it by taking some screenshots. No offense, but the ones in the zip file are a little weird-looking. I'll let you decide for yourself which one you want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a splash screen I just put together. It will display itself in the middle of the screen for a few seconds when the installer is run, it will disappear, and a window will pop up asking the user if they are sure they want to install it. I used a screenshot from "Spooky Square" to make it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh yeah and I need to know if you have any kind of "readme" file that I should include. Don't make me do this over. Writing .nsi files isn't easy. Especially with all the files you have in there. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, if you want the readme in there, just let me know. I'll put it right into the installer, and it will ask the user if he or she wants to view it once the installation is done.<br />

      If you want it in the installer, post it here.</p>
