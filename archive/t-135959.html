<div class="posttext">It's kind of like at my local supermarket... they have this self-scanning system where customers with a card can pick up a handscanner when they come in, scan all the barcodes while they do their shopping and then don't have to unload/reload their cart at the cash-register (for anti-fraud, people get picked out randomly by the computer to still have their cart rescanned).<br />
Two cash registers have a big sign above them saying &quot;Self-scanning ONLY!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Virtually every time I'm there, I hear an attendant saying &quot;Sorry, this cash-register is for self-scanning only *points at sign*. Please use another one.&quot; Reminds me of this forum every time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now i'm not flaming here, but i am so sick of this little crybaby attitude that needs everything to be sent to them in a nice easy package where they don't have to do anything. Why don't you use your head and look around the forums, theres threads everywhere with APEs written on them, there's a search feature. Do something on your own for a change. Whenever i'm learning something new or looking, lets say searching for something i use that big button right in front of your face that says search on it. Is it really that difficult for you to do that. This doesn't usually bother me but i'm an a mood and this thread got in my way. In future, use that brain of yours and stop whinging for everything to be fed to you from everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is to announce that I am leaving. <br />
Yes, Im leaving. why?:eek: because. because 97 percent of you are fucking (there I spelled that out) assholes who waste there life rotting out their eyeballs in front of a computer screen because the only substance they have is a virtual self to help them forget that they're really a fat ass loser that hasnt got off his ass in years and doesnt have any real friends.<br />
And for those of you who think im a sniveling, whining newbie who doesnt know shit about avs, you might be right but i'll still be better person because I'm not the one acting like the coolest person in the world just because i can program computers and i have a virtual reputation. <br />
:hang: :hang: :hang: :hang: :hang: :hang: <br />
tell me, what do you fuckers think of that? guess what? i dont give a shit:hang: :hang:<br />
<br />
ps. DIE ASSHOLES!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
