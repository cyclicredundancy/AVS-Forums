      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Well nothing you do is regular (read: suck up, kiss ass) :p<br />
      Even when you try to do "regular" things it isn't regular :D<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Well i suspected that, but i didn't dare to guess it. (read: didn't want to look stupid if i got it all wrong ;) )<br />
      <br />
      Well the "ugly edges" are covered really nice (the alpha blend fog is sound resposive?) I guess it has something to do with your texer ape.

      <p class="post-content">It's part of a mix that was playing when I was working on the preset. I recorded it off Radio FG, which you can listen to via Shoutcast (it's a 'real' radio, not just MP3). They broadcast cool progressive house mixes during the week from 20h to midnight.</p>
