<div class="posttext">I've been working on a preset recently and i've wanted to use if statements such as:<br />
<br />
ws=getspec(0,1,0); if(ws&gt;3){ws=3;}<br />
<br />
but of couse this syntax and form isn't supported by AVS.  So really, my question is: is it possible to do something if a number is greater then a differnt number in AVS?  The if statement that they have so far i've only been able to get to work for 0 or non-0... like it says it does..:( <br />
<br />
<br />
oh and if your interested here's the preset i want to add it to, it's kinda cool in my opnion.<br />
<br />
<br />
(edit)<br />
<br />
ooo  i think i figured it out!<br />
d=i*0.98*max(min(getspec(0,1,0),.2),.05)*5;<br />
vwahahaha I'm so smart :p <br />
:)     :) <br />
no thanks to all you suckers!  (just kidding :p {but what gives i mean you had almost an hour to respond! :p})</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just look it up in expression help.  It's really not that hard.  The structure is if(condition,true,false), and &gt; is replaced by the 'above' function (x&gt;y::above(x,y)) so:<br />
v1=getspec(0,1,0); ws=if(above(v1,3),3,v1);</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks, i didn't see how the above worked into it all.<br />
<br />
Anyways it would be nice in nullsoft would implement the 'standard' kind of if statement...  I'm sure more people are used to working with that form...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The AVS-language doesn't have any form of flow control, so the if-pseudofunction is only a simple 'hack'. Works nicely though once you get used to it.<br />
<br />
And of course, flow-control and all the other whistles and bells is already on the wishlist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Serenyddion:  I know you said you were kidding when you said, &quot;no thanks to all you suckers! (just kidding  {but what gives i mean you had almost an hour to respond! })&quot;<br />
<br />
And the people in the forums are generally very friendly.  I (as you may have noticed) was signed in at the time you made your post.  I immediately looked at it-and I would have gladly written a reply responding to your question-but I didn't *know* the answer for sure.<br />
<br />
The Winamp AVS forum is meant to be more like a bunch of helpful (but sometimes busy) people who enjoy answering other people's questions in their spare time.  But keep in mind that the forums aren't like a 24-hour technical support line - because what makes the forums so great is that the the everything the members do is on their own free time; so whenever the members are booked up either because of school, a job, or whatever, it may seem to take a long time before your question gets answered.<br />
<br />
And considering that many members like me might not know the answer, I'd say getting an answer within a day is a very quick response.<br />
<br />
Take for example, my post called &quot;Sneak peek at AVS pack!!!!&quot;  Here's a hyperlink-but I'm not sure it will work...<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661  <br />
There's a lot of presets in my preview to my AVS pack, so I anticipate that it will take a while before I get a reply back-because there's so many presets to look through &amp; analyze completely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But since you were just kidding, I was just answering your question 'what gives' that you didn't get an immediate reply.<br />
<br />
So I guess it's all in good fun :)<br />

<div class="posttext">The c++ statements:<br />
if(x)<br />
{<br />
   y<br />
}<br />
else<br />
{<br />
   z<br />
}<br />
translate into the AVS language as:<br />
if(x,y,z)<br />
The normal &gt; and &lt; operators are equivalent to the above and below functions, respectively.  So a&gt;b = above(a,b); and a&lt;b = below(a,b)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just said that because i figured that an hour WAS a far too short time for a post to get any responces, which seems to hold true here, and does for most of the other forums i visit...<br />
<br />
so the what gives was a joke as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">By the way Atero, you got a detail wrong:<br />
<br />
In the C++ code<br />
if (x) { y } else { z }<br />
<br />
y and z can be multiple statements, in AVS, they have to return a value.<br />
<br />
So in fact, AVS's a=if(x,y,z) is exactly the same as using the ternary operator a = (x ? y : z). Though most people don't even know it exists.</div></div><hr />
