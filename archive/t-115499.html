      <p class="post-content"><strong>improved Trance preset (incl. documentation for e.g. nested loops)</strong><br />
      Trance, Goa, Shakra, Charras, Sun and Moon<br />
      ===========================================<br />
      <br />
      This preset is quite fast: 10 fps with 640*480 with 1 Ghz. The background looks rather pixelized with lower resolutions.<br />
      <br />
      The background is based on three hand-made Simple renderings using the wafeform. Therefore, it's quite hectic and should be used with Trance music.<br />
      <br />
      The Dynamove shows a long cycle time of 8+ minutes depending on the beat.<br />
      <br />
      Three randomly flying objects (leaves, sun, moon) give the impression to be at a Trance party in Goa. Feel free to copy them if you don't like the background.<br />

      PS: Hopefully I'm not breaking the rules by reposting an improved preset. :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">As far as I know, you aren't breaking any, as long as you are the creator of the original. If not, you have to give credit.<br />
      <br />
      The beach one was kinda nice (if repetative), still didn't like trance too much though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There aren't any rules aside from ripping and general netiquette... but the more presets the better. However, if this is a repost of an earlier preset, you could just resurrect the old thread by replying there. This keeps the forum coherent and easy to search through later on.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just because it's hectic doesn't mean it has to go with trance, and just because you want a trance preset doesn't mean you have to make it hectic. We're going for aesthetics here, and (no offense) that's not what you have in your trance preset. Frankly I liked the original better, but it too could've improved a lot.<br />
      The beach one is interesting, but not that responsive in the long run.<br />
      You seem to have some skill, I suggest you keep working on it; eventually you might get an 'I'm an AVSer!' sticker and a swatch watch for your work.</p>
