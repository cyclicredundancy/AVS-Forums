===========================================<br />
<br />
This preset is quite fast: 10 fps with 640*480 with 1 Ghz. The background looks rather pixelized with lower resolutions.<br />
<br />
The background is based on three hand-made Simple renderings using the wafeform. Therefore, it's quite hectic and should be used with Trance music.<br />
<br />
The Dynamove shows a long cycle time of 8+ minutes depending on the beat.<br />
<br />
Three randomly flying objects (leaves, sun, moon) give the impression to be at a Trance party in Goa. Feel free to copy them if you don't like the background.<br />

PS: Hopefully I'm not breaking the rules by reposting an improved preset. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">As far as I know, you aren't breaking any, as long as you are the creator of the original. If not, you have to give credit.<br />
<br />
The beach one was kinda nice (if repetative), still didn't like trance too much though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There aren't any rules aside from ripping and general netiquette... but the more presets the better. However, if this is a repost of an earlier preset, you could just resurrect the old thread by replying there. This keeps the forum coherent and easy to search through later on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just because it's hectic doesn't mean it has to go with trance, and just because you want a trance preset doesn't mean you have to make it hectic.  We're going for aesthetics here, and (no offense) that's not what you have in your trance preset.  Frankly I liked the original better, but it too could've improved a lot.<br />
The beach one is interesting, but not that responsive in the long run.<br />
You seem to have some skill, I suggest you keep working on it; eventually you might get an 'I'm an AVSer!' sticker and a swatch watch for your work.</div></div><hr />
