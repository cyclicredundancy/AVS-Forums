<div class="posttext">Does anyone know why the max fps for AVS is usualy 64 fps, but every now-and-then it gets higher? (I am currently looking at duo's 'fall from grace' preset at 215 fps!)  The only thing I've noticed is that this sometimes happens when other programs are also open (not sure which ones)... :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Chances are your computer is rounding the FPS rate off at powers of 2(32, 64, 128), so it will just keep it at 64 if it's within a certain range of 64.  If it gets out of that range then it just uses the &quot;actual&quot; framerate.  <br />
<br />
215FPS?!?  What kind of computer do you have and what resolution are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Wiser87</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 01:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well... it's not full screen, and the resolution is 256x169.  I'm not so sure about the rounding thing because it sometimes does this with presets that are normally around 50-70 fps.  Also, the 'fall from grace' preset would also be limited to 64 fps at times.<br />

My computer is a P4 2.4GHz with 512MB ram.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ARe you sure it isn't 21.5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Wiser87</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 03:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Very sure.  Actually, it was more like 215.5 fps.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Wee!  I'm a senior member now! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It must be a fluke...I have a 2.1 GHzand it barely breaks 60 with a blank preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Change your 'wait for retrace' setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh yeah... forgot to mention that I have 'wait for retrace' disabled.<br />
Also, I was getting fps's in the high 100's for some other presets as well...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Leave &quot;wait for retrace&quot; disabled.  It is not necessary.  I forgot to disable it because I just did a clean install of my computer.  Even with pixel doubling, I still don't get much more speed (it snaps at 64, so it is hard to tell)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The odd thing is that it sometimes happens ONLY when other programs are open.  One time, the FPS's jumped when I had an installer program open, and returned to 'normal' as soon as I closed it... :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then it almost certainly is a bug, it shouldn't speed up when other programs are using the processor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Happens to me, too. Try opening Kazaa and clicking the Theater tab. For me, this fixes the problem until I exit Kazaa.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">isn't this already discussed in the troubleshooting forums?</div></div><hr />
