		some good and interesting ideas for noob presets, some arent bad but some are plain old crap, disgusting gas for example, simple + blue + scatter. There are some nice looking things in there though. I would strongly advise against using APEs such as tentacles and metaballs 3d. Try messing with different scopes and movements and look at the avs primer. These are very noob and typical and make too much use of those APEs. decent noob presets, lose the flashy or grainy or bright colours with loads of white type presets and those that rely on the APEs you have some good ideas, work on some original ideas and learn more about AVS and you'll get better.

		Dizzy spraypaint is the only one I even remotely like in this pack.  Almost all(or maybe even all) of your presets are just using the basic predefined objects, someone else's code, and/or apparently random coding.  Like raz said, try to figure out what you can do with AVS in the primer or on these forums.  These presets have basically all been done before and yours aren't anything special.  I'm not going to go in depth with a review for each preset, because I would be saying the same thing over and over again - Don't use moving particles like that(this is seen way too often); learn to code; try at least modifying the SSC's and DM's; Don't ever use the rotating stars IMO; Don't make multiple presets that are all based on the same things - pick one out of the group; Don't use the tentacles and metaballs that much.  Overall - 2.0/5.0

		One more thing to point out....<br />
<br />
In the preset &quot;hell&quot;, you used UnConeD's picture that he used in the preset &quot;Second Reality&quot;.  If you are going to do that, you should contact the person and give them credit in your comment.  Actually, you probably shouldn't even use the same picture, because it's like using the metaballs and tentacle .ape files, they were both only meant for one preset.  Otherwise, I'd rate this pack about a 2.5, try figuring out the math effects, because those are gold.

		Welcome Pixelcraft; Welcome unripeLemon...haven't been in the forums for a little while :)<br />
<br />
Well, I must agree with what anubis, raz, &amp; pixelcraft said about not using tentacles, moving particles, etc. so much, but you do obviously have a good deal of potential in terms of superscopes.<br />
<br />
I think that for a noob pack, it's not that bad, but it's not that great---mainly because it has a lot of &quot;junk&quot; (excuse the term, please...it's nothing personal).  For example, say that someone posts 25 presets, and all but 5 are crap.  The 5 that aren't might have been halfway decent with a few suggestions from the forums, but because of the 20 bad ones, we just tend to put a general label on your pack of &quot;mostly crap, but obvious potential if developed.&quot;  Because of this, we don't tend to analyze the better ones so much.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't get discouraged, because I must admit that I could learn a lesson or two from a couple of your presets' superscopes.  Just remember that more of your own work (in terms of SSC &amp; DM) makes for a much better pack than presets loaded with pre-made effects.  Don't get me wrong---it's okay to use some pre-made effects in controlled moderation.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of something I made a while back when a forum member suggested that I try not using the fireworks APE preset so much &amp; see what sort of cool effects I can create without it.  It still uses moving particles (pre-made effect), but because of the awesome smokey effect I created with carefully planned water bumps, it didn't have that reaction &quot;Oh, no!  Not another one!&quot;---it's pretty cool.  Make some goals for yourself---and don't be discouraged if you can't figure out how to make the effect you have in mind for a whlie.  That's normal :)<br />
<br />
Remember when you look at other people's work, you're looking at lots of time spent polishing and working at our AVS skills, and think of the fact that other AVS artists are a lot better than you not that you're bad---just that it shows what lots of time spent on AVS can do for you.  It's an opportunity to improve.<br />
<br />
Best wishes at AVSing!  :)<br />

		A few hints.<br />
<br />
If you use code from somebody else, ask them or at least give credit or any packs you post will get yanked.<br />
<br />
If you use any pictures or AVI files, include them. AVS won't go to your computer any download the files for us. :p<br />
<br />
Movement Zohar is a newpicks preset you just changed the words on and added a star field to. You have to try harder than that. :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, the rest was newbie stuff. Everybody here went through the newbie stage at some point. Keep it up though. Practice makes perfect.<br />
<br />
&lt;goes back ro practicing&gt;

		Most of these were in the other pack, and I still don't like them.  What isn't predefined seems to be randomly coded, which is better than all predefined, but doesn't yield the greatest results IMO.

		I must agree with anubis that a lot of the ones that I personally don't think should go in your pack, whenever you started thinking about putting it on Winamp or Deviantart.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest problems with always using APEs like Tentacles &amp; Metaballs is that they really slow down your presets.  There just isn't enough originality in presets with only pre-made effects or stuff you copied off other people without their permission &lt;this is starting to become a MAJOR nag topic, here...hint hint!!!&gt;<br />
<br />
The *better* presets in the pack (not necessarily the ones that I would limit the pack you actually would submit to Winamp) are ones where you experiment with superscopes &amp; movements...like in curlyscope.  A comment I wanted to make about something that I noticed about evil thing.  Evil thing wouldn't be a half-bad preset if the effect of the superscopes wasn't ruined by the blur and other distortions that would cover them up.  Try moving the superscopes DOWN in the list of effects, so it would be below the blur and mirror.  Then select one of the superscopes, and for the option &quot;Dot/Line,&quot; try clicking Line and see what shows up.  It isn't half bad coding when it isn't ruined and hidden by the sort of stuff that &lt;REALLY BUGS US&gt;.  If you made this ON YOUR OWN, I'd like to congratulate you.  Because it's far more advanced than I started out at (and somewhat...still am), I was wondering whether you borrowed the code from another preset, changed it a little, and then used it.  I won't list any more right now, but I remember seeing a few other good presets with nice superscopes---it just takes too long looking through everything to find the good stuff! :)<br />
<br />
Also, although I don't like the movement at all in dizzy river---it's a start toward getting into making your own code.<br />
<br />
Into the void was actually halfway decent in terms of appearance and the fact that it produced a decent effect (intentional or unintentional...I still found it a good deal more than decent).  Sometimes using superscopes &amp; DMs isn't the only way to make a cool, original preset.  You know my avatar?  It's a highly-compressed, very distored version of a preset I made a while back to imitate Sauron's eye from Lord of the Rings.  Although the key part wasn't a superscope (it had a few...and I had some help with getting them the way I wanted them), the main effect was plain and simple tinkering with it and trial-and-error at trying to produce the desired effect by what I could do in AVS at that time.  The superscope I had help with was just to make it a little bit more convincing, but the general effect I created on my own with various starfields, slight fuzzify, movements, blurs, etc.  That would be the best way to establish yourslf<br />
<br />
&lt;POINTS AGAIN TO THE ZIPPED FILE I SUBMITTED EARLIER called DRUNKEN SMOKING FLARES.  take the hint&gt;  That's what I'd recommend starting out doing for a while to get a feel for the type of stuff you can do in AVS without really diggind into superscopes and DMs right away.  Just see what you can do (PLLLKLEEEEASE NO MORE TENTACLES or metaballs!) to achieve a certain effect you'd like to make in AVS, like my idea of making smokey flares, and Sauron's eye, as well as a few other things.  &lt;points again to smoking flares for advice about making an original idea by using premade effects to make something very cool and know that it was all your idea&gt;<br />
<br />
Also, when we say to be sure you attach the .avi file or .bmp files, we know that you can't submit a file anywhere remotely resembling the size of a bmp file---so we mean before you submit it to the main winmap.com site or deviantart.<br />
<br />
Just keep that in mind---and above all else...STICK WITH IT!  The hardest part of AVS is the beginning, when (for me anyway) everything is so confusing and it's so hard to make anything that seems anywhere near as cool as your personal favorite presets.  (that's still true for most of us :D UnConeD is, and in my opinion, will remain one of the most innovative AVS artists ever.  That doesn't mean that the rest of us should sweat it when we can't come up with anything nearly as good as him ;)

		You can see some improvement but still you have to get rid of some colors bad effects or the metaballs&amp;tentacles...I see you started to code a bit and i wish you luck but i`ve seen you combined rectangular coordinates with polar ones.First learn how to use x and y in movements and dynamic movements then experiment with x,y,d,r.For example in a movement add x=x-0.05.It will move along the x axis with the speed of 0.05 :) Also for a basic DM add dx=dx+dxb in frame then add dxb=rand(10)/100-rand(10)/100 in beat and finally put x=x+sin(dx) in pixel and switch to rectangular coordinates.Maybe you already know these things but they are a good start in creating movements and DMs.Good luck!

		I'll never, ever use metaballs and tentacles ever again.  Not even as a joke. thanks for all the tips of becoming an avs artist.  I hope not knowing triginometry wont slow me down with learning code but i'll progress with the knowledge i have.

		If you dont know trig just use the sin cos tan asin acos atan with the variables see what each one does and maybe you can figure it out by yourself.I usualy do that(not trig,i know that from the 6th grade).

		What shapes and movements ? Help me help you hehe :) After you learn doing shapes using superscopes and learnd using DMs it will be pretty easy.Im learning new things day by day :) Anyway if you dont know something or need help with anything email or PM me and i`ll try to help.Or you can make a new thread with it :)

		if your a lazy crap then you can cheat and make a circle scope like this:<br />
x=sin(i*pi);<br />
y=cos(i*pi);<br />
and set the n value to 4 for a triangle, 5 for a square, etc etc but i wouldnt advise it (oh and dont forget to set pi in the top box as &quot;pi=acos(-1);&quot;). heres a simple square and triangle made out of scopes with my crappy method of 3d rotation attatched, ignore that, look at the way the points have been plotted in x1 and y1, pick apart the code and learn (but dont steal it ;) ) this uses the &quot;if(equal&quot; method.

		A lot of these presets are very simple they use default movements and ape's. Some  of them like electric river look fairly bad. I would have wrote a longer review but there were a lot of presets.

		you can search the forums and find the 3d ssc base made by elvis (although that one is slow), then modify it according to your own needs, learn ray-tracing and 3d dms. the best way to do that is to tear down other peoples codes and then try to understand it part by part.<br />
most artists use some general variables, eg: sx,sy,sz, etc. are used by most of them for the rotation martix.<br />
then when you have learnt enough, excperiment with ssc's.<br />
type some random equations (this does help, atleast it helped me when i was learning advanced scopes) <br />
:up:<br />
<br />
if you cant understand trig (or dont want to), then the simplest way to draw objects is by using if's<br />
<br />
set count=0 in frame,<br />
the count=count+1 in per point.<br />
this is an ideal method of counting the number of the point.<br />
then by using lot of if's you can plot the points.<br />
<br />
eg:<br />
<pre><code>Pixel:<br />
check=check+1;<br />
x=if(equal(check,1),.5,x);<br />
x=if(equal(check,2),-.5,x);<br />
x=if(equal(check,3),-.5,x);<br />
x=if(equal(check,4),.5,x);<br />
x=if(equal(check,5),.5,x);<br />
<br />
y=if(equal(check,1),.5,y);<br />
y=if(equal(check,2),.5,y);<br />
y=if(equal(check,3),-.5,y);<br />
y=if(equal(check,4),-.5,y);<br />
y=if(equal(check,5),.5,y);<br />
<br />
frame: check=0;<br />
</code></pre> <br />
<br />
this is a too long method, and can be shortened to just a couple of lines. but, you can use this when you are new, especially you are not getting something you want

		Hi welcome to avs.<br />
<br />
A few things:<br />
<br />
1) If you use movements/dynamic movements/superscopes etc. coded by someone else you must ask permission or credit the author.<br />
<br />
2) If you use any external files like APE's, Pictures &amp; AVI's be sure to include the in the pack. Also the dance5.AVI isn't made by you so credit the author for it!<br />
<br />
3) As Raz said, i too strongly advice against of using render APE's such as Metaballs 3D , Tentacles 3D &amp; Fyrewurx. Fyrewurx sucks big time and metaballs&amp;tentacles shouldn't be used again since the original author aka UnConeD already used them in his pack (and coded them).
