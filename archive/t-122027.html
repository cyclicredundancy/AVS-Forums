      <p class="post-content"><strong>My very-first AVS pack</strong><br />
      One day I sat down and started to learn AVS-ing (like regulary).<br />
      Then I thougt: "Hey, enough, why am i learning and not making AVS-es?" and then I made (pretty quicly) my first AVS preset pack.<br />
      There is only 7 presets, thats pecause(spelling) my wizdom is to small to make things i really want... :hang:<br />
      All the criticism is welcome!!! (I sayd ALL!)<br />
      I didnt include much ssc-s (im still learning) and there is only one (or was it 2)DM-s (i know nothing about DM-s)...<br />
      <br />
      Here it is. Here to stay.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There not bad for first avs's, i suggest you make some more before you release a pack and learn avsing while your making them, its the best way to learn IMO, Youve got some nice effects in the and some decent SSs, i think youve used inverts and the whole roto blitter zoomed out spinning aroung a little too much.<br />
      <br />
      I liked the effect you got out of invertation, id suggest putting some sort of superscope in the middle and brightening it up just a little.<br />
      I didnt like black nd white at all, it just dosent do anything except zoom in and out and spin slightly, make the background shapes change around to the music randomly or something like that, maybe add some color.<br />
      Beatcircle was good, i like the whole shiny colours effect, maybe make the superscope change shape a little more and add some more background effects.<br />
      Same with Justasimple, not bad but needs some more happening<br />
      Simple remix, i like the solid colour effect even if it is a little dark.<br />
      Fuzzy cube, i like the superscope but the background effects look too much like something you get when mixing a water and a roto blitter.<br />
      Just colours, nice effect, i like the colours, just make it change a little more.<br />
      <br />
      Not bad overall, keep making and learning. Oh yea and if your going to release a pack include the Apes youve used and credit the author.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Decent first pack. Some tips before you release it:<br />
      simple remix- Add what it is a remix of in the comment. As far as the preset goes it is kinda empty. A nice DM could take care of that. Also, the set render mode pixel width 5 causes the SSC to look blocky. And try to make the SSC more dynamic.<br />
      Black nd white- fix the typo in the title. The flashing is annoying. Also this isn't a true black and white preset(it has color). Repetitive.<br />
      Fuzzy cube- Already talked to you about this one. Make the SSC a bit more dynamic and tone down the colors with the convolution filter- they're a bit bright.<br />
      Invertation- Making up words yields good presets. I like the effect, but change the moving particles to SSC moving particles or texers.<br />
      just a simple- I assume this is what the first one was remixed after? I like the other one a little more.<br />
      just colors- Nice effect, but the movement(roto blitter) isn't that great. The last movement doesn't do anything except flip the image(d=-d) If you turn on blend it will create a tileable image(sorta). The edges of the screen are very noticable in the background.<br />
      Beatsircle- Another misspelling in the title. The water flashing effect isn't that great. The SSC is very repetitive.<br />
      <br />
      Overall:3.5<br />
      Add the APE's if/when you release it. Make the presets more dynamic and add some more. Good job for a first pack. They all are slow moving - make them look a bit faster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Raz_001 you right, I am using to much irverts and rotto plitters.<br />
      Yea plack nd white (Anubis this is not typo and sorry about the circle thing) I included it because I liked the 3D kind effect using colour clips and inverts.<br />
      Anubis2003...I dunno *** about the DM-s.<br />

      <p class="post-content">If it's not a typo then what is "nd"?<br />
      Try starting basic with DM's and once you get 2D DM's working well, then move to 3D. I have also had a lot of trouble with DM's - they're more difficult to visualise than SSC's(for me at least). Tearing apart others presets, reading through the forums, and trying to make up stuff on my own helped me out a lot.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I Aero Primer (really good stuff in there. Its updated soon, i hope)<br />
      II Look others presets and try to guess how it works. Wisest(spelling) learning is learning from others mistakes ;).<br />
      III READ forums!<br />
      IV Make tons of presets<br />
      <br />
      Anubis about that nd (or is it 'nd):<br />
      Do u know game KKND (old one), i looked at this games icon and took nd not and --- games name is (K)ruch (K)ill (N)d (D)estroy. And by the way, if im going to update my pack ill leave that Black nd white out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well just keep tearing apart other peoples DMs and SSs and figuring out how they work, i have to read things about 6 times before i understand them, every time i read some teaching avs 3d math type thing i understand a little more of it. Anyway just keep making a crapload of presets and messing with others and questioning everything and youl get better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK... Here is one AVS what I made for my back, it looks bretty cool but (not again) there is something that I DONT LIKE at all (You can figure it out easily if you look at this preset :down: there [red colour])...<br />
      I think ssc can be made more easily but this is way I made it...<br />
      Plz help me out fix this flaw...<br />
      NB!<br />
      DON'T MAKE ANY CONCLUSIONS(spelling) ABOUT ME IF YOU LOOK THIS PRESET!!!<br />
      <br />
      Oh yea, if you dont find out whats wrong about it then decreace (deam spelling) fadeout...<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">What exactly is the problem with it?<br />
      Here are some optimizations/tips.<br />
      calculate the trig functions per frame and use these variables in per pixel.(i.e. szt=sin(zt);)<br />
      Why do you have green and blue set to -1? the range of colors is (0,1). Also instead of setting them per pixel, you could set them per frame(since they don't change per pixel), or even better, in the color picker(since they never change). I would reccomend having the colors change, however.<br />
      Also, it doesn't have much to it, try adding a background or something and possibly have the star move around.<br />
      Btw, is your backspace key broken or something? (and you did spell conclusions and wisest correctly)</p>

      <p class="post-content">OH! Sorry I thaught that the colour range was -1 to 1... :hang:<br />
      I dont like that the colour is blinking (Or whatever. Impossible to watch it long) and if I set fadeout faster then it looses the "bleeding" effect.<br />
      My backspace key isn't proken (soon it will be if i dont get faster internet connection) but im just too deam lazy (it's my second name) to check the dictionary for the word (was the decreace correct too?)... :hang:<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, the version you posted had the fadeout turned all the way up so you couldn't see it flashing. To help get rid of the flashing, try turning down the fadeout and changing the effect list input blend to multiply blend.<br />
      Also, if you instead get rid of the first blur, turn down the fadeout some, and change the effect list output blend to xor you get a nice firery effect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I haven't checked in on AVS in a while, and I'm just getting around to reviewing all the new packs, but I have to admit that some of the presets in this pack are some of the best ones I've seen coming from a n00b since...well...UnConeD! Keep it up, man.<br />
      <br />
      Just keep those presets that you don't know how to make on a to-do list, and as you learn new stuff, try and see if you can make them. My recommendation is to make several more, hand-pick the best (there's a few in the current selection that I think your pack would be better off without), but the SSC in Beat Circle was GREAT! It's like one of my SSCs...only 3-D (rotations &amp; size changes)! :D And the shape morphs slightly (unlike mine)<br />
      <br />
      Way to go :up:! Be sure you don't clutter your pack with presets that aren't so great, and you'll have a dynamic pack. Try to get your preset number up to @ least 10 (14 would be good), and then think about releasing it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">A Moving Particle superscope can either be a superscope with 1 dot that moves around and has the texer effect applied to it, or a small and tightly packed spiral. The texer approach is much easier plus you can get some nicer effects. The spiral approach was used before texer was created. Here is the fixed SSC</p>

I searched the forums (I just wasted few hours of my day) and red this getting started (or something like this) - nothing, nope, zero, zip, none...<br />
      Maybe U can explayn me the 'thing' little bit. :down: there is my first 3 DM-s (if u want u can download and comment them)...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I like the testing DM, it looks like water flowing. I fixed the DM test 3 and now I'm going to explain alpha blending.<br />
      alpha blending is used to measure transparency. The variable alpha ranges from 0 to 1. At alpha=0 only the unmoved current screen is shown. At alpha=1 the moved screen(selected in source) is shown. At alpha=.5 half of both are shown(this is how the "fog" is created). Also, the blend checkbox must be checked. Try messing with the fixed DM to figure it out(I selected the color red to make it easier to see).</p>

      <p class="post-content">What do you mean by "deform"? If you're referring to the zigzagging edges, it is because of a bug with the DM. You can fix this by increasing grid size. This does, however, slow the preset down.<br />
      The other option that will help hide it is to use a more realistic fog. Yours has definite starting pts. Instead, use something that doesn't jump straight from 0 to 1. I attached an example to help you out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, actualy i wanted roof too but it looks petter without it. ;)<br />
      Well yea, about the deforming: The hole surfase messes up when the DM zooms too much out, I can make it to zoom less out but there must be other solution.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I didn't do both surfaces because I'm lazy.:p By the hole, you are talking about the black part in the back, correct? It doesn't deform on my computer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nope, no black bart, nothing wrong with the fog....<br />
      Deam. Well, how do i say that, emmmmm.... Deam english!<br />
      Ok, perspective of the surface will be messed up and lines will be ****d up, well, deam, how do I say that. Well listen Korn of something with heave beat.<br />
      Im same lazy as U, I know the feeling of beeing lazy :D :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm not positive what you are saying(probably because of translation difficulties), but I believe it is because of the gridsize. And oddly enough I was listening to Thoughtless, by Korn, at the time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it's cause by you z value getting to large. I can't explain why right now. Maby I'll have more luck tomorrow when I'm more awake. It has to do with deviding by a larger z value making the DM get point closer to the zero line.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi, I brought up this old thread pecause it was pointless to wast hole thread for simple question, here it is:<br />
      <br />
      We have 2 lines, we only know the coordinates of the lines, these lines cross in the point X, how can i calculate the point X coordinates olny by using the two points for each line?<br />
      <br />
      Down here is pic. of it. Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you use the functional equation of a line (y in terms of x), you get:<br />
      <br />
      y = mx + d<br />
      <br />
      m is the slope of the line. This is 0 for horizontal (because the y value is constant across all x-es). It's impossible to have vertical lines with this formula because m would have to be infinity.<br />
      <br />
      d is a vertical offset of the line and is the y coordinate of the point on the line with x coordinate 0 (after all, for x=0 the formula gives y = m*0 + d = d). A line that goes through the origin has d=0.<br />
      <br />
      For a line between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) this formula becomes:<br />
      <br />
      (y - y1) = ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1))*(x - x1)<br />
      <br />
      If we simplify it by separating the slope:<br />
      <br />
      m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)<br />
      <br />
      it becomes:<br />
      <br />
      y - y1 = m*(x - x1)<br />
      <br />
      so we know<br />
      <br />
      d = y1 - m*x1<br />
      <br />
      Now to solve your problem. You need to find the intersection point, or in other words the x value for which the y value of both lines is the same.<br />
      <br />
      If m1 is the slope of line1 and d1 is the offset of line1 (m2 and d2 for line two), you need to solve:<br />
      <br />
      m1*x + d1 = m2*x + d2<br />
      <br />
      or<br />
      <br />
      x = (d2 - d1) / (m1 - m2)<br />
      <br />
      This is the x coordinate of the intersection point. To find the corresponding y coordinate you fill in this x coordinate in either the formula for line 1 or 2 (they intersect at that x, so it doesn't matter which one you pick).<br />
      <br />
      Note that this assumes your two lines extend toward infinity in both directions, so check if the resulting point is actually on your lines and not outside them.<br />
      <br />
      If the two lines are parallel (m1 == m2), then you get a division by zero in the result (logical: there is no intersection point)<br />
      <br />
      If the two lines are equal, then you get a 0/0-type undefined result.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks UnConeD, that was really helpfull.<br />
      <br />
      I thought long to post this socalled ssc, to show u if i understand u correctly . This ir REALLY *****y AVS but i hope U can understand this.<br />
      <br />
      I only wanna know if I understood UnConeD correctly.<br />
      <br />
      NB! Sometimes its really hard to guess what point is that correct.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Something is wrong with this. I know the slope equation you have is messed up (y4-y<b>2</b>;)<br />
      I just spent a long time trying to figure it out, and for some reason my method isn't working, even though it should be. Can you figure out why??</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm, yea, britty stupid mistake but, I dont care, because I just made program in Turbo Bascal 7.0 (yea, yea i know thats old and crap and etc.) and it works.<br />
      About ur method I feel that im too stupid to understand whats wrong with it...:rolleyes:<br />
      My (well better lets say UnConeD's) method is working correctly (thanks Anubis), BUT sometimes it doesnt show the X point if it chould :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here it is.<br />
      It does it sometimes when everything chould work (the poin X must be at view), it just doesnt show out that point, sometimes the other points are missing too but it rare.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It seems like when the points are very near to eachother, it may be messing up. Can't figure out why though. Sorry.</p>
