		I don't know, wheather anybody needs this one, but here it is: a simple square made with one superscope.<br />
It's not really a preset - it's only a part for further uses. It could be good for colour effects for example.<br />
For all other purposes you can make the same with 4 superscopes. The square stays also square with few points.<br />
Better you look at it yourself.

		A square isn't exactly revolutionary. <br />
<br />
BTW your colourcoding looks rather bulky and unefficient.  If you use:<br />
red=sin(i-t);<br />
blue=cos(i*2+t2);<br />
green=sin(i*4+t);<br />
<br />
Instead of your code, you can get almost the exact same effect, and make the colours change.

		Hungryskull : His method is quite a bit faster...<br />
<br />
Still, it doesn't support shifting colors.

		I finally figured out how to make the color-shifting.<br />
I only needed one(!) new line and some name replacements,<br />
but almost 30 minutes, 10 grams of paper and 0.5ml ink :eek:

   Didn't notice that, but it seems overly complex for what it has to do.

is that complex enough? :)<br />
so remember: sine is evil :D

		How about making a solid back face culled square that draws in 3d space set by global vars and all you need to input is 3 of the vertices and the normal.. then I *may* be impressed? (This is very possible - i make tons of little prefabs like this, like the analagous pentagons in alien device for instance)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, this is nothing new, you should check out what others have done with AVS. There is a lot more to be done than squares. ;)
