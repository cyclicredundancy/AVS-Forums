			<strong>AVS stability running in Windows 7</strong><br />
		
		

		I've noticed posts in the forums before about two issues: switching presets using global variables, and switching presets using .avi rendering. Under Windows 7, certain presets with these attributes will crash Windows 7 immediately. It would be nice if these Windows 7 bugs could be worked out. Will it ever happen?

		Correction - switching these presets will crash Winamp, not Windows. Anyway, the only workaround I can come up with is to delete or rename offending presets, or disable avi rendering. I guess I'll have to get a PC with hardware acceleration so I can run things in xp mode without fear of crashing Winamp.

		AVS works better with aero turned off, apparently.<br />
<br />
And bugs with APEs such as Global Variable Manager will most probably never get fixed, unless someone else rewrites the APE from scratch - seeing as most people have either lost the source code or just aren't around any more.<br />
<br />
The future of AVS rests solely with the people that can be bothered to work on it, which thankfully <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=321482" target="_blank">does include the original author</a>, but don't expect anything more than you're given.

Unfortunately I'm experiencing these problems and I'm running a 32 bit system. Love your work, BTW.

A real shame. I wonder if he can recode his presets without needing the globalvars plugin. His work is excellent.

		Apart from loading .gvm files, which are rare and I don't believe S-C ever used them, a SSC (or T2 but a SSC would be faster I guess) could do the same - just copy the code.

You're right! I was able to get some presets working doing this. Thanks for the tip.
