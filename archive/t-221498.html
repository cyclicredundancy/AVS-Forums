		I'm no expert, but here's what I think:<br />
<br />
First, it's usually considered a good idea to post files in ZIP format instead of RAR, since it's considered more standard. For example, WinRAR supports the ZIP format, but other compressors don't necessarily support the RAR format. This is the main reason the instructions for posting presets specify the ZIP format.<br />
<br />
Anyway, &quot;Fire Worm&quot; has some pretty good movement, and I like it overall. However, it lacks variety. Once you look at that GIF animation you posted, you've pretty much seen the preset! If you tweak the Superscope slightly so that the curve changes more over time, that'll fix it.<br />
<br />
For example, instead of:<pre><code>sdt=sin(dt+(i*3.1415*2));<br />
cdt=cos(dt+(i*3.1415*2));</code></pre>You could replace the &quot;3.1415*2&quot; constants with variables that'll change to random values (between 0 and 2pi) each beat.<br />
<br />
Consider calculating the value &quot;.6 * sin(t)&quot; once per frame instead of twice per point.<br />
<br />
Also, there are some folks here who tend to not like presets that use pure red, green, and blue colors. (Sometimes they're clever enough to pretend they're being burned by the RGB. Hah hah, quite humorous.) Just be a little more adventurous with the Color Map. This thing will probably look good with all sorts of colors. You can have up to eight maps; use them!<br />
<br />
(Mental note: I should use Color Map more in my own presets.)

		Nice colors going on here, good movment... Looks like you're still learning some of the language, because all of these are kinda based off of examples and presets. That's ok, we all start somwhere. Nice though, looks better than alot of mine!
