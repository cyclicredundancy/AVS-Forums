<div class="posttext">ok ok, this would be a pretty difficult preset but it would be very very very sweet.  Can anyone out there make a rotating skeleton, preferrably also running, out of superscopes?  maybe also, a total recall preset, using that same idea.. :weird: also if anyone can do one that looks like you're flying like 10 feet over water or flying in the sky in general, i haven't seen one that could truly take advantage of the scenery from 20,000 feet down to 200 feet. would be a very cool preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Both of these have already been made. Elvis made a starwars preset that looks like two ships flying back and forth over clouds. He also made a virtual dancer as has unconed and several other people. Unconed also made a nuclear war preset where Earth is being blasted by nuclear explosions.  Good ideas, but they have been done.<br />
&lt;EDIT&gt;<br />
Oh and in response to your question about AVS 3 - there may never be one. Nullsoft doesn't seem to have any plans of updating it.  The soonest that I could see it coming out is not until after they finish working out the bugs in Winamp3.<br />
&lt;/EDIT&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does a running man made from ellipsoids qualify? If so await 'Jheriko - Pack VIII' there will be one in there. ;)</div></div><hr />
