      <p class="post-content">I don't wanna get off on a rant here, but I don't like seeing these halfassed AVS packs getting published with four and a half stars when they clearly desearve less. It's almost impossible to make a good avs without a movement of some sort, and here some packs that only use the preset movements. I understand that they do come in handy but it's usually best to use your own. You don't even have to be a mathmetician, just use trial and error people. I'm just saying this because I have recently DLed two packs that got fairly good reviews but have been nothing special. for now on I'm gonna stay away from the ones that have the word "solid" in the review.</p>

      yeah, i've seen some really, IMO, half-assed presets get graded really well. i haven't been doing this much...but if you think it's half-assed and deserves a lower rating, rate it. but don't just rate low without leaving constructive criticism.</p>

      <p class="post-content">sorry I took so long to reply. Scarface your presets are interesting but you have one dangerous downfall. the bumps are overwhelming and make it hard to see anything else. try putting everything else into an effect list and the bumps outside.you can do that with other trans and experiment with the effect list settings. but your square scopes are really cool, mind if I use them for some of my presets?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well my superscope are quite easy (easy being simple) all i do is make one super scope and make 7 more and cvhagne them so they went into differetn directions. and as for the bumps, and difficlut to see, i only have one answer for you...<br />
