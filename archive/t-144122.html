<br />
<div class="posttext">bigbro - A bit n00bish.  Could use some nicely coded SSCs instead of all of the simple's which are going crazy.  The actual eye part doesn't look much like an eye and is very rough.<br />
Blud, etc - Definitely better if you take out the sunburster movements, but it could use something else to replace them.  Don't like timescopes that much, and the text makes it kinda weird.<br />
Bob - Besides the obvious edges and the warping caused by the DM, this is an OK preset.  The SSC could be a bit more dynamic with colors too.<br />
Colour Rush - Don't like how you just took one of the built-in SSCs and multiplied it a bunch of times.  Not the first time someone has done this kind of effect with that SSC either.<br />
Core Of Darkness - The first effect list doesn't need to be there - just take the clear screen out of it.  You can also turn off &quot;clear every frame&quot; in the main window.  Don't like the fluid ape.  Also, you get the same basic effect with the nested effect list if you make it a replace/replace EL and take out the buffer save.  This preset needs some speed.<br />
Fire And Ice - It's very n00bish, and I've seen presets almost the exact same before.<br />
Green Woosh Thing - Nice one although I would replace the roto blitter with a DM.<br />
Hippy Shapes - You may want to include the picture - I got no picture.  The only decent part of this preset is the SSC you borrowed.<br />
Inverty Upside Your Head - Don't really like it.  The foreground stuff is a little cheap, and the background is just a SVP.<br />
Kalideo - You may want to figure out who's DM that is.  The first EL is unnecessary - just move everything in it outside of the EL and delete the EL.  This preset flashes too much.<br />
Lazerz - This could be done almost identically in a much simpler manner - all of the stuff after the psychotic beaming ******d movement is almost pointless - it makes very little difference - all you really need to keep your effect would be a mirror.  The stuff before could be done in one SSC too.  That out of the way, this is an extrememly overdone preset.  Try to be more original.<br />
Orb Of Gold - I don't think that is your DM - make sure you credit whoever made it.  It's an ok preset, though.<br />
Puddle Of Bludd - You can turn off &quot;clear every frame&quot;.  Don't really like it - no real background, and the SSC isn't much.<br />
Pyramid Galxay + - Don't use the Source Map in the sigmoid movement - it makes it look horrible, IMO.  Would be better if the movements were DMs instead - right now, it's fairly static because of that.<br />
Pyramid Galxay Glyph - Replace/Replace ELs do nothing(unless if you are using them for onbeat stuff) - just move the stuff inside out and delete the EL.  Also, you shouldn't have both enabled and enabled on beat checked.  If you want it to be on beat then uncheck &quot;enabled&quot;.  Don't really like the preset much.<br />
Pyramid Galxay Phoenix - This is starting to get a bit repetitive.<br />
Spectro Orb - Is that your DM?  Don't like the texture.<br />
Starz 'N' Spins - OMG, those are rotating stars.  NEXT!!<br />
Up All Night - Your dm?  The texture is just blue for most of it - you can hardly see that this is another orb preset.<br />
Overall: 2.5.  Could use some more originality, and you still have a lot to learn about AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad but not too good, you have plenty room for improvement, and that &quot;Inverty...&quot; preset goes really good with Voronoi. And btw. say hi to Sgt. Colon  (lame Discworld pun? - everybody else).</div></div><hr />
