<div class="posttext">Looks like everyone is avoiding to write a review ;) I guess I'll give in.<br />
<br />
Ok, I can't believe I'm doing this, but here goes.<br />
<br />
Intro - Very cool movements.  The background looks a bit n00bish, but not in a bad way. :) <br />
<br />
Kaleido Fun - Kinda slow, one of those presets that makes you say &quot;come on come on come on hurry up and get good!&quot; other than that it's cool.<br />
<br />
Odour Control - Don't really like the colors (gray and yellow?!?  Good God man, what were you thinking???) but it's ok.<br />
<br />
MTV3 Summer - Neat, but kinda boring.  Still good though.<br />
<br />
Under Sea Path - Now THIS is cool.  Landscape presets are usually a little crude, but you've made a nice, smooth, happy colored preset.  Sort of like a Disney movie!:p <br />
<br />
Rust Spectrum - I dig every thing about this preset!  Good Job!<br />
<br />
Piknik - Boring.  Not your best work, but I guess everyone gets a little stuck sometimes.<br />
<br />
Lego Blocks - Weirdass but cool DM.  I can see you as 5 years old playing with legos building a lego computer or something:p <br />
<br />
Digital Candy - Nice Colors, but I don't like the mosaic touch very much.:( <br />
<br />
Different Load - Sweet!  Like a transluscent Death Star!<br />
<br />
Weird Milks - Nice, but &quot;milk?&quot;  Kind of......:igor: <br />
<br />
Worm O Rama - The first time I saw this preset I watched it for 10 minutes straight.....so many lines intersecting constantly.....than I looked off the screen and I saw everything in my house intersecting constantly.....it just proves you really don't need pot for trippin' :D <br />
<br />
Molecule Blobs - (Scmptgk.) I wasn't gonna say anything.<br />
<br />
Winamp Vis - Nice visualduplication!  You did good on the scopes.<br />
<br />
Orb of Destruction - Very cool.<br />
<br />
Weird Blob - Weird.  It's a bit boring, sorry.<br />
<br />
Shiny metal curves - The name excited me! :igor: Very Nice.<br />
<br />
Audio Candy - Nice flowy fading background.  <br />
<br />
Medipack - Nice Scopes!  I have not played Quake or Unreal, but I have played enough RPG games to know what it means. :) <br />
<br />
Magma Flow II - I liked your first one better.  Cool embossing technique though.<br />
<br />
Trippster - Cool!  It may be a bit similar to a few presets, but it's faster, and it makes me feel....funny.<br />
<br />
Matrix Tribute - I don't care what other people say, I totally agree with you Tug, The Matrix Reloaded kicks major ass.  Oh and nice preset too. :D <br />
<br />
Particle Accelerator - Reminds me of UnConeD's &quot;Containment&quot; preset.  <br />
<br />
Golden Age - Wow this is so not you!  Usually these are Jim-type presets, but you pulled it off!<br />
<br />
Sha-la-la-la - Makes me think of a 12 year old bubble gum chewing empty headed little girl listening to N'Sync. :D <br />
<br />
Hypersmooth+ - Woah dats coo!  I slippin' dis straight up, bu!<br />
<br />
Solero Shots - I have not had this candy before.  Sounds good.  So is this preset.<br />
<br />
Scope In Spotlights - Well that's a neat trick!  Nice job.<br />
<br />
Snake Skin - Awesome!  Shiny Blurry....Fun.<br />
<br />
Worm o rama arcade RmX - Wow!  Just like on the cell phone!  Cool!<br />
<br />
Worm or Rama Nic RmX - Not much.  I love the watery colorful effect though, fantastic.<br />
<br />
Nic's Weirder Blob - Definitley Weird.<br />
<br />
Worm O Rama Raz RmX- WAAAA!!! This preset is da bomb! Only one thing - it should go into the east and west corridors.  I wanna see what's over there! :D  <br />
<br />
Pik Slash Nik - Nice preset <br />
<br />
Jungle Fever - Woah way too bright.  I wanna be this guy right now :cool: <br />
<br />
Lactic Acid - Strange Remix<br />
<br />
Sidds Weird Blob RmX - Still not much.<br />
<br />
Space Tag RmX - I don't know!!! :igor: :igor: :igor: <br />
<br />
Piknik Cartoon RmX - Cool shading effect!  WHAT THE?!?! There is a DEER  tapping its antlers on my window!!  (this has absolutley nothing to do with this preset)  Ok it's gone now.  That freaked me out for a minute! :eek: <br />
<br />
Shreyas Odour Control RmX - Not much different than the original.<br />
<br />
Jello Worm o Rama - That is so cool!  Nice job Ishan!<br />
<br />
Mquadrat Worm O Rama RmX - Holy Smokes!  I didn't know you could make presets like these Mquadrat!  Best RmX of the pack! :up:<br />
<br />
Weird Blob Magic RmX - Uh, this just got a bit dumber....<br />
<br />
Cube Me Up RmX - Very Smooth!  Good Preset.<br />
<br />
Piknik Crap RmX - PAK-9 are you being sarcastic?  This thing is awesome! :)<br />
<br />
Digitize Me RmX - Very nice.  Kind of like FSK's &quot;Ice Cube&quot; preset.<br />
<br />
Worm O Rama Jumpy RmX - It's ok I guess....<br />
<br />
Worm O Rama Data Stream RmX - Hell Yeah!  Very Nice!  Looks like deviantart. :p <br />
<br />
WwWwWwWwWow.  That took me exactly 1 hour and 28 minutes to write.  Wait, will Tuggummi be here to read to this?  Oh well I don't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Really don't have anything to say that hasn't beed said before, other than: SCHWEET!<br />
<br />
Worm-o-rama + Hypernet is an awesome combo btw, though only if you modify the scopes so they draw short linesegments instead of dots, and wrap around the edges correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Awesome pack! Great variety of presets in there, and it doesn't get old at all. Also, the presets that used 3D used it very effectively (especially your arcade remix of Worm-O-Rama). Nice job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th June 2003, 13:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks again ya all for the feedback, i appreciate it :up:<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
UnConeD: I doubt i can make them draw as lines and still make it work... And i don't quite understand the wrap thing... i know the convo blur blurs it that the edges of the screen look a bit ugly, but if you take it away it should look continuos and the wrapping looks fine to me.<br />
<br />
And for you 3D freaks imma gonna say that i doubt i will be doing much 3D, It's just so much harder to experiment and get nice result when dealing with an extra dimension and since i have actually no clue how the hell i pull my stuff out, i doubt i can do anything great with 3D. I will just stick to my regular ways of avsing.</div></div><hr />
