      <p class="post-content">Ok i got that Bug. On first startup, the Language Pack is loaded after the configurations. Thats why LAnguage Problems. The Loading Error is caused by wrong File Settings.<br />
      <br />
      I got both things fixed, but i'm still setting up the Install Shield Wizard to provide a proper Installation System next time.<br />
      <br />
      This should solve most of those problems, because the setup was included within the executable (it creates new folders and files, if they're placed wrong, you cant use Hotlist)<br />
      <br />
      I'm gonna upload it as soon as possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">typoes in english trans:<br />
      <br />
      "does'nt" -&gt; "doesn't"<br />
      "does already exists." -&gt; "already exists"<br />
      "informations" -&gt; "information" (has no plural in english)<br />
      "Foreward" -&gt; "Forward"<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You should standardize your capitalisation by the way. 'Typing Sentences Like This With All or some Words Capitalised' is weird to read.<br />
      <br />
      And if you have to include variables in a sentence, it's best to use the following system:<br />
      "Preset %preset does not exist." instead of "Preset" and "does not exist".<br />
      If you include multiple unknowns in one sentence, some languages will reverse the order and will be unable to use your system.</p>

      <p class="post-content">@ UnConeD: Yeah, typoes, i knew there would be some. Why don't you write a language pack, it would be better then my crappy english :D<br />
      Just send it as an Email, i'm gonna add it to my code then. (Oh and you could review the doc as well then ;) )<br />
      <br />
      @ legohead: it doesnt do anything midi related. Version one was hotkey based, but i experienced that this was a bad way to control avs. I know it would be nice to control avs via midi, but there's no point in doing this would be very unorganized.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Checked it out and I must say I LOVE it:up: . just what I was wishing for (some wishes do come true:)yay). I even made the pointles slovenian lanuguage pack:D. I will send it to you anyway.<br />
      <br />
      There are two things that bother me though. The fist one is you cant save lists (I'll get over this:)), and the second one which is easy to solve is I HATE THE NO PICTURE graphic. I hate it as much as I love Hotlist. Its just useles, you cant see it among all the preset pictures:(. I edited the bitmap to my own needs (made a BIG red x on white background and wrote NO PICTURE below - works perfectly), but if you choose to delete all the pictures the file gets replaced :mad: :hang:.<br />
      <br />
      Please,please,please,please change that picture,or code it so that it wount change it back :)<br />
      <br />
      I sugest a bigg red X on white background without the text because that gets messed up with resizeing.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, love what you did, THANK YOU for shareing it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK, I have an idea:).<br />
      it would be cool to have 'save to hotkey 1,2,3,...' options,<br />
      when you right click on a preset and that list drops down.<br />
      The first 10 keys would be enough.<br />
      <br />
      I would love this function:)<br />
      <br />
      Could you explain what the hell is the difference between edit and non edit mode:?<br />
      <br />
      The new version doesn't remember which language I use:(<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      p.s. others arent VJing, thats why they dont give a rats ass about the software:D. I used it this weekend:).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Editing mode will show / hide the file selection ont the left side.<br />
      I dont know why the Language is not remembered,it should be stored in the registry at local_machine/software/hotlist, please check that.<br />
      <br />
      But this will change in V2.2 too as Language Packs will use placeholders then (as UnConed suggested).<br />
      <br />
      New Features that already work:<br />
      -Onbeat Presetchanging through an APE<br />
      -Loading &amp; Saving of Multiple Lists, even allows adding existing lists :D<br />
      -Extended, hideable Status Bar<br />
      -Extended Main Menu<br />
      -Deleting all currently not used Pictures (very usefull)<br />
      -New Language Pack Style<br />
      -Edit Area now sizeable<br />
      -Automation now on a seperate hideable ToolBar<br />
      <br />
      Planned but not done:<br />
      -Loading all pictures on Startup and only once.<br />
      -NSIS Installer ;)<br />
      -Allow multiple instances of one Preset<br />
      -Allow custom sort of Presets (Drag &amp; Drop)<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, Hotkeys again?!<br />
      <br />
      I used Hotkeys for Version 1, but this way was (as i experienced) a bit too complicated, so i introduced clicking :D<br />
      <br />
      Well in addition it could be usefull again.<br />
      <br />
      But:<br />
      When the ListView is selected and you hit a key, Hotlist will jump to the first entry beginning with the typed letter. Therefore, Hotkeys would only be good with the F Keys, otherwise there would be conflict.<br />
      <br />
      To explain how Hotlist works:<br />
      -it saves the location of the presets<br />
      -onload, it copies the prest to AVS/F1.aph andsimulates F1 beeing pressed<br />
      <br />
      Possible Solution:<br />
      <br />
      Hotlists FKey is changed to F12<br />
      On demand, single prests are copied to F1 - F11 sperately<br />
      If you enable the Hotkey passthrough, you can access them now directly<br />
      <br />
      Or do you want this to be handled by Hotlist iself (Remeber the Preset, handle it as loading, resetting the counter and so on)?</p>

      If you want a preview, here is the current state of work, something between alpha and beta: <a href="http://de.geocities.com/ronnydathe/index.htm" target="_blank">Hotlist V2.2 Preview</a>.<br />
      I doesnt come with any language packs yet. Furthermore, be sure to add a "User Lists" Folder to your Hotlist Folder and copy the Language Packs to a "Laguage Packs" Folder.<br />

      Magic, i did test Hotlist eventually, but it didn't seem to work at all. It did launch the program and you could select a list of avs presets, but it didn't load them in the avs window... Also i got a lot of these error messages (all in german :igor:) when i launched &amp; closed the program...<br />

      <p class="post-content">As I noticed it, the error happens if you dont have the directories set right(or if winamp and hotlist are installed on a server:)).The bugg that bothers me most is the thing with screenshoots in XP, but as you said you dunno why its there and therfore cant fix it:).Anyway im realy looking forward to the realese of the software because I dont wanna do the whole screen shot thing over and over again, and this version is gonna have saveble lists and whatnot(roXorz):).</p>

      <br />
      To make the screenshot more stable i added a Delay for next version which will give the AVS window enough time to be brought to front. I dont actually know but maybe this also helps to solve the XP problem.</p>

      Just replace your old version. The first run may seem to be a bit odd, after the second everything will be ok. And get the beatdetector APE out of the 2.2 Preview or from the new Version of Playlister (made the APE compatible to Playlister, so Goeb has it too ;))</p>

      <p class="post-content">fsk, the bugged version is already online, so if you want it that bad you can go and try out :-)<br />
      <br />
      This version seems to be unable to load &amp; save the settings file (previous hotlist) and retrieves errors but by playing around you'll get it to work so you can test it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey magic x, thanks for the soft am checking it out now, i assume its similar to Playlister (i think that's what its called).<br />
      <br />
      but what i would like most now for avs is a video capture plugin that works!<br />
      <br />
      and that you can play the same avi in consecutive presets without it not playing the second time or crashing!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Exeris, it's a proggy for the same purpose but they differ here and there in style and functionality. :)<br />
