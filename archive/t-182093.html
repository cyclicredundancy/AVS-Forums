		The melting probably was the harder one, but it looks cool :D<br />
<br />
The Jello one was... weird... :weird: But i guess there is some attraction to that too, if it would only be controlled by music and not the by user... *sigh*

		tug - jello was much...much...much harder.  melting was about 20 minutes in the making :P<br />
<br />
and on jello, colors are music responsive, and i'll eventually make it so that the bumpy thing is music responsive when the mouse is offscreen.  also if you click it...it goes smush ^u^

		Atero, oh, i just thought that making 1337 coding was easy for you, but the simple beautiful ones were hard :( My bad.<br />
<br />
And if you do the things for Jello then it will be great :D

		I like the idea on Jello, but it's too bad it freaks out when you move the mouse out of the window. A simple max(min(mouse,1),-1) should fix this.<br />
<br />
Melting is cool too (is that possible with such a name?)

		it !freaks out'?<br />
<br />
this is the updated version, with the bump position beat response thing-y.<br />
<br />
(side note: min(abs(mouse),1) is much easier/faster than min(max(mouse,-1),1))

		min(abs(mouse),1) is not equivalent to min(max(mouse,-1),1))<br />
<br />
but you're right it's faster ;)<br />
but if you correct it and write<br />
sign(mouse)*min(abs(mouse),1)<br />
then it might use 1 cycle more and is probably in no event faster than the min/max thing<br />
it all depends on the quality of implementation ;)

		ack, right tomylobo...i was thinking the test to make sure it is inside: below(abs(mouse),1) rather than band(above(mouse,-1),below(mouse,1))<br />
<br />
and i know i'll sound stupid to people like ucd asking this, but is band(,) faster than *?

		my manual says 3/1 for FMUL on Pentium... that's not really an expensive operation ^^<br />
even cheaper than FTST which would be needed at least twice for band(,)<br />
<br />
summary: sounds stupid but * is faster :)

		I actually had something in the works that was fairly similar to Jello.  Realizing that it was beyond my capabilities to make it without using 100 separate scope, I abandoned it.  Good to see you came through!  It's fun for like the first minute, but after that, get's boring, keep with it, interactive stuff is always fun.
