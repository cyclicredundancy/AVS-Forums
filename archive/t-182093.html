<div class="posttext">first post in a long time.<br />
one of them was really easy to make, and they other wasn't.  guess which is which.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The melting probably was the harder one, but it looks cool :D<br />
<br />
The Jello one was... weird... :weird: But i guess there is some attraction to that too, if it would only be controlled by music and not the by user... *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">melting one is really... mm... creamy, I really like it</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">jello is funneh :D add some onbeat-move-randomly-stuff and it's even a vis ;)<br />
and melting: now it looks good (and also more unique ;))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">tug - jello was much...much...much harder.  melting was about 20 minutes in the making :P<br />
<br />
and on jello, colors are music responsive, and i'll eventually make it so that the bumpy thing is music responsive when the mouse is offscreen.  also if you click it...it goes smush ^u^</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, oh, i just thought that making 1337 coding was easy for you, but the simple beautiful ones were hard :( My bad.<br />
<br />
And if you do the things for Jello then it will be great :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I like the idea on Jello, but it's too bad it freaks out when you move the mouse out of the window. A simple max(min(mouse,1),-1) should fix this.<br />
<br />
Melting is cool too (is that possible with such a name?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th June 2004, 22:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">it !freaks out'?<br />
<br />
this is the updated version, with the bump position beat response thing-y.<br />
<br />
(side note: min(abs(mouse),1) is much easier/faster than min(max(mouse,-1),1))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th June 2004, 00:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">min(abs(mouse),1) is not equivalent to min(max(mouse,-1),1))<br />
<br />
but you're right it's faster ;)<br />
but if you correct it and write<br />
sign(mouse)*min(abs(mouse),1)<br />
then it might use 1 cycle more and is probably in no event faster than the min/max thing<br />
it all depends on the quality of implementation ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can't see jello. there is black window without any movement.<br />
Latest version of AVS is 2.81b or later?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">@ OMIDAN: move your mouse over it.<br />
<br />
Wow, I love these presets :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ack, right tomylobo...i was thinking the test to make sure it is inside: below(abs(mouse),1) rather than band(above(mouse,-1),below(mouse,1))<br />
<br />
and i know i'll sound stupid to people like ucd asking this, but is band(,) faster than *?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th June 2004, 20:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">my manual says 3/1 for FMUL on Pentium... that's not really an expensive operation ^^<br />
even cheaper than FTST which would be needed at least twice for band(,)<br />
<br />
summary: sounds stupid but * is faster :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I actually had something in the works that was fairly similar to Jello.  Realizing that it was beyond my capabilities to make it without using 100 separate scope, I abandoned it.  Good to see you came through!  It's fun for like the first minute, but after that, get's boring, keep with it, interactive stuff is always fun.</div></div><hr />
