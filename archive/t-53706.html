      <p class="post-content">Ok, i posted my plug-in's last night and then today i go to see if they got published and my account wouldn't work. so i made a new one today. But I still need help with a few things anyway. I'm not sure how to get screen shots of the avs that i make. small or large. I do know how to make them .exe 's but no clue on the pics. Thnx i'd say that'd be it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To make a screenshot, press the Print Screen key (up above the insert key). Then paste the shot into a graphics program, such as Paint Shop Pro. Something that can save in JPEG or GIF format. Something that isn't Paint. Then crop the image down to just the portion you want.<br />
      <br />
      Although I have no idea how you would've been able to submit your plugin without a screenshot.</p>
