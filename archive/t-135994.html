<div class="posttext">What i think? Well i really think you should get atleast some kind of a ZIP program (i.e. winzip (http://www.winzip.com)) , because it's really annoying that you have to rename the file to even see it...<br />
<br />
Also i think you should've posted this in the AVS PRESETS subforum rather than to the mainpage.<br />
<br />
On the preset i just have to say that please don't use so many numpoints, it's really friggin slow! You can decrease the numpoint value to 800 (in the flower scopes) and the decrease the r=i*3.14159*1000; to r=i*3.14159*100; Really gives it a speed up! Also when dealing with solid scopes, it's better to use Misc / set render mode's line width too. Rather than using 8000 numpoints... Usually line width set to 2 or 3 is enough for solid scopes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This preset looks OK but the second effect list is quite n00bish. Also get some Zip software so that we don't have to rename the preset to open it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*sigh*, open up folder options from one fo the tabs at the top in any folder (in win98 it's &quot;veiw) and click on the view tab once you've got folder options open, now uncheck the box that says, &quot;hide file extensions for known file types&quot;, now click ok and get zip file and rename the end from .zip to .avs</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that has what to do with the quality of an AVS preset?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nothing, it's a courtesy to the rest of us. You want people to look at the preset, make it simple to look at. If I don't like it, I don't want to have to drill down to my presets dir (5 levels, 7 if I used WA 3)to delete it. If you zip it you can click the open button which downloads to a temp dir which is deleted on occasion. Then if I like the preset, I can extract it.<br />
<br />
But I'm not Atero, he may have a completely different reasoning than me.</div></div><hr />
