<div class="posttext">Hi all, Unconed and crew.<br />
<br />
It happened me a few times that after a new windows setup and installing winamp, i get AVS to run unproperly.<br />
<br />
I canot guess what it is caused by but it results in black/colored screens with no objects displaying correctly.<br />
<br />
It all happens with deffault presets that usualy are shiny and all.<br />
<br />
Beatdetection seems like working (tested with &quot;simle&quot;)<br />
<br />
Stuff like superscope and all doesnt render at all.<br />
<br />
Roto and trans effects seems ok koz some presets gives render....<br />
<br />
but again, most presets results in a one-color screen....<br />
<br />
<br />
I had the same problem in the past, reinstalling winamp is no use.<br />
<br />
Mayby there is some dependencies that AVS has that arent installed with windows deffault.....erh.....no way...<br />
<br />
There sure is something wrong anyway!<br />
<br />
Milkdrop displays fine.<br />
<br />
AVS uses only CPU to render so it sure has nothing to do with my videocard drivers..........Mayby a direct X update?<br />
<br />
I'll try that now...Updating DX.....<br />
<br />
I'll edit the post with adding the result just in case i would finaly get a render or not and let you use your experienced mind to enlight my path:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It has nothing to do with screen-size. Neither with overlay or normal render.<br />
<br />
I tried evrything...<br />
<br />
I,ll jsut look now what it did with the direct-x upgrade....<br />
<br />
Seems fine... Yeah.. Fine now....<br />
<br />
Mayby that's just why i get bad displays in aVS each time i reinstall hehe <br />
<br />
Thanx for wondering anyway... now it seems to work perfectly!<br />
<br />
So many colors O_O</div></div><hr />
