      Hi all, Unconed and crew.<br />
      <br />
      It happened me a few times that after a new windows setup and installing winamp, i get AVS to run unproperly.<br />
      <br />
      I canot guess what it is caused by but it results in black/colored screens with no objects displaying correctly.<br />
      <br />
      It all happens with deffault presets that usualy are shiny and all.<br />
      <br />
      Beatdetection seems like working (tested with "simle")<br />
      <br />
      Stuff like superscope and all doesnt render at all.<br />
      <br />
      Roto and trans effects seems ok koz some presets gives render....<br />
      <br />
      but again, most presets results in a one-color screen....<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I had the same problem in the past, reinstalling winamp is no use.<br />
      <br />
      Mayby there is some dependencies that AVS has that arent installed with windows deffault.....erh.....no way...<br />
      <br />
      There sure is something wrong anyway!<br />
      <br />
      Milkdrop displays fine.<br />
      <br />
      AVS uses only CPU to render so it sure has nothing to do with my videocard drivers..........Mayby a direct X update?<br />
      <br />
      I'll try that now...Updating DX.....<br />
      <br />
      I'll edit the post with adding the result just in case i would finaly get a render or not and let you use your experienced mind to enlight my path:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It has nothing to do with screen-size. Neither with overlay or normal render.<br />
      <br />
      I tried evrything...<br />
      <br />
      I,ll jsut look now what it did with the direct-x upgrade....<br />
      <br />
      Seems fine... Yeah.. Fine now....<br />
      <br />
      Mayby that's just why i get bad displays in aVS each time i reinstall hehe<br />
      <br />
      Thanx for wondering anyway... now it seems to work perfectly!<br />
      <br />
      So many colors O_O</p>
