			<strong>Speeding up a preset</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Can someone give me some suggestions as to how to speed up this preset?? It runs horribly slow as it uses a lot of effects.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to keep it looking the same and  make it simpler??<br />
<br />
It's supposed to resemble being on acid or something, standing on a balcony looking across at another building.<br />
<br />
If theres no way to speed it up i'll have to dump it from the pack, but i think it looks better than most of my previous stuff.

			<strong>a few ideas</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		First off, any attempts of mine to speed it up are probably ruining the best parts of your preset, so don't take it personally.  First off, things like excessive use of blur at different points in effect lists really slows things down.  --edit:  you don't have a problem with excessive blurs; so not much you can do there--Secondly, I know you're using your effect lists, but you might try compromising the quality for removing a few of those effect lists.  Division in equations slows things down especially if you use them often.  Blend also slows things down.  <br />
<br />
Try downloading some of the presets in my Preview Pack to see what makes them go so fast (there are a few exceptions to the fact that they're generally high fps (like my LOTR presets)).  I designed many of them for high fps, so they don't have the stuff that slows many presets down (even though that stuff is what often makes the presets so cool).  For ideas on how to change your approach at creating a visual effect, see the change in my presets in my LOTR fans thread.  I totally switched my approach halfway through (you can probably seee when I switched by my presets appearance alone)<br />
<br />
In short, the only way to speed things up is to take away things you think are essential to the preset, so there isn't an easy way to do it; you have to start with fairly simple projects, and then add stuff that will give you the most fps for the visual effect it would create.  I'll explain more later :)<br />
<br />
edit:  I updated the file so it didn't mess everything up so much

		Yeh, i know what you mean. This is a fairly complicated preset when it comes to effect lists, I've tried removing a few but it just spoils the look. I've also tried removing the dm's but again, it ruins it.<br />
<br />
I might have to dump this one from the pack, it runs at about half the fps of my other presets and would just be too much for an older computer to handle. <br />
<br />
I get 12 fps at 320x200 which is unaceptable for that res. :(
