      <p class="post-content"><strong>Overlay not working on newer PC</strong><br />
      here's the deal:<br />
      I have an old custom built PC from 1996, running windows 98 se, with a version of "netscape winamp" back in the very old days I suppose.<br />
      And then a newer PC, just bought in 2003, running XP at 512 mb RAM, P4, and a much better graphics card, with Winamp 5.03.<br />
      Overlay mode only works on the older PC, not at all on the newer one, but the newer one is the only one of the two fast enough to run it.<br />
      So what is the deal? I have friends using XP, they use overlay. 5.03 isn't the problem, because I have tried this with every version back to 2.80.<br />
      Overlay just does not initialize, and I have no background, active desktop off(as far as I know, as I can't find the damn option in XP).<br />
      Anybody know how I can fix this?</p>
