      This is something i wanted to do for a while, but just couldn't be arsed. I did it over the last few days though, although i did most of it today, then lost all i did, then did it again. Which to say the least, was a monstrous pain in the arse. There is a stupid ammount of scopes but i finally got the hang of a few techniques and put this together. Disable the unique tone at the end for a different look.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very cool scope and DM work. The only bad thing is the color scheme, which is too simplistic IMO (with or without the UT). That shouldn't be too hard to tweak compared to all the scopes. :) :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Man, you just can't get away from Starbug, can you? :p<br />
      <br />
      Maybe some variation in the buildings to spice things up. And what are the rays comming off of starbug to the buildings?</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's where the lines poke out when they go behind the viewpoint and where i couldn't be bothere going through all those scopes and tweaking the colour. ;)<br />
      <br />
      I think i will change the shape of some of the buildings, it requires recoding the movement of them though, i've tried to think of ways to turn but to no avail. I doubt that'll happen anythime soon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice job, though indeed some variation in the buildings would be nice. And for the final version, you should get rid of the lines coming out the ...thing. Overal nice preset :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heheheh, we all hate those lines...<br />
      <br />
      The key is to also fade out the points before (after?) the out-of-field-o'-vision points... however you'd do that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heh, i too find it easier to sync a massive ammount of scopes rather than trying to bust my ass and create it in one scope :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">Why don't you use skip now for avoiding the lines going to/from the center? Also, your camera snapping has a jump in it. In your case it's easy to avoid: just make sure you subtract one block length when you snap back, instead of setting to 0 or so.</p>
