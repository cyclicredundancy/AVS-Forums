Remember all the talk about an AVS tutorial a couple of days ago? Well, I did some work and put together the AVS discussion (http://www.geocities.com/avsdiscussion)site :). It has the tutorial by Linus (Linus, I hope you don't mind :) that I used it. I also had to do some editing. You'r name is in the credits. I can take it out or change the information). Napolean is working on a new one. It also has an index page but there is nothing there. Can someone please write some AVS terms and their definitions for me to post on the site. I'll list your name in the credits. If you have anything I can maybe put on there, send me an e-mail to roman@roma-graphics.com. The time is running out. I have only 5 days of Internet left. So visit the site and tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks man<br />
<br />
I went to the site you've mentioned. It's pretty cool. However my site is still undergoing development. And it is tightly focused on helping people who are new to AVS. I can make it better if I had more info about AVS. I only have Linus's tutorial there. What do you think I should add.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, haven't had the time to reply.<br />
I checked out the site, it looks pretty cool with a glossary(?, not sure), with explenations of every function in avs. I can't wait tilÂ´ this is up ;)<br />
Maybe you should put up my tutorial as a beginner tutorial and place the superscope &amp; movement section in *Syntax info* or something, then try getting someone to make a deeper tutorial on superscopes and movements, explaining every function in detail. Paranoya?, Unconed?, anyone?, hehe.<br />
But using my tutorial is alright, i'm happy that it's in a place where i didn't have to put it up myself, you can have it to blue ;p<br />

<div class="posttext">Please read the &quot;need info for project thread&quot;.<br />
<br />
 I have a great concept, but need some help defining some variables and their uses. Anyways, go read the other thread please, I posted all the info there. <br />
<br />
 If you know anything about AVS, from simple to complicated, your help would be appreciat6ed. You will be credited for your help and I think this project might just make it big...<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I could use a little help with the tutorial. I need some info to put in my index page. I think NApoleAN is working on a tutorial but i haven't heard from him in a while. So if you have any ideas, info or other useful stuff feel free to send me an e-mail (i really need to put something on the index page).</div></div><hr />
