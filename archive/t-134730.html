			<strong>Strange bugs with publishing my pack on Winamp.com</strong><br />
		
		

		There is a strange bug with Fire AVS 2.<br />
It was published on 4th of May, but I didn't get the e-mail.<br />
There was no Staff Comment and it was rated 0 stars ALL.<br />
Also there is an error with picture.<br />
I commented my pack so anyone at Nullsoft may nitice this bug, I've sent a feedback with a cry for help, but it seems that nobody heared me.<br />
Forum is my last hope.<br />
<br />
<font size="3"><b>NULLSOFT, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PACK?</b></font> <br />
<br />
It's not about my browser, I've tested my pack's page in Netscape and Opera 7 - doesn't make it any better...<br />
<br />

		well, happened to me too - monochrome pack wouldnt get published, so I went to edit my pack and what do i see, there was &quot;three brand new presets&quot; written in the comments. I had not written such a thing at all, then I just restored my comments and resubmitted the pack. it was published properly then.<br />
<br />
so if no one listens to you, resubmit the pack.

		The DB does dome strange things. Alot of times the reviews can't access a pack because the DB says it's still being accessed by someone who logged out days ago.

		Something similar happened to me with my New Wave pack... It got mixed up with some other component. I nearly forgot about it, and now I'm republishing it... Thanks for reminding me!
