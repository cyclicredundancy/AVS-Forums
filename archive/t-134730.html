<div class="posttext">There is a strange bug with Fire AVS 2.<br />
It was published on 4th of May, but I didn't get the e-mail.<br />
There was no Staff Comment and it was rated 0 stars ALL.<br />
Also there is an error with picture.<br />
I commented my pack so anyone at Nullsoft may nitice this bug, I've sent a feedback with a cry for help, but it seems that nobody heared me.<br />
Forum is my last hope.<br />
<br />
NULLSOFT, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PACK? <br />
<br />
It's not about my browser, I've tested my pack's page in Netscape and Opera 7 - doesn't make it any better...<br />

<div class="posttext">well, happened to me too - monochrome pack wouldnt get published, so I went to edit my pack and what do i see, there was &quot;three brand new presets&quot; written in the comments. I had not written such a thing at all, then I just restored my comments and resubmitted the pack. it was published properly then.<br />
<br />
so if no one listens to you, resubmit the pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The DB does dome strange things. Alot of times the reviews can't access a pack because the DB says it's still being accessed by someone who logged out days ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Something similar happened to me with my New Wave pack... It got mixed up with some other component. I nearly forgot about it, and now I'm republishing it... Thanks for reminding me!</div></div><hr />
