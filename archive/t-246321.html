Fractals are pretty simple you just have to sit down and code the iterative loop (I would use evallib to nicen the loop coding). I dont personally think they make very good presets though, since the end result is basically a picture. They are, however, a pretty good way to do something technical that shows you can code... not that I care about that sort of thing or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) it lets you run the same piece of code over and over:<br />
<br />
// a slow way to set a to 1000<br />
a=0;<br />
loop(1000,assign(a,a+1));<br />
<br />
2) evallib is the programming language used for avs code<br />
<br />
3) http://tutorials.jheriko.kicks-ass.net/ nothing about evallib but some useful stuff for raytracing and 3d cameras</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">before you ask: eeltrans also known as avstrans is a .ape that<br />
makes coding much easier, especially if youre messing with (g)megabuf and loops.</div></div><hr />

a big question is to Jheriko. is it possible to use your gvm tool to create fractals? <br />
<br />
Well, if you want a static fractal you could generate an image and store it in the megabuf then use that to draw it.. it wouldnt be fast though.<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to approach the problem more logically I think. First find a fractal you wish to render. Secondly, find an algorithm or algorithms for generating it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most fractals come in one of three basic types as far as rendering is concerned (excuse my made up terms):<br />
<br />
Continuous: e.g. mandelbrot/julia fractals. These are potentially the most expensive to generate since you need to iterate per sample on some 1d/2d/3d line/grid/volume to work out the colour at that point.<br />
<br />
Constructive: e.g. dragon curve, pythagoras tree. These are probably the easiest and cheapest to render since they are simply collections of lines/triangles where each iteration adds more lines/triangles to the shape, but doesnt change the existing ones<br />
<br />
Subdividing: e.g. Koch snowflake. The Koch snowflake can be constructive if we use triangles, but if we want to find the border curve we must take 3 lines to start with (triangle edges) and replace each line with 4 new lines per iteration. Since we have to throw away the old geometry for each iteration these fractals are slightly more expensive than the simpler, constructive sort.<br />
<br />
If your fractal is continuous I would recommend going and finding something else, unless you notice a convienient hack (see the varying DM julia set presets). <br />
<br />
The constructive sort are quite easy to render as long as you understand the algorithm involved, you typically just need to create a superscope/triangle renderer which mimicks the algorithm for drawing the fractal.<br />
<br />
The subdividing sort are a bit more complicated, and you would invariably need to use megabuf to get a reasonable iteration count.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately though, you want to learn how to render points, lines and triangles before attempting anything this complicated :P<br />
<br />
Hope this helped...</div></div><hr />
