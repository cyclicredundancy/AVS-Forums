<br />
<div class="posttext">I look at code after code of avs superscopes.  So many numbers, letters, just about everything you can think of.  But it is another language to me.  So i have some questions and maybe you all can help me out.  Firstly, what do these letters mean:?<br />
<br />
n, r, t, p, b, s, c and d ?  they are the most commonly used letters in superscopes, so they must all mean something.  Are there words that they are short for?<br />
<br />
Next, what happens when you combine letters?  Like rdx, rdy, and rdz in 3d superscopes, bt and sc in regular ones (just some examples, the possibilirties are probably endless for this one.<br />
<br />
And finally, i read, i think it was unconed who wrote it but i dont remeber, wrote about how trigonometry has to do with this all, but after consulting the math textbook, it makes no sense as to why sin, cos, and tan have any affect on anything to me?<br />
<br />
I know this is alot of info to cover in one message, so spread it out.  People who know what tey are talking about, write about 1 topic every now and again and maybe everyone else can start to understand what this is all about.<br />
<br />
(P.S. if you ask me, maybe you should start up a newsletter at winamp that people could subscribe to about avs, and evrey month or week, a new topic could be discussed, like a school lesson almost on AVS.  That would be a big help, so consider it...)<br />
<br />
THanks.<br />

<div class="posttext">n -&gt; Number of pixels, do you know what &quot;pixels&quot; are ?<br />
r -&gt; Radius<br />
t-&gt; its not a default var. its just used to make movements. you may use &quot;stew&quot; instead of &quot;t&quot;.<br />
p -&gt; I think its just another var, :confused:<br />
b -&gt; either.!<br />
s -&gt; eiher.! :)<br />
c -&gt; eiher.! :)<br />
d -&gt; Distance.<br />
w -&gt;widht<br />
h -&gt; height<br />
<br />
the default vars, that cannot be changed are &quot; D&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;H&quot; &quot;N&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are there words that they are short for? WHAT ??? :confused:  I dont understand your question.<br />
<br />
That letters combination its not a right value they can be anything!<br />
you can creat your hown vars. <br />
eg -&gt; INIT: n=100; stew=0.5; var1=1; sinx=0.5; cosy=-1;<br />
<br />
to understand more abut 3D you got to know a little bit of geometry.<br />
If you really found that &quot;trigonometry help&quot; used and publish it.<br />
<br />
if you found it mail me please -&gt; heliobt@oninet.pt<br />
<br />
And all &quot;that&quot; expression make sense, believe me ! :)<br />

<div class="posttext">It's information that a lot of people could use. Not only the definitions but also plain English examples, syntax and usage (I'm not asking alot am I?) :)<br />
<br />
If someone could find the time to do this then I'm sure that a hell of a lot of people would appreciate it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">&quot;b&quot; is actually a pre-defined variable.  b = 1 when there is a beat and 0 when there isn't.<br />
<br />
Also, you can't just type &quot;sinx&quot;, it has to be &quot;sin(x)&quot;.  Otherwise, it won't work since Winamp reads &quot;sinx&quot; as one variable named &quot;sinx&quot;.<br />
<br />
Remember, you CAN change the variable n, but it has a meaning.  &quot;n&quot; is only pre-defined in superscopes, not movements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I understand that strining together DSX and DSY is just a nameing of a variable that is gonna be defined, but why does it appear in so many different creators code?  is it just a standard for avs that people just have an easy time understanding?  thats all from stew!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's what the predefined variables stand for:<br />
<br />
n - Number of points drawn every frame.<br />
v - Volume of point &quot;i&quot; on the spectrum/waveform. Goes from -1 to 1.<br />
i - Point on the waveform, goes from 0 to 1.<br />
x - Horizontal coordinates. -1 on the far left, +1 on the far right.<br />
y - Vertical coordinates. -1 at the top, +1 at the bottom.<br />
d - Distance from centre (used in polar equations).<br />
r - Rotation around the centre point (also used in polar equations).<br />
b - Beat. Whenever there's a beat, this changes from 0 to 1.<br />
w - Width of the window in pixels.<br />
h - Height of the window in pixels.<br />
red - Red value, from 0 to 1. (RGB).<br />
green - Green value, from 0 to 1. (RGB).<br />
blue - Blue value, from 0 to 1. (RGB).<br />
<br />
Did I miss any out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So, that makes me finally ask :<br />
<br />
What variables can I use, meaning which are save to use. Can I run into problems when I use something like &quot;xtz&quot; or &quot;bsin2&quot; as a variable, because the parser doesn't get that it is a variable?<br />
I think I had some problems with that in some presets.<br />
<br />
And if you like, check out Superscopes doing fractals and tell me if you like it (or not). I just tried if it was possible. There are some deactivated fractals in it, some don't work, some do...</div></div><hr />
