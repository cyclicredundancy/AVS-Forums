      Hey, ive been looking for a WMP visualizations preset for a while and couldn't find. Please link me if possible :)<br />
      <br />
      P.S<br />
      I know it isn't the right forum, but still I don't want to open two topics... If you guys can link me to a WMP 10/11 skin? :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not only that but you gave the wrong information for ANYONE to be able to help you. You forgot to mention the name, appearance etc.. of the vis you are looking for... who is going to help you?<br />
      <br />
      God maybe?<br />
      <br />
      Congratulations. This has to be the most failed post I have seen in my entire life.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: someone should lock this or delete it it whatever... I predict a long thread of people being generally offensive.</p>
