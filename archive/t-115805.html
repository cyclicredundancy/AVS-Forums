<div class="posttext">Dude, if you didn't get a 5-star review for PD3 you sure as fucking hell deserved one.  The current AVS reviewers are cocksuckers - they gave Zeven like 3 stars because they forgot to restart AVS so that the APEs (that they should have had already) would initialize.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You could always offer sexual services to the reviewers...just kidding, PD3 really deserves 5 stars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th November 2002, 23:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I agree, PD3 was worth at least 6 stars. I commented with 5 stars trying to help but, I dunno if it worked. I've messaged RovaStar about the reviewers, and he says he'll look into it, and that atm it's not possible to change the review.<br />
<br />
Go here if ya wanna help fsk. (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml;$sessionid$4RKTNE2YVDZV5TN241HBCZY?componentId=124721)<br />
<br />
<br />
On a lighter note:<br />
Is this really (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml;$sessionid$4RKTNE2YVDZV5TN241HBCZY?componentId=124764)<br />
better than this? (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml;$sessionid$4RKTNE2YVDZV5TN241HBCZY?componentId=124583)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's what I posted :)<br />
<br />
To those that think nagging about half a star is idiotic, it would indeed be idiotic if it weren't for the fact that the reviews on this website suck. Zevensoft's great pack lost a huge amount of points because the reviewer forgot to restart AVS, while Mohammad's 3rd 'professional' pack gets 2.5 stars for something I wouldn't even wipe my ass with.<br />
Yes, this comment contains harsh language and I don't mind because it accurately represents my feelings at this point. The reviewers need to realize that it's frickin HARD to make something with AVS that *doesn't* look 'cool' in one way or another. The only difference is that some people spend 2 minutes on a preset and publish it, and other people spend a whole week on it. To be able to recognize the difference is the least I would expect from the people who decide whether something gets 20 or 20000 downloads.<br />
And trust me there's nothing more disappointing than seeing something you spent weeks perfecting, getting flushed down the drain and supressed by crappy packs and Wildtangent trash. Realize that when you give something 0-1 stars, you're lowering its score immensely: all quality packs have at least 4.5 stars, so if you lower it by even 0.5 points, you're reducing its rank by at least 20 items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:)  Thanks people you made me feel a lot better. After all your opinion is all that counts. Not some dumbass reviewers who haven't made a single preset in their life:D.  And if the download rate didn't depend so much on that stupid staff rating I realy wouldn't care what they wrote:hang: . <br />
<br />
Thank you again I REALLY apreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I feel it must be said that regarding Zen's pack none of the forum review team reviewed it. (or at least admitted to it. :) )<br />
<br />
That coupled with the fact that teh database is crap and often gets.....confused and the fact that winamp staff reviews packs as well it is often out of our control.<br />
<br />
When things are obviously wrong like Zen's pack then we will look into it and corrections will be made.<br />
<br />
We have discussed from day one what rough a x star pack is and often I feel that the mark given are not that far away.<br />
<br />
Other plugins on the other hand we have no control over and soem of tehm seem to get massive marks for next to nothing. *cough* WildTangent *cough* Thus making the injustice worse.<br />
<br />
I persoanlly think that a 5 star pack should be very difficult to obtain. I will only award it for extremely good pack and maybe then only a couple a year.<br />
<br />
I have not download/seen the pack in question on this thread but we have 3 area to award on (overall is worked out by itself) and it got 4.5, 4.5 and 5. Not really all that bad really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Seen it now top pack. :):D<br />
<br />
I would have given it 5 stars for teh pack personally.<br />
<br />
Very nice work!</div></div><hr />
