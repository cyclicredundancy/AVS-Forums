<div class="posttext">heres a few thoughts on the AVS wishlist<br />
<br />
=====new effects<br />
<br />
my first contribution to the wishlist would be an expression evaluator to work with bitmaps/ movies.<br />
<br />
ideally it could cache a still image larger than the screen, or even a panoramic (cylindrical/ cube map) image, and allow the view to move around under script control like dynamic move etc. it would also be nice to control a movie with a script, for instance varying playback speed based on getspec() or getosc(). very ideally it would deal with vector images (flash movies) as well...<br />
<br />
and a more intuitive colour altering model like HSV...<br />
<br />
=====programming interface<br />
<br />
another big plus would be to open up to the .ape interface more of the features which are accessible to the built in plugins- such as access to buffers, render mode/line width etc.<br />
<br />
=====UI enhancements<br />
<br />
another thing which would probably not be that hard would be to have preset sizes for the output window. how much time have we all wasted trying to set that window to **exactly** 320x240 or whatever?<br />
<br />
and it would be great to have the avs editor window resizeable even if just to expand the space available for the effect list.<br />
<br />
a (probably more difficult) UI enhancement would be if the configuration screens for each effect could be torn off as a seperate window...<br />
<br />
and my ultimate wish would be a more flexible/powerful UI like MAX/MSP or jMAX... modular media processing using a 2D flowchart paradigm rather than a 1D stack paradigm...a<br />
<br />
i'll stop before i get carried away. T.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">one other thing which i don't think anyone else has mentioned...<br />
<br />
EVERY module needs to have an enable/disable button! especially dynamics modules!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmmm... none of my APE's have that :). I just see a lot of presets that have disabled or useless things in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeh i know that most of you guys use AVS exlusively through presets... you develop them, publish and distribute, and ultimately enjoy them as authored....<br />
<br />
but theres more than 1 way to use AVS. I use it for live performances with 1 large preset, containing all the effects i'm going to use, which evolves during the performance as i change settings and orders. i always have a spare disabled effect list to hold modules that can't be turned off. but it would be very handy to just be able to turn them off individually.<br />
<br />
and i think it would be very handy for preset developers to very easily see what effect a module is having by being able to easily toggle it on and off.<br />
<br />
its even in the .ape example on wadn...<br />

<div class="posttext">actually, i think you have gotten steven to get bit challenged to make a ape that could access buffers :)<br />
which not even i think is impossible.;)</div></div><hr />
