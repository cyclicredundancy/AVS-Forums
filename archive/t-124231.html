<div class="posttext">hahahahhahaha<br />
i know what you think about posting when drunk while i am! But! Despite of that, im still going to post this! hhaahahahah! because i don't care what you trhink WHILE im posting this new thread, so it's quite easy for me to do this without feelin quilty about it :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, i just wanted to ask: Does anyonme have anuy expriences with RADEON graphichs cards with avs? I mean, im going to buy (most likely) a radeon gfx card in the near future (after 3-5 months) and i just want to know has anyone had any problems with RADEON 9000 PRO, RADEON 8500 LE or RADEON 9700 PRO graphics cards while viewing avs?<br />
<br />
Now i know avs shouldn't be the main concer when buing a new gfx card, but since currently avs covers about  60% of my cpu usage i think i should consider whether or not avs runs smoothy&amp;whit npo problems while viewing avs.<br />
<br />
So if anyone has any opinions/experience/techcical statements about ATI's RADEON gfx cards, speak up NOW! before it's too late!<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW. BITMAPPED II: 3 presets ready to rock and roll!<br />
&quot;CODENAME ZERO&quot;: 6 presets readu to rock and fuck up your eyes palls!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well first off graphics card doesn't make any difference with smoothness of AVS(except for a small amount for buffers, etc.).  But AVS does run fine on ATI Radeon cards and the overlay mode works well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I haven't had problems with my 9700 (the light demo looks just sick :D ), or my rage mobility. A while ago there were a couple of people having issues with ATI cards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Newest drivers should fix the problems.  Worked for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, i know gfx crad doesn't affect anyway in avs, but after reading a couple threads about some people having problems with overlay modes, fullscreen modes etc. i thought i would ask if someone had any serious problems while using avs and having a radeon installed :)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, im pretty sure i'll buy a RADEON 9500 PRO, because im a student and im poor :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">radeon is quite good actually jukka!<br />
<br />
Go and buy it then =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Not to mention that you can mod your 9500 to be faster than a stock 9700. :) (if you're very good at soldering (sp?))</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Can U do the same with my *GeForce 4MX 440*?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I want an NV30/GeForce FX... whatever... or an R300 (aka Radeon 9900):)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th February 2003, 04:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The NV30 doesn't perform that much better than the 9700. I was surprised when I saw the benchmarks for it. That and it takes up two card slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Its not so much the raw power of the thing as much as it is the multitude of features. Who can deny the awesome, yet pointless, power of 128-bit color?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th February 2003, 18:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Mmm 128-bit color :). *drooool*<br />
<br />
24-bit is not enough though... some color arrangements still form bands at 24-bit. The problem is not that the eye can see more than 16777216 colors (it can't), but that the distribution of shades among those 16 million is not equal, and a lot is wasted on dark tones.<br />
<br />
Plus if you want to do color calculations, you need more than 24-bit so you avoid roundoff errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th February 2003, 21:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, plus the human eye will pick up more bands in different colors.  The human eye is very sensitive to green, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">legohead</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th February 2003, 21:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">128 will be good for me - Graphic design in print media needs ICM colour correction to match the monitor colours to the printer output colours (CMYK). I don't think there's 128bit support yet.<br />
<br />
By the way Jheriko - nice Red Dwarf quote back there! Fk I used to love that show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure the 9700 could do it too. It's got the floating point architecture too. They just didn't see the point. :p<br />
<br />
AVS would slow down sooo much.<br />
<br />
Ace Rimmer was the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2003, 14:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The human eye is very sensitive to green, for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
So that's why i hate so much green or have mucho trouble to decide what shade of green to use, take example my preset &quot;Microscope View&quot; i think i wasted about 2 hours to get the green look like i wanted :p</div></div><hr />
