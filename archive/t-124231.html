			<strong>Another drunk thread! TOPIC: RADEON&amp;AVS</strong><br />
		
		

		hahahahhahaha<br />
i know what you think about posting when drunk while i am! But! Despite of that, im still going to post this! hhaahahahah! because i don't care what you trhink WHILE im posting this new thread, so it's quite easy for me to do this without feelin quilty about it :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, i just wanted to ask: Does anyonme have anuy expriences with RADEON graphichs cards with avs? I mean, im going to buy (most likely) a radeon gfx card in the near future (after 3-5 months) and i just want to know has anyone had any problems with RADEON 9000 PRO, RADEON 8500 LE or RADEON 9700 PRO graphics cards while viewing avs?<br />
<br />
Now i know avs shouldn't be the main concer when buing a new gfx card, but since currently avs covers about  60% of my cpu usage i think i should consider whether or not avs runs smoothy&amp;whit npo problems while viewing avs.<br />
<br />
So if anyone has any opinions/experience/techcical statements about ATI's RADEON gfx cards, speak up NOW! before it's too late!<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW. BITMAPPED II: 3 presets ready to rock and roll!<br />
&quot;CODENAME ZERO&quot;: 6 presets readu to rock and fuck up your eyes palls!

		Well first off graphics card doesn't make any difference with smoothness of AVS(except for a small amount for buffers, etc.).  But AVS does run fine on ATI Radeon cards and the overlay mode works well.

		I haven't had problems with my 9700 (the light demo looks just sick :D ), or my rage mobility. A while ago there were a couple of people having issues with ATI cards.

		Yeah, i know gfx crad doesn't affect anyway in avs, but after reading a couple threads about some people having problems with overlay modes, fullscreen modes etc. i thought i would ask if someone had any serious problems while using avs and having a radeon installed :)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, im pretty sure i'll buy a RADEON 9500 PRO, because im a student and im poor :(

		Not to mention that you can mod your 9500 to be faster than a stock 9700. :) (if you're very good at soldering (sp?))

		The NV30 doesn't perform that much better than the 9700. I was surprised when I saw the benchmarks for it. That and it takes up two card slots.

		Its not so much the raw power of the thing as much as it is the multitude of features. Who can deny the awesome, yet pointless, power of 128-bit color?

		Mmm 128-bit color :). *drooool*<br />
<br />
24-bit is not enough though... some color arrangements still form bands at 24-bit. The problem is not that the eye can see more than 16777216 colors (it can't), but that the distribution of shades among those 16 million is not equal, and a lot is wasted on dark tones.<br />
<br />
Plus if you want to do color calculations, you need more than 24-bit so you avoid roundoff errors.

		Yeah, plus the human eye will pick up more bands in different colors.  The human eye is very sensitive to green, for example.

		128 will be good for me - Graphic design in print media needs ICM colour correction to match the monitor colours to the printer output colours (CMYK). I don't think there's 128bit support yet.<br />
<br />
By the way Jheriko - nice Red Dwarf quote back there! Fk I used to love that show.

		I'm pretty sure the 9700 could do it too. It's got the floating point architecture too. They just didn't see the point. :p<br />
<br />
AVS would slow down sooo much.<br />
<br />
Ace Rimmer was the best.

So that's why i hate so much green or have mucho trouble to decide what shade of green to use, take example my preset &quot;Microscope View&quot; i think i wasted about 2 hours to get the green look like i wanted :p
