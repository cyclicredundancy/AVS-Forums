      <p class="post-content"><strong>OT: correct word for ...</strong><br />
      I know it is a no-no to post offtopic, but I need the help of the maths talents here.<br />
      It's a short question.<br />
      An exponetial function (a^x) grows exponentially.<br />
      What's the adverb that describes how a function of a power (x^n) grows?<br />
      That's it.<br />
      Please don't delete this thread, I wouldn't know another place to ask this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">@the lobotomized guy: Found that on a math site too, but it sounds strange.<br />
      'This function grows polynominally.'<br />

      <p class="post-content">piR:<br />
      n=2: quadratically<br />
      n=3: cubically<br />
      etc...<br />
      the generic term for these is "polynomially" (without the n!)<br />
      comes from the noun "polynomial" (dt. Polynom) obviously ^^ why does it sound so strange to you? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">A polynom is something made of several other things.<br />
      Poly!<br />
      A polynom is e.g.: x&#194;&#179;-4x&#194;&#178;+x<br />
      But let's say x^6 is just a power term of sixth order.<br />
      I know the terms for x&#194;&#178;, x&#194;&#179; etc.<br />
      But I was hoping there was a generic term for x^n.</p>

      <p class="post-content">'Polynomial', not 'polynom' ;).<br />
      <br />
      By the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says x^n is a monomial.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Geometric or Polynomial.<br />
      <br />
      It is still technically a polynomial, just one where all coefficients n-1 to 0 are zero.<br />
      <br />
      x^6 = x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 0</p>

      <p class="post-content">Monomial sounds good.<br />
      Well from now on I'll use 'monomially'.<br />
      'x&#194;&#179; is a function that grows monomially.'<br />
      Still strange, but it seems to be the best fitting word.</p>

      So, in the future I will try to avoid sentences like 'This function grows ...ly.'.<br />

      <br />
      "o hay! there is only one term, so we dont need to call it poly anymore! monomial it is then!!"<br />

      <p class="post-content">Cool idea with the ascii art but could be more smooth! Try doing like this in the effect list:<br />
      b=if(above(b,5),0,b+1);<br />
      beat=equal(b,0);<br />
      enabled=1;<br />
      <br />
      and remove custom bpm and set movement to y=-2 in the frame event. Also using the terminal font gives a more stable frame rate (e.g. not true type).</p>

      </blockquote>thats what polynomial is foo, like someone else said for specifics you use the actual polynomial name.. for instance here are some names and the correlating largest terms<br />
      <br />
      x^5 = quinticly<br />
      x^12 = dodecicly<br />
      x^73 = heptacontatricly<br />
      x^100 = hecticly<br />
      <br />
      there is prolly a list out there somewhere, you can form the names from the greek roots if you know them.. i don't know them all.. hence my odd example of 73 in the middle there :P<br />
      <br />
      however, geometric growth is another specific type of polynomial growth, the sort with only terms in one power.. eg f(x) = x^n<br />
      where as f(x) = x^n+x^(n-r) is polynomial order n. think about a geometric progression to see where that comes from, the analog of this is arithmeticly.. but no one ever says there function value is growing arithmeticly, cos linearly is a much cooler word...<br />
      <br />
      the only time i've ever heard polynomial used in this context really is in the phrase 'polynomial time'
