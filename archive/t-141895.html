SSC is Super Scope<br />
MP is Moving Particle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What you have there is a hydrogen atom.  It contains 2 electrons, but are not moving nearly as fast enough as they are supposed to be.  Electrons move so fast that they develop a cloud; the electron cloud.  Electrons are always yellowish-white - never any different color, like blue.  There is no nucleus - which means also no protons or neutrons.  <br />
<br />
If you want to see a atom preset, check out that one that Ozgur Zeyhan made.  I don't remeber which pack it was, but I remember it being a really sweet preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where to start with picking apart this statement of wrongs?<br />
<br />
Hydrogen atoms only contain two electrons when ionized and normally contain one<br />
<br />
Because something moves fast it doesn't make it into a cloud, a cloud is a fairly densely packed volume of particles.<br />
Electrons are not always yellowish-white they can infact vary in color as they move and change energy states when they will emit different energy photons and therefore will 'change colour' for small periods of time.<br />
<br />
Does it matter how theoretically accurate an atom preset is? No. What matters is how good it looks.<br />
<br />
P.S. I hate Ozgur Zeyhan</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Could be the start of a good preset, but it's too simple for now, at least in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Ah, crap.  Gimme a break man!  I'm only in tenth grade. :rolleyes: That's all I got. <br />
<br />
P.S. What is wrong with Ozgur?  Did he rip you or something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I also personally did'nt like Ozgur's presets, they were too repetitive, he had a bad choice of colours and moreover he used the same DM again and again after modifying just a little.<br />
<br />
That was my opinion on Ozgur's presets(some of them nice but onlysome) :roll eyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may have gone a bit overboard... it just riles me up when people talk about things as if they know lots about them when they blatantly don't *cough*Atero*cough*.<br />
<br />
Ozgur, I sent him an email once suggesting that his installer should not take control of my computer and make it do things i didn't want and also suggesting that he should put his avs presets into the avs preset category on devart instead of the winamp3 skins section. he sent be back a really insulting email, his justification for putting avs packs in the wrong place was that it gave him more downloads, the whole email in fact gave the impression that all he cared about was the number of downloads, he used the logic of 'i have more downloads on winamp.com therefore i am much better at avs than you and know more than you about everything'. The other thing about Ozgur is his mix of speeder 3k and zero-g maze II, if i were UnConeD i would remove the '(If you wish to use any part of this preset in your own packs you are free to do so, on the condition that you include my contact information)' from the preset comments on the basis of that single preset. Since when can an X-wing fly sideways or even backwards?</div></div><hr />
