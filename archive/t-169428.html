		Hah this is indeed really nice. My first though was &quot;wicked scope coding, what formula is that?&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like is that due to the white in the colormap, it gets kind of pale when it fades out. Also, it seems to take quite a bit to make it respond. What good is a voolintarnz daye preset if it doesn't look sweet on mushy, romantic songs?<br />
<br />
I tried playing around with a convo glow, but it's hard to prevent that 'red light district' glow which sort of ruins the feel of the preset for obvious reasons ;).

		well then you should normalize your mp3s.  this preset works on a dB approximation, so if your mp3s aren't mixed properly then it won't respond that well.<br />
<br />
and yea i can't think of a way to make this respond immediately...unless i was actually going to make scopes that did the same thing.  needless to say, that'd be a fucking pain in the ass ;)<br />
<br />
i wasn't trying to make a valentine's day preset btw, it was just the fact that this was the only cmap that &quot;worked&quot; with this preset, and it was all pink and crap, and all day i'd been thinking about valentine's day (specifically how useless a holiday it is - i mean fuck, it doesn't get me a day off school, what good is it?)...and how i don't have a girlfriend...;(
