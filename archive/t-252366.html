      <p class="post-content"><strong>two viz questions</strong><br />
      first, whenever a new song starts the viz'er starts, i have no clue why. i _do not_ want this to be normal behavior.<br />
      edit: nevermind, `visplugin_autoexec=0' :)<br />
      <br />
      second, is there a way i can make full screen of the viz (or even video) show up on my second monitor only? or is there a way to make 320x240 stretch to fit the full screen without actually enabling full screen?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>Question 1</b><br />
      [edit]<br />
      Whoops, I had the wrong answer. Correct answer follows<br />
      <br />
      Winamp &gt; Ctrl+P &gt; Plug-ins &gt; uncheck "Auto execute visualization plug-in on playback"<br />
      <br />
      Your edit reflects the editing the Winamp.ini files. The above show the Winamp option<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Question 2</b><br />
      Are you using AVS (Advanced Visualization Studio)? AVS is not a multi/dual-monitor visualization. I have seen suggestions to swap the primary and secondary monitors in the video cards configuration. In other words<br />
      <br />
      MilkDrop does have dual monitor options. In the MilkDrop options, click on the 'common settings' tab then click the 'DualHead' button to see if you make the appropriate settings there.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i am using avs. i have tried switching displays, but i don't like that. maybe if i spend more time with config i'll be able to bring it back. meaning: my dock (along with start bar) moves to the second screen which is not what i want, also the monitors switch so i have to move my mouse to the opposite side to get to the opposite screen.<br />
      <br />
      also, i've never used milkdrop. i may do some research when i get home.<br />
      <br />
      i will try it when i get back and post results, any other suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think there is much else that can be done about AVS, as far as viewing fullscreen on secondary monitor is concerned.<br />
      <br />
      I will move this to the AVS Troubleshooting forums where you will more authoritative answers.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Note:</b> In the previous reply I misunderstood question one and give the incorrect answer. It was edited to reflect answer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">for fullscreen AVS on a second monitor set the resolution size of that screen to the desired resolution and the make your AVS window just a few pixels larger than this secondary screen and move it onto it.<br />
      for smaller resolutions [below 640x480] use AVS editor &gt; settings &gt; display &gt; pixel doubling.<br />
