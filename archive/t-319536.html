<div class="posttext">i don't think there's a way other than the website to get these, maybe there's a way to write a script or macro to automate the process.<br />
<br />
otherwise, these two links are a good start to get many packs.<br />

<div class="posttext">Nice packs! 180 megabytes of avs files... Must make all the inspiration i need :)<br />
I'm into something great with the very basic plugins and a few 3rd party... All i got left is to learn the coding esoterics!<br />
I wonder if it'd be worth it that the nullsoft team developp a downloader... Like the one made by stardock... Something in which it'd be faster to make a to-get list and finalize with &quot;press download to download your selection&quot;<br />
Getting all availliable files from skins to plugins etc... Test and toss.<br />
It'd be much simpler too as devs wouldnt have to provide installers anymore :)<br />
Could be based on the torrent system in a restricted way, letting users make the servers's tasks more light and less mbps costy for the website's owners... (base upon the server and feed with the peers)<br />
Edit:<br />
Virus in Threes.exe...<br />
All EXEs... <br />
Extracting 7zs, getting exes...<br />
I'm not done executing all packs since november.<br />
I whished too hard... I guess. Thought that the packs would all be ready - set - go.<br />
Whish that the DannyG pack will be less laxative!<br />
Edit:<br />
Woo! Zip files with avs files inside :D That makes my joy :D<br />
:S False allert... All exes again... :S<br />
Ah... Nope False false allert XD Avs files :)<br />
Arrigatto!<br />
Edit:<br />
Some very unserious stuff in the non-exe part of the DannyG pack :P<br />
Stick figueres with some superspeed text XD</div></div><hr />
