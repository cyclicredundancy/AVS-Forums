      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to download all 2100 avs presets packs in a click?</strong><br />
      I don't have the month to download every avs packs one by one... Has somebody released an iso containing all the public presets? (i used to have a lot of those but i won't ever start click clicking clickenning and clickerring clicks ever again)<br />
      Let me know if any .torrent file, ftp, nullsoft web section, or anything useful could make me get all 2100 presets packs in ONE click!! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i don't think there's a way other than the website to get these, maybe there's a way to write a script or macro to automate the process.<br />
      <br />
      otherwise, these two links are a good start to get many packs.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nice packs! 180 megabytes of avs files... Must make all the inspiration i need :)<br />
      I'm into something great with the very basic plugins and a few 3rd party... All i got left is to learn the coding esoterics!<br />
      I wonder if it'd be worth it that the nullsoft team developp a downloader... Like the one made by stardock... Something in which it'd be faster to make a to-get list and finalize with "press download to download your selection"<br />
      Getting all availliable files from skins to plugins etc... Test and toss.<br />
      It'd be much simpler too as devs wouldnt have to provide installers anymore :)<br />
      Could be based on the torrent system in a restricted way, letting users make the servers's tasks more light and less mbps costy for the website's owners... (base upon the server and feed with the peers)<br />
      Edit:<br />
      Virus in Threes.exe...<br />
      All EXEs...<br />
      Extracting 7zs, getting exes...<br />
      I'm not done executing all packs since november.<br />
      I whished too hard... I guess. Thought that the packs would all be ready - set - go.<br />
      Whish that the DannyG pack will be less laxative!<br />
      Edit:<br />
      Woo! Zip files with avs files inside :D That makes my joy :D<br />
      :S False allert... All exes again... :S<br />
      Ah... Nope False false allert XD Avs files :)<br />
      Arrigatto!<br />
      Edit:<br />
      Some very unserious stuff in the non-exe part of the DannyG pack :P<br />
      Stick figueres with some superspeed text XD</p>
