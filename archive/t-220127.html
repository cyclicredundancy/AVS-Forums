      hi,<br />
      <br />
      i wasn't sure where to post this so i took a wild stab in the dark and went for this forum in the hope that it wouldn't annoy people for being in the wrong place :)<br />
      <br />
      im just wondering about other peoples opinion. you see i made a lil preset collection, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=145300" target="_blank">ped</a> . and im thinking about following it up, maybe not so much with particle engines (you can have endless fun with them, but it gets tiresome ;)). but definatly with more 'tecnical' presets :).<br />
      <br />
      and here within lies the dilemma. i could either go for a more tecnical direction and make a pack of 'demos' that show off varied effects (like strings and flocking systems and stuff). tecnical stuff is great but it never looks all that interesting.<br />
      <br />
      or i could go in the more movie-esque feel, where tecnical subjects are used but ultimatly designed to be a visulisation.<br />
      <br />
      of course there is the third option of 'go home, your presets suck!' ;)<br />
      <br />
      -<br />
      so yea, im just wondering what peoples think :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Imho, I think you proved yourself on the technical side with PED. You are right, it's great to do 'demos' that showcase certain avs capabilities, but they are rather uninteresting. I say use that tech stuff to make some really cool presets. Er... 'movie-esque', if you like.;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I checked your pack when it first came out, and my main reaction was that there was no real music visualisation in the presets (other than the intro which was probably the best preset). If they were tech demo's it wouldn't really be such a big concern but particle engines really don't consitute a tech demo by modern AVS standards, they are relatively simple.<br />
      <br />
      If you really think you can produce 'never before seen' effects then I suggest you go for it, but try to remember that every preset should try to have at least SOME music response in it (I'm sure people will reply to this now quoting various presets I've made with no music response, so I'm not trying to pretend its easy)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yea it didn't have much music interaction, i never liked that aspect of the presets, i never created [most] of them for other people to see, i just like to use avs to work on ideas i have, then a little while ago i decided to post them on winamp.com as they had been sitting on my hard-drive for months and months (some as long as a year i think).<br />
      <br />
      the code of the older presets was suffering from 'embarsing code that i can't remember how it worked' syndrome. so instead of hacking them up to make them work with music better i decided to leave it.<br />
      <br />
      but now id like to actually create something nice to look at :) something that isn't a lot of strange mutations of colours though.. don't get me wrong i love those kinda presets, but have no disernable ability to create them ;)</p>
