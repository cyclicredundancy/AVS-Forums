<div class="posttext">Hi everybody<br />
<br />
I couldn't find an avs preset like i wanted, so i decided to try and create it myself. It was much more difficult than i imagined, i had to spend lots of time studying, reading tutorials, searching the messages in this forum, etc. The final result is not as good as i had originally envisioned, but it's the best i could do at this time. <br />
<br />
I tried to match the colors to the Gold Rush color theme of the default Modern skin. I thought maybe some of you might like to see it, so here it is ...<br />
<br />
Any opinions, praise, criticism, or recommendations for improvements are welcome. :-)<br />

<div class="posttext">haha I like that one, looks nice!! especially when your song title is &quot;Are you mad?&quot; :D<br />
not the usual tunnel color flash thingy for a first preset...<br />
the speaker could use a little more response though [only a little]</div></div><hr />

Thanks. I agree about the &quot;speaker&quot;. It's supposed to represent the treble, midrange, and bass pitches, but it doesn't really look good. I was hoping for something more realistic, but that's beyond my abilities at this time.<br />

I have to admit i don't know how to make a realistic speaker, but i tried to improve the speaker in my avs. It's much better, i think, so here is the updated version. (correct avs name format this time)<br />
<br />
Any hints on possible improvements? Anyone want to tinker with it, you have my permission. :-)<br />
<br />
One idea i had originally was a metronome for the beats (i haven't seen a metronome in any presets). But i ditched that idea for the speaker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I liked the first version more...<br />
<br />
but anyway, here's my humble remix. it was so fun to play with the turntables! [I didn't clean up the code though, there are some flaws in it]<br />
I changed some little things like turning the background scope into a clear screen and remove the text effect list which is all faster.<br />
the screen height should be bigger than 300px<br />
<br />
GC</div></div><hr />

Hey, i like the turntables! But the flashing black screen is distracting to me, is it supposed to do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the remix. I'm sure i can learn from it. Learning is a slow process, but fun at the same time. :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">After reworking my first version, the speakers now look like speakers and respond like speakers. The solution was to use getosc() instead of getspec() data.<br />
<br />
Check this out!</div></div><hr />

no it's not :weird: <br />
try disabling the text renderer [it's buggy].<br />
<br />
the 3rd thing is better but I'd like the speakers more if they really moved [like in ver1] not just partially [dis-]appeared.<br />
but leave it, the difference is marginal...</div></div><hr />

Thanks. The last version had a small glitch, the treble and midrange speakers were responding the same. That's been fixed, also i changed the background to a more eye-pleasing golden color. Included in this attachment is a version with colors reversed. Both look awesome now, but i can't decide which one i like best. :-)<br />
<br />
Until i learn quite a bit more, this should be the final update.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I discovered that the speakers look much better if the outside rings don't disappear. I'll post an update if anyone wants it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmph it looks like you made some more but heres a remix of the first version you might get a idea or two. also its yours to keep i don't want any credit for doing this i was just having fun with it enjoy.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't work properly for me. The top 1/3 of the screen is black, and the sliding text is just black and white squares.</div></div><hr />

The top 1/3 of the screen is black, and the sliding text is just black and white squares.  the squares are just superscopes to give the look of a tuner device. the top half of the preset was attempt at trying to keep your original design with out visualizing the dm on the bottom. sorry for the mess up also the vis has to be smallest square possible window size for the true reason for that scope. sorry you can remove it if you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just finished a major overhaul of my preset. I'm satisfied with it now, although the speakers would look much better in 3d. And i know absolutely nothing about 3d. Anyone willing to try a remix?<br />
<br />
I think it's unique and looks great to me. Anyway, here it is, check it out!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a small change in the oscilloscope. I always dont like the fast moving ones. Here's one that looks good, is more responsive and sometimes produces cool patterns (try a pure vocal or a violin). I had already made a preset of it, but hey, why not use it again :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's very nice, thanks. I tried to put 3 horizontal bars under the osscillicope that would display the treble, midrange, and bass getspec() data, but i couldn't do it. So i settled for the cone thingy, or whatever you want to call it. :-)<br />
<br />
Perhaps after i learn more, i can do better.</div></div><hr />

I spent more time watching your remix with different music, and you're right, very interesting patterns. I liked it so much, i made a new version with the cone thing removed, and your oscilloscope centered in the empty space. And i really like this version. Many Thanks.</div></div><hr />
