      This is a hard to explain!<br />
      These days there is a lot of choice in the "Most Recent" area. New AVS presets come and go all the time. And most of them are just 2-3 star work. I think Winamp's should separate these 2-3 star or less presets to their own "newbie" zone or whatever. Then everybody could find good packs from the pages and the not so good packs.<br />
      And if this doesnt work, the reviewers could take same kind of system like in Skins. The AVS pack is Approved or Not Approved. You know if it really sucks.<br />
      <br />
      I dont know if this was the thing i tried to explain but i tried at least.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Links to other Preset by Creator</strong><br />
      it also would be good, if ther are links to all other PresetPacks (better all Plug-ins and Skins) by any Creator, like its in the resource area</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah thats good!<br />
      It is very HARD to find other packs made by the same creator. They change the pack name every time they publish, so it is very hard to find the other packs.<br />
      Same kind of a "user profile" would be good in the PLUGIN area too. You could see some information about the AVS artist (where is he from, Other packs, Age, E-mail, Homepages and all the other stuff).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Skins aren't unapproved if they suck. We still publish them. They just suck. Besides, what's wrong with the "AVS Presets" section?</p>

      <p class="post-content">what i mean is, if i'm at the page to download as example my "GreatWhoPack1", there also are links to the pages for "GreatWhoPack2","GreatWhoPack3" and and and.<br />
      it's not that something is wrong with the "AVS Preset" Section, it's only an idea to navigate easy to other other Packs of one and the same creator... so maybe the users who surf on, would also go to download the other Packs, if he downloads one Pack and he think it's a great one, he's going to the others and download them also if they are at the last positon of the list. you know, there are thousends of Presets and who is throug the full list to find some Presets???<br />
      <br />
      Do you understand what i (and Antzas AVS too) mean ?</p>

      </blockquote>All skins are approved unless they are stolen, inappropriate, using a U.S. pro/college sports team logo, or have less than main, equalizer, and playlist skinned.
