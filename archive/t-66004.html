<div class="posttext">I have a question : Why is AVS so slow in the fullscreen mode ? I have a Athlon 1.4 and geforce2 mx400(64ram) with 256mb ram pc133. Or is this the same on every pc ? <br />

<div class="posttext">Yup.  AVS is slow in full screen.  It does not use hardware acceleration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">on full screen, don't use something like 800 by 600 or something <br />
<br />
I'm on a k6-2 500 with the same Graphics card as you except I have a pci with 32 meg :( but it works<br />
<br />
<br />
anyways I use 320@240 around that area you will get better avs</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1027x728 is not what Winamp uses, and for a good reason. Computers work best with numbers that are powers of 2. Which is why you get desktop resolution options like 640x480 (does anyone actually USE that?), 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1420 (or something like that) and 1200x1600</div></div><hr />

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I made a mistake : I ment 1024*768 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But it is still stupid because when winamp came out with that AVS thing there was no pc that could handle it ! :confused: <br />

<div class="posttext">I DO hope you will be able to run the AVS plug in at 1280x1420 or higher!<br />
<br />
:cool: :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The cool thing about AVS is that it can perform very complex effects that look good even on lower resolutions. Besides, for projecting onto big screens, AVS is perfect, because you don't get a great resolution there anyway.<br />
<br />
It's a choice... go for Milkdrop if you want smooth 1280x960 performance... but you won't get as much interesting effects as AVS.<br />
<br />
By the way, if no-one ever made a program that was runnable on the average PC, then you'd have missed out on some of the greatest pc stuff:<br />
 - The 7th Guest (this CD-ROM game made CD-ROM drive-sales skyrocket)<br />
 - Unreal (even though its software mode was slow and not many people had 3D cards, the quality of the graphics were definately Unreal at that time!)<br />
 - etc.<br />
<br />
Of course all the more recent PC freaks won't remember the days when new software was usually a revolution :)</div></div><hr />

True but Milkdrop is improving all time and now with a healthy preset scene. Stuff very different to the default presets.<br />

PC's they are those new business IBM computer things aren't they?!?<br />
Good old C64 those were the days.<br />
