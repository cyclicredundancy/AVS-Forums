      Ok, here's a few presents I just made. I like the way the background looks with the bump, I just can't get the friggin thing to quit blinking. It's going to give me epilepsy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">remove that entire effect list. it's not doing anything anyway.<br />
      <br />
      that huge difference in bump intensity between beat/no beat is annoying too</p>

      <p class="post-content">in my eyes that effect list is doing something though: it actually causes that flickering.<br />
      But you're right concerning the bump, it's annoying this way.<br />
      <br />
      hey micro_brain, could it be that there are some mistakes in your preset? Casue i'm wondering about that deactivated convolution filter. Also another hint: the misc/set render mode only effects render-objects placed directly behind them and inside the same effect-list!</p>
