      <p class="post-content">just cause stupid winxp has a stupid integrated zip tool...<br />
      <br />
      most presets give me headaches<br />
      amazingly s<b>ei</b>zureportal(++) doesnt ^^<br />
      <br />
      my advices:<br />
      more customized stuff (like the hand-written texer in "Interactive Craptivity")<br />
      less canned stuff<br />
      less flickering<br />
      also, your presets are not really optimized... if i spent some time on it i could maybe make them faster by a factor of 3-4 :P (denkensiefursich knows what i mean :D)<br />
      <br />
      there are some nice coding tutorials out there, like <a href="http://pak-9.deviantart.com" target="_blank">PAK-9</a>'s <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891" target="_blank">programming guide</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">btw: what about the shadows in lydsic? Are they too simple, either?<br />
      Weren't they made by a bunch of texerII's where every single spec-peak had a corresponding shadow-texerII? (=&gt;simple?) :confused:</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      Anyway, about these presets i agree with everyone else that they are a bit too seizure-tastic :igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">i really don't know what tomylobo meant. so i asked.<br />

      But anyway, i can also confirm that those presets are rather unpleasant.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, I quite liked a few of these. The blinking is a bit too much in most of the "acid" type presets (BTW, none of those really look like an acid trip. ;)) good movement, though. As I say, I like some of these, but everybody here will agree that I don't know shite. :D</p>
