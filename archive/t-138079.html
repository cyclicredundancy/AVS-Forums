      I think I may be missing something on how Overlay works.<br />
      It's been working fine for months, and now has stopped. When I enable it I can see the AVS but only on my icons?! Active desktop is OFF. Even with no background picture still sod all. If I set background and default colour to black it works, but then everything black including Winamp EQ and text on the start bar are flashing. Aggghhhh! Why has it just started this, and how do I stop it. Normally I need do nothing, just set overlay and it works, why this has started I have no idea.<br />
      <br />
      It's 2000Pro and a GF4Ti if that is of use.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I did a search and checked the FAQ but didn't find the answer.<br />
      :cry:<br />
      <br />
      Ignore, I sorted it. Tried to delete the thread but it wont let me.<br />
