<div class="posttext">wow! Pretty well done for a beginners work, imho! Assuming it's all your own code, i must say that you know how to handle the essential functions of the superscope. Also the colors aren't that bad.<br />
But try to avoid those black backgrounds. Sometimes they may be nice, but mostly it can be done better with some kind of colored background. (sorry but we see that a bit too often here, it's a typical 'beginners mistake').<br />
btw, like 'astral star' best.<br />
<br />
good progress!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">neat indeed. It shows that you've been AVS'ing a bit longer..<br />
Your website url gives me a 404 though</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm.. for me the website url works fine, but unfortunately i don't speak any French :(<br />
<br />
wotl are you using this one: http://furrtek.free.fr/ ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pretty nice for your first basic release. I like 'Astral Star' and 'Living Crystal' the best. But as WotL said, I receive a 404 as well for the website.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very nice colors indeed. Neon is great in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
I guess the 4 elements of AVS are color, shape, movement and texture. You seem to have the first one covered. I'm looking forward to seeing more of your work though.<br />
<br />
By the way, newbie convolution mistake #1: not using powers of two for the divider. This slows down the convolution a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks a lot for your advices =) Also, i didn't said that i'm just 16 and french, so please excuse me for my bad english, i'm not used to this kind of forum...<br />
Sorry also for the site, they said they are having problems with the servers and it will maybe be up again tonight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I was bored this afternoon so here are my last compos... When i finally finished them i saw they were mostly the same, so i'll keep the best (or the least worst ;) )<br />
<br />
My AVS page still doesn't work [@$%#!!!:mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice ones!<br />
<br />
Somehow i like 'Barcode', it's a funny idea! Though you could try to make the movement a bit smoother, it's too jagged to some extend imo.<br />
<br />
Besides the background scope in 'Timdru' is a heavy framerate killer, cause you're using way too much pixels (n sometimes is greater than 30,000 pixels!!) But you could achieve a very similar effect with trans/grain and a effectlist to vary the amount of 'graining'.<br />
<br />
Btw, nice to see much less of those plain 'black background presets'!<br />
<br />
Keep up your good work! :up:</div></div><hr />
