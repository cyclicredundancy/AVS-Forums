      hey,<br />
      <br />
      i don't know if i'm crazy or what, but i seem to remember an old version of winamp had a visualization that had a vertical ocilliscope moving horizonally back and forth across my screen, and the colors paited a picture of *i think* the Grinch. does anyone else remember this? did such a thing exist or was it all in my head? if it <i>did</i> exist, would it be possible to get it for the newest winamp?<br />
      <br />
      thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If it did, I'm pretty sure that it was not created with AVS.<br />
      Can you remember a part of the name? Then you can <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/" target="_blank">search</a> (top of the page) for it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can remember that the winamp 2 packed an avs where a vertical occilliscope moving horizonally back and forth, but it just faded out using a water effect, so it wouldn't paint the grinch, excespt for maybe a single audio track, and that would be coincedental.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways I installed the old winamp version and found that it was made by justin, and that it was dubbed "justin - quite nice"</p>

      <p class="post-content">never. WA5 is better than WA2 in almost every aspect, AVS-wise modern skins are slowing down WA, but if you're using classic skins, it's faster thanks to the newer version of AVS which has some great improvements.</p>
