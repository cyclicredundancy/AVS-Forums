<div class="posttext">hey,<br />
<br />
i don't know if i'm crazy or what, but i seem to remember an old version of winamp had a visualization that had a vertical ocilliscope moving horizonally back and forth across my screen, and the colors paited a picture of *i think* the Grinch. does anyone else remember this? did such a thing exist or was it all in my head? if it did exist, would it be possible to get it for the newest winamp?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If it did, I'm pretty sure that it was not created with AVS. <br />
Can you remember a part of the name? Then you can search (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/) (top of the page) for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can remember that the winamp 2 packed an avs where a vertical occilliscope moving horizonally back and forth, but it just faded out using a water effect, so it wouldn't paint the grinch, excespt for maybe a single audio track, and that would be coincedental.<br />
<br />
Anyways I installed the old winamp version and found that it was made by justin, and that it was dubbed &quot;justin - quite nice&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">never. WA5 is better than WA2 in almost every aspect, AVS-wise modern skins are slowing down WA, but if you're using classic skins, it's faster thanks to the newer version of AVS which has some great improvements.</div></div><hr />
