<br />
<div class="posttext">I frequently use the overlay mode to get the pretty lights to appear as your desktop background. For this i set the avs to &quot;randomly switch presets&quot; using the whole directory of them. the only problem is that when you set a time period for the presets to change, say 19 seconds, the avs will not display ALL the visualisations, it only cycles through a few of them in a loop, and doesn’t use them all.<br />
If you change the time interval for the &quot;randomly switch presets&quot; then you get a different loop of visualisations, but again not all of them are used.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else found this and is there any fix for this??<br />
<br />
What i want is for the avs to play all the presets, changing every 20 seconds say. (I’m not bothered about order, just that all of them are used)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help anyone can give me with this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In the same window where you can select the time interval,<br />
AVS editor &gt; Settings &gt; Presets/Hotkeys<br />
select the big button below Preset (sub) directory to use for random/cycle, then select 'All' (on top) instead of a certain path</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i am a fairly compitent winamp user, and this allready have this setup, the problem is that with this setup it still only cycles through a few (10-15 ish) of the visualisations.<br />
if you change the time delay, it then plays a different set of 10-15 ish visualisations.<br />
<br />
i think it must be something to do with the programs code for randomly selecting preset visualisations, but that sort of program understanding is well beyond me!<br />
<br />
if you try it yourself, you should/may see the problem i'm getting at.<br />
<br />
i suppose if it is a problem it will have to be sorted out by the winamp makers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No such bug here, using win2k &amp; winamp 5.091.<br />
<br />
Whatever the problem is it might be limited only to your system and there is no telling then what it is causing the problem. Unless someone else has the same problem i don't think anyone will try to fix it (even if AVS is open source now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm, i also don't have that bug. Im using winXP and winamp 5.092 but i also didn't have such a problem before. :confused:<br />
<br />
btw, just an idea: do you use the latest AVS? Cause some older versions weren't able to use sub-dirs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">right! but 'yourself' didn't say which version he is running! So... :igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">yourself</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2005, 21:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yea i'm runing version 2.81b,<br />
<br />
previous problem aside, is there any way you can get it to sequentialy change the visualisation, from 1 to 2 to 3 etc.<br />
<br />
because the random selection function doesnt exclude the visualisations already played, it selects randomly from all the visualisations every time it changes.<br />
<br />
i think this is the reason for me thinking that they are repeted, they are, but only because of the way the visualisations are selected.<br />
<br />
is there any way to change this, so that it randomly selects a viusualisation from the visualisations not already played since the last startup of winamp??<br />
<br />
if not is anyone out there clever enough to wright it into an AVS 2.81c ??<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If your really desperate to control the flow of presets use an app like hotlist or similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry, but there's only the 'randomly switch presets every x seconds' feature. If you want to browse through your presets sequentially you can use the keys u and y to go one preset for or back.<br />
<br />
I dont know if it's much work to do, but i guess there is a way to add a 'sequentially switch presets' to avs. But since AVS has just become open source and the interested people are just about to organize a group at sourceforge i doubt it will be added soon. (apart from the fact that most people want to get done other things...).<br />
<br />
Talking about 'preset-switching', that reminds me of a tool goebish made some time ago. Someone asked if it'd be possible to switch presets automatically when a new song starts.  Perhaps it's worth a try... You'll find that thread here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=204844) and the tool can be dl'ed here.

<div class="posttext">My general purpose plugin only send a ID_VIS_RANDOM message to avs window, so I think this willl cause the exact same problem. But give it a try as you can still use next/previous mode...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry, didn't actually had in mind how it worked. But that bug 'yourself' has, really makes me wonder! :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I run recent Winamp and AVS, and I use Windows ME (CRAP!) and I have never had that problem. Even on fullscreen overlay, it will cycle through all of the presets. Sorry, yourself; I know what it's like to have a bug that nobody else can see!<br />
<br />
Although when I run AVS overlay as a 'screensaver' (no music) it will eventually freeze up the system to where I have to reboot. If anyone knows what that's all about, I would appreciate being enlightened. However I suspect it's a OS issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th June 2005, 22:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah i also guess that those lock-ups are an OS problem. Cause sometimes i also use fullscreen avs as my screensaver. But it never crashed here, though i also let it run for hours!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">cheers for the goebish idea, and others so far guys,<br />
<br />
i guess that what i realy want is what &quot; ^..^ &quot; says, a sequential preset change, so that all the presets get used and arn't repeated untill they've all been used once (what can i say, i'm a perfectionist)<br />
<br />
like i say, this is well beyond my skills !! but maybe if i bring the matter up at sourceforge, someone will sort something out for me and the wider community !<br />
<br />
i wonder how many other people out their are wondering about the same thing i am??? one things for sure tho, there's no quick fix !!</div></div><hr />

well, seems as if you're the only one, since no one else discovered the same problem you have! :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, you really could try to ask someone at sourceforge, perhaps they know an answer?!</div></div><hr />
