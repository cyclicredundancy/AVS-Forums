<div class="posttext">Something that benchmarks your computer on AVS capabilities would be great, so we can know what the average is and build our packs on it. There are multiple ways to do this.<br />
<br />
1. combining some earlier made presets with various heavy effects in it, and counting up (or whatever) the reached FPS.<br />
<br />
2. just posting our CPU's and somehow use that.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to do no. 1. Some people who want to help me with this?<br />
<br />
The reason for posting this is that I bought a new computer (AMD 2600+) about 3 months ago, and AVS is really fast now. I know lots of people don't have a proc which runs over 1.8 gHz or whatever. So I want to build my packs according to the average speed. I now count on my own computer for avs's to run at least with 20 fps, and render priority on lowest.<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">How about we just make one singlke preset, with a non varying fps. And post it somewhere as the official benchmark preset.<br />
<br />
ie, &quot;you should get at least 25 fps running this preset&quot; or somesuch. For benchmarking purposes, its very important that you dont have much else running also. <br />
<br />
for the record: im runnng amd athl 1700+ 1.4gHz w/ 256. <br />
I run avs at 400x300, sometimes less for editng. No pixel doubling or retrace.<br />
<br />
/edit and i cant stand watching anything less than 25fps</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i ran avs on a shabby amd with 700mhz at 320x200. now i'm back on intel with 2.4ghz and i achieve about the same fps as before (even SLIGHTLY faster) in 480x360, page-flipping and retrace ON.<br />

<br />
although i like running presets between 20 and 30fps, i think it's getting bearable from 16fps on (i think either retrace or page flippong smooths avs up at low fps)<br />
<br />
btw: we had this before (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=133216&amp;highlight=benchmark)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There are some sliders in the display and fullscreen settings that can speed the ramerate up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so who would like to make the benchmark preset?<br />
<br />
for the record as well:<br />
AMD 2600+ with 1 GB RAM.<br />
running AVS at 400x340</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">sure what the hell...<br />
<br />
Intel Celeron 466mhz with 160 mb ram with AVS at 256*140<br />
<br />
AVS usually runs from 7 - 14 fps<br />
<br />
Edit: On windows XP, as different OS'es take up different amounts of resources</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice gd game :p<br />
<br />
P4 2.6G 512MB XP 400x300(overlay)<br />
<br />
I think the results so far show already that the differences are just too high to determine an average setting that would produce decent results on all comps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">WTF?<br />
<br />
Ok, i am about to upgrade my pc to Athlon64 3200+ next month. This will speed up my current avs which run at about 15fps on my AthlonXP 1800+ but my future presets will still run on 15 fps. Why? Because i tend to add as much effects as possible or increase the gridsize of DM's if i can get more out of my cpu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That will result in shitty looking-presets on slower machines, Magic.X, though go ahead, a lot of us have a good computer anyways.</div></div><hr />
