      <p class="post-content"><strong>How big is your AVS collection</strong><br />
      When I read from the club topic of Fsk's that he has about 2500 presets in his collection, first I thought that it is a huge collection. I checked mine: about 7500 presets (which about 1500 is mine btw.) Now I just want to know how big is an regular AVSser's AVS collection...</p>
