			<strong>A little help please (PimpBot)</strong><br />
		
		

		I just finished my third pack, but I need to know a couple of things about PimpBot  before I can publish it...<br />
<br />
1. How exactly do you add pictures that your presets use to the installer? Do I need to put them in a seperate folder or do i just select the folder that they are in and PimpBot detects which pictures it needs?<br />
<br />
2. How do I add an APE? IT brings up a list of APE's but the ones I need to include aren't in the list<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Dib<br />
<br />
PS I guess these questions are answered in another topic, but I couldn't find it...

		Pimpbot never works for me, I suggest you just get NSIS and someones script and do it yourself

		pimbot works fine.<br />
<br />
1.) i think I can answer it.<br />
at the begining you have a window additional files. so inside here you put a picture, and beside you tell what is this picture, if it is jpeg, you mark jpeg. <br />
the best think is that you do a new folder for the pictures and all the pictures that you want to have in your pack are in this folder.<br />
I think that pimbot does not detect on his own which pictures are needed.<br />
But i think that on this question the Yathoso will know the right answer

I have NSIS but I can't make head nor tail of it, if ya could point me to a sample script I'd be very grateful... The examples included aren't very helpful =/<br />
<br />
Thanks Blaz, I'll see if that works =)

<br />
but I think it might not work with the new NSIS, you might need to chop it about a bit. There are probably other example scripts out there, but I'd rather shamelessly promote my broken one cos it links to my devart page. Its worth learning NSIS, its a neat tool, ask yath he knows all about it and could prolly help u. Or you could try other parts of the forum...like the NSIS Discussion, durrr<br />

		And btw. Pimpbot is <b>made</b> with NSIS ;)<br />
<br />
Nsis is nifty indeed and for a simple avs pack installer you don't have to know that much about it.
