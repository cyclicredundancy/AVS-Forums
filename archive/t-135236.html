      <p class="post-content">SOme nice ideas and themes. I liked most of them but just a couple of things. You used the same colours in every preset. It gets boring and irritating after a while and please don't make two almost exactly the same presets and release both. Just choose one. Otherwise nice work. Good job :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok stuff, my favorite probably was <i>Descent</i> with those nice solid shapes in it.<br />
      <br />
      One word of advice tho, don't make different versions out of presets, unless they are really different from each other, in your two <i>Cosmic Forge</i> presets, the only thing different from one another seemed to be the pattern... That's a pretty small difference and in my opionion not worth of two versions.<br />
      <br />
      Nice work overall.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well the real theme behind the remix was a high FPS Version, which it achieves, but it turned into a neat retro remix, Ill be sure to add some neat code changes in to make it different, in fact I think I did change some of the code, to optimise speed a little ( I think )</p>
