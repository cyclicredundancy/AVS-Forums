      Id like to be able to leave the Winamp VIS playing along with my music but have the screen password locked at the same time. So to exit fullscreen mode on AVS I need a password.<br />
      <br />
      I use the winkey-l mode at the moment but Id like to leave the vis running instead.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm... That is an interesting idea...<br />
      <br />
      I guess it could be done. Just don't ask me to. I rememeber that my friend once wrote such a plugin for himself. Then his computer went bye-bye i.e. his hard drive broke. Too bad. It was so good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">use overlay and the blankscreen screensaver... that should do the trick if the color of the blankscreen is the same as the overlay color. thats not giving fullscreen mode a password lock... but its the closest i could think of.<br />
      <br />
      i doubt that is going to ever be added to avs since its well... "very powerful". i dunno how to put it... it just doesnt belong in avs, its the wrong sort of functionality.. avs shouldnt have an option to lock the computer... its the wrong place for it.</p>
