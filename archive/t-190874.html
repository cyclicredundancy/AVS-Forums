<div class="posttext">That's the first preset i post. It's not finished but it needs only minor changes. Can someone give his opinion and/or a little tips about optimisation? Thx!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm. the texture looks kinda cool, it wraps nicely. But the preset in whole is pretty dull. <br />
<br />
I know its your first 3d-dm thing, but the whole tunnel idea has been done to death. Be a bit more creative. <br />
<br />
Other than that...<br />
<br />
Dont use firewurx.<br />
<br />
Try making the bump actually do something. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What about this? It's the same preset but i used a fish eye projection. You are looking forward and backward at the same time! It's just I projected the image on a cilinder around the cam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Elasiel</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd August 2004, 10:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry! I don't know why i didn't upload the preset. I can't do two things at the same time and I'm usually breathing :). Here it goes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Elasiel</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd August 2004, 11:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It's even the same channel tunnel than before... But now it's in a super eye fish prejection! You see everything en every direction! I used a sphere for the projection this time. I'm going to try a beat transition between proj's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Elasiel</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd August 2004, 11:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">And finally, the final release! It goes trough the usual camera to a 360ยบ fish eye camera. As usual, any comments, sugestions optimisations are welcome</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They're quite nice, I expected a lot worse, as for suggestions:<br />
<br />
Disable that bump... it doesnt do anything except eat fps and misalign the texture edges.<br />
<br />
use $pi instead of typing it out, although thats only personal preference really.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a screen filler, like your x=i,y=i ssc and d=0 movement, better to make a dot ssc with x=0 y=0 n=1. And dont bilinear filter a d=0 movement, its pointless.<br />
<br />
thats about it. Nice preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">erm the bump does something... it makes the texture flash</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I wasnt being literal, I just meant it doesnt really bring anything to the preset in exchange for its ugly black line creation. Anyway a correctly placed on-beat clear would have a similar same effect and avoid the edge problem, plus it would suck less FPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sidd said that not to use firewurx. There's a special reason for that? Other than that, I'm thinking of throw away that bump (if weren't of those lines... :( ). I tryed the on-beat clean, but it lightens all the screen no matter where i put it. I suppose that exists a way to make that flash witout a bump so I'll be working on that point. Thx for the suggestions!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sidd said that not to use firewurx. There's a special reason for that?<br />
<br />
Not really a good reason if you rationalize it, but those that do avs instead of just watching it (the so called &quot;artists&quot;) hate fyrewurx.<br />
<br />
Why? Well maybe the most valid reason would be that it can't be customized other than color, which really is a bad bad thing. Also because of that it is considered as &quot;amateur&quot; and lame to use it.<br />
<br />
And besides, you get really sick of it after a while, trust me :p It really doesn't do much so it's a boring render.</div></div><hr />
