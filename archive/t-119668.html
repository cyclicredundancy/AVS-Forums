      <p class="post-content"><strong>Some Presets and a question</strong><br />
      I just created a couple of avs presets and was hoping I could get some feedback on them.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I'm trying to figure out 3-d sscs and dms and would like to know if anyone knows of a good website that can explain the conversion to 2d. I've tried searching the forum and it has helped out some, but I can't find a good website.<br />
      <br />
      thanx</p>

      <p class="post-content">Chaotic Shadows: Nice effect, very ParaNoya-ish. Don't use the on-beat source map, though - and try not to use source map in general (try inverting the equations first). When you do have to use source map, don't use it with blend; for some reason it doesn't work like it should. UnConeD might be able to explain, he's more familiar with the inner workings of AVS than the rest of us :)<br />
      <br />
      Chaotic Flowers: Very nice, but it could use some work. The mirror kind of ruins it, tho.<br />
      <br />
      Rotational Outrage: No offense meant, but this really bites, especially compared to the other two :/<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      As for 3D SSCs, check out my AVS Primer (available at <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">http://atero.deviantart.com/</a> somewhere). It has a tutorial with (unorthodox) derivations of 3d-2d translation and rotation, as well as outlines of all the default components of AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanx Atero. Yeah, I've had Chaotic Shadows sitting around on my computer for a while and just decided to throw it out there. I made rotational outrage in about 5 minutes but I like the psychedelic colors it has. Oh well, one man's trash is another's treasure.<br />
      Thx for the link, I'll check it out and hopefully I will start writing real 3-d scopes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, I checked out your primer and it has helped me out more than anything else I have seen. I still don't completely understand it, but with time comes knowledge... I hope.<br />
      <br />
      I made a cube and tried to optimize the code as much as I could figure out. I probably went down the completely wrong logic path. I'd like some feedback on it from anyone.<br />
      <br />
      Happy New Years Everyone</p>

      <p class="post-content">Rule one of AVS optimization: Don't do a calculation more times than you have to. An excellent example of this is calculating in pixel the sine of a variable that is calculated in frame - sin(zt), cos(zt), etc.<br />
      Rule two of AVS optimization: Never use functions if you don't have to. Wireframe cubes without faces, like this one, can be much more easily calculated point-by-point. This means you define the each point's position seperately. To do this, use a point-by-point counter (p=0 in frame, p=p+1 in pixel) and equal(p,[POINT])*[POSITION]. For cubes (and all generalized n-cubes), you don't need to define [POSITION] because the coordinates are equilateral; that is, they are either 1 or -1. So now we have to do this: plan a plot of the 8 points on a cube such that each point has a direct connection to each other adjacent point. Now, we enter equal(p,[POINT]) for each [POINT] where the coordinate on the cube is positive.<br />
      I know that sounds really vague, but since I don't want to spend two hours explaining it step by step, you'll have to contact me; preferably in real-time chat. I'm usually around on #finnish-flash at irc.quakenet.org.<br />
      If you don't know about IRC: Download mIRC (<a href="http://www.mirc.org" target="_blank">www.mirc.org</a> i think) and go to Options -&gt; Connections, then select QuakeNet from the drop-down list. Connect (the little z-shaped button), then type /join #finnish-flash.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oops, I thought I had optimized the sines and cosines. Btw, I am using a point by point counter but in a different way. The way your telling me to do it still uses the function equal(), but I believe mine uses it less times. Here's a version without the sines and cosines in per point.</p>

      <p class="post-content">there's no reason to use the bor(...) function, it's slow and bulky code-wise.<br />
      <br />
      i forgot to mention, you should probably do your translations after you rotate, so it doesn't look like it's being swung around on a string.</p>
