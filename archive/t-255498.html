		Really not bad at all for a first try!<br />
<br />
It's not that it's perfect, but surely a good way to start off from.<br />
You get the point of drawing your render stuff first and put the trans objects below it. You've also tried adjusting things, looked into some code (I think) and apart from the 'flashy'-ness it's really not that bad.<br />
<br />
some personal recommendations:<br />
remove the Color Modifier and add a Fast Brightness (set to 2x) at the end.<br />
<br />
Keep experimentating, that's what I recommend mostly for now. There are tutorials, but I'd wait a bit with those until you've experimented a bit more. (to be able to create an own style a bit better)<br />
<br />
Keep it up and good luck!
