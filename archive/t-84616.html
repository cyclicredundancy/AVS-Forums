      Here's a quick preview. I'm about half-finished with the pack (I'm aiming for 30 presets).<br />
      <br />
      Feedback is definitely welcome!</p>

      <p class="post-content">So far, 3 out of 5... :up: :up: :up:<br />
      3 of the 3 (ouch) preview presets are more abstract than beautiful (to my taste)<br />
      <br />
      We'll see if the whole pack gets at least 3.5 =)<br />
      (Note : The presets are kinda original tho... I'd say you should be able to score nicely in that category)<br />
      <br />
      Now, to learn how to use NSIS...</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't really need NSIS... PiMP is good too. If you really can't figure it out, I'll clean up the Whacko AVS NSIS script that I use, and you can modify it to your needs, if you want to. It installs the presets, can set AVS as the default plug-in and can also make sure that your intro preset shows up when starting AVS.<br />
      <br />
      I've been thinking though... none of the current packs are compatible with Winamp3, so we'll need to repackage them once the big switch-over happens. The default PiMP/NSIS installers only allows you to install in a directory that contains "winamp.exe"... however with WA3, the executable has changed names into "winamp3.exe".<br />
      <br />
      Btw Scarface: I don't know about undefined, but my nickname is about 3-4 years old :). There's a small explanation about my nick, but nothing interesting so I won't bore you with it...</p>
