		I've made this cool &quot;game&quot; preset in AVS 2.80, hope you like it.<br />
<br />
You will need to play it in a smallish window or have a fast machine.

		I have a fast machine (2.2 GHz) and it goes too slowly, even at the smallest window.  Try using framerate-independent decays.  Needs more to it to make it interesting.  Try adding an opponent or make the ball speed up with every bounce.  Also, the top of the screen doesn't bounce correctly (it goes off the screen before bouncing)<br />

		what about a little remix? ;)<br />
<br />
changes:<br />
 - ball is moving faster when you play longer<br />
 - cool solid 3D-looking rainbow ball<br />
 - color-coded paddle<br />
 - scoring system<br />
 - new bouncing of the paddle method (realistic)<br />
 - statistics (left mouse-click)<br />
<br />
sorry I removed your text, but it made game 2 times slower<br />
<br />
[edit] added a tail behind the ball. to remove it enable clear every frame in the fxlist inside 1st efxlist [/edit]

		It is strangely addictive!<br />
<br />
My high score so far is 865 or something.<br />
<br />
There is a problem somewhere. On RARE occasions the ball can come straight down, and then not bounce at other angles but straight up and down. It has only happened once where the ball was going exactly straight up and down, but 2 different times it was about 1 degree off from being straight.

		well, it depends on what version you downloaded. In the original the angle is calculated kinda randomly. In my version it depends on where did the ball hit paddle - if in the middle, than there is no change in angle.<br />
@ Supernova, you've got a pretty amazing score - I didn't ever rise above 400.<br />
@ Weirdal - what do you mean you have to play it fulscreen? it's even easier to play windowed. And, to make the ball change color, add &quot;bc=.4;t=t+rand(314)/100;&quot; on the beat in the ball SSC (the one below fadeout).
