<div class="posttext">Ok here goes, my first shot at alpha blending :). Guess I'm out already, having seen some of the submissions, but I still have to give it a shot right? Did a lot of forum searching on what alpha blending is, hope this is what the judges ment. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I hope the next round (if I'm in) is really something with names as it should be, instead of a technique contest.<br />

<div class="posttext">I finished my preset: alpha-ray damage (2 more dead). The alphablending is used to create the orange rings that act as a render and alphablending is also used as a way to change the colors. In around 10% of the beats, it'll go to a d=-d maximum blended mode. If you look carefully you can see that the center of the rotation is also the center of the colorchanging alpha. I hope you like it, because I sure do. :up: <br />

<br />
I was wondering the same thing.  It would make a big difference on the final outcome.  Personally, I don't think they should be accumulative.  If we did do it that way, then I don't think that we should kick anybody out each round.  Just go 3-5 rounds and then take the final scores and determine the winner.  But since we are kicking people out each round I don't think the scores should continue to add up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok, I am in the contest, so it is not fair from me to give suggestions, but anyway, Ishan and anubis, quickly decide what the next theme should be...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 09:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I have a suggestion, how about if we do this again we actually have the tournament. eg Name V Name, Name V Name, Name V Name unitl we have the quarter, smis and finally the final. Just thought i'd put that in here for the next time around because i don't think this is going to be implemented now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 10:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Then names should be selected along scores from the past round. It would be much fairer if I for example would compete against Magic.X than against m^2k. I don't know if it's doable, the differences are quite high. But we might do it in a future tournament.<br />
<br />
Btw. How very remarkably friendly and relevant are you again, Atero :p, even if your right. I agree on it that we shouldn't start replicating other peoples styles. The tournament was about own styles, right? We could use the word paranoya as theme, just like other words like fire, water, digital, and so on. But we shouldn't start copying other peoples styles.<br />
<br />
And even if we'd start copying other peoples styles, we should not take somebody like Paranoya, but earlier someone like El-Vis or Tuggummi. Not UnConed for sure, he's too hard for the major part of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 15:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No replicating styles is my opinion. Why would you want a whole bunch of presets that all look like past presets, come on the idea was to be creative not copy someones own style. Besides if you like paranoyas presets then watch paranoya presets, you don't need new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">13373571</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 16:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Raz:  Let's not have a knockout tournament (like I think you're saying) because people can get knocked out in the first round against someone who was just really lucky to get a subject he was good at. Example: <br />
<br />
First round is someonenotgoodatmath vs. UnConeD and the subject subject is krazy cool ray traced crap.  Someonenotgoodatmath might be able to beat UnConeD while making any other type of preset, but he just happens to get this one and get knocked out unfairly.<br />
<br />
I say the best contest would be:  judges say &quot;make a preset with just a superscope, a preset with no custom-programmable parts, a remix of BLANK, a copy of El-Vis's style, a preset that is clearly inspired by the title &quot;giant orange hippo wearing a tutu&quot;, a good use of XOR, and a flow preset.  No re-using old material. start NOW, submit your pack within fifteen days.&quot;  and then after fifteen days the judges look through all the packs and gives each preset a score out of 10 points.  The sum of each of the judges scores for a pack = the pack's total score.  The judges can't talk to eachother or anyone else about the quality of the presets until they have all submitted their scores to the head judge (who doesn't vote and is a trustworthy person).  The head judge releases the total scores after he recieves all the other judge's scores.<br />
<br />
I think that this would be the fastest and fairest way to do a competition...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice idea for a comp but i still like my isea, so what if people get knocked out straight away, they should've been better in that area, and anyway, it shouldn't be raytracing because only a few can do that, it should be a title, you know something anything can be done with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A knockout tournament would have to be combined with a league, at least if this tournament's contestant amount is something to go after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">13373571</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 18:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Again raz, what if someone who isn't that good just happens to come up with a really good preset based on &quot;satan's fearsome sci fi space furby&quot; one round and knocks out someone who otherwise would've won the tournament but just couldn't come up with a good interpretation.  Just two presets (one from each opponent) isn't enough material to decide who's the best overall imho.  I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Why don't we just do both types of tournament, one after the other or at the same time...<br />
<br />
edit: runar, it won't be about something to go after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 19:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah that was my point, do another tournament like i said. Ad if you can't come up with a good interpretation, tough, you should've done. It doesn't matter what they could've done, it's what they do. Rival tournaments aren't meant to be user friendly, they're supposed to be complex and intimidating, and if you fail, you lose, you're off the team, tough. Just because some good people might get knocked out doesn't mean it's not a good idea, if they're such good avsers they wont get knocked out. You see my point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">13373571</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2003, 19:22</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Just because some good people might get knocked out doesn't mean it's not a good idea, if they're such good avsers they wont get knocked out. You see my point? <br />
<br />
Ok, wait a minute....<br />
<br />
some good people might get knocked out  <br />
if they're such good avsers they wont get knocked out.<br />
<br />
No, I don't get your point.<br />
<br />
But I understand that if the idea of the tournament is more to create fun competition than to decide who's necessarily the best contestant, then a knockout tournament might be the best. So that's why I say do both types of tournament since both have their good points, and you seem to agree, so let's stop arguing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dance of the Seraphim<br />
<br />
www.pantheon.org/articles/s/seraphim.html<br />
<br />
Seraphim<br />
<br />
Divine creatures from the Old Testament, associated with the Cherubim, and later taken to be angels. The root of Seraphim comes either from the Hebrew verb saraph ('to burn') or the Hebrew noun saraph (a fiery, flying serpent). Because the term appears several times with reference to the serpents encountered in the wilderness (Num. 21.8, Deut. 8.15; Isa. 14.29; 30.6), it has often been understood to refer to &quot;fiery serpents.&quot; From this it has also often been proposed that the seraphim were serpentine in form and in some sense &quot;fiery&quot; creatures or associated with fire. <br />
<br />
It is said that whoever lays eyes on a Seraph, he would instantly be incinerated due to the immense brightness of the Seraph. They are described as very tall, with six wings and four heads, one for of the cardinal directions. One pair of wings are for flying, one for covering their eyes (for even they may not look directly at God), and one for covering their feet (which is almost certainly a euphemism for genitalia). They are in the direct presence of God. <br />
<br />
In Isaiah's call-vision in the Temple, he sees Seraphim surrounding the throne of God, singing praise to God; the &quot;Thrice Holy&quot; hymn (ch 6). In this instance they are angelic beings but in the Book of Numbers, seraph-snakes are sent to punish the Israelites. <br />
<br />
Some of the Seraphim are Metatron, Kemuel, Nathanael, Gabriel, and Lucifer. <br />

<div class="posttext">Nice :), though I don't see what it has to do with the topic, except the nice story you added. The preset looks great on the other hand. I'm not sure what it's supposed to look like (I run it with about 6 FPS) :s. Now let's see what the judges think, will they fall for beauty, or will they think it hasn't got to do enough with the topic?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I was just about to edit my reply when I read this, having read the text more carefully and only then realising the depth of it. Should indeed have taken you quite some time to find that all out. Sorry skupers, I didn't mean to be so harsh (or wathever the word is, in Dutch, which you understand: lomp). Also the preset looks great, it also contains a shitload of quite some nice skills. It just didn't look like an angel to me, but then again, nobody knows how they look. I guess I expected something with wings and a golden ring on it's head or so. So, I take all my words back, and my excuses to skupers. It's a great preset with the best background I've yet seen. Congrats, I hope you accept my apoligies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Um, it would be nice of ishan to pm deamon the theme for the next round or something, so he can do the preset. If he qualifes and isn't able to do a preset it will be unfair for the people who didn't qualify. I think it would be better for everyone to PM him the theme for the next round, so he can do the preset and send it to Ishan who would post the preset here after the theme has been announced to everyone. If he doesn't qualify, ishan just wouldn't have to post teh preset. That's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is my submission, hope you'll like it.<br />
<br />
I used the delay and slideshow ape.<br />
<br />
As the slideshow ape is a bit tricky with redistribution, you may have to set it up yourself. Copy the Fire Folder into the avsdir and set it in the ape.<br />
<br />
It should work this way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">erm.... Ishan? I just found out it's not possible to send attachments with PM's. When the final preset is done, should I post it here, which means everyone knows the topic for the next round, or what? I can hold it for a day or two if you like. Let me know soon please.<br />
<br />
Now let's hope I'm on to the next round, I'm quite proud of this one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok Anubis, I'm mailing it to you right now. Please note that the preset is designed for framerates between 6 to 8. I've watched it on a creepy fast computer and with framerates too high it looks still pretty nice, but not as it's ment to be. (you can lower FPS with the options -&gt; display -&gt; window performance slidebar).<br />
<br />
<br />
I't's a square window preset, if you view it with other resolutions it'll draw ugly lines along the borders, which are not ment to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm, i really hate to do this, but i really doubt that i could be fucked making a preset by sunday. I have an idea, but i cant see me following through with it. Im having way to much fun at the moment.<br />
<br />
Im on holiday btw, i took a vacation in a small country town, where i know noone. Its great, this is the first ive been on the internet in the past week and a half i think. (probably the longest ive been since i was about 13 :D) Blessed net-cafe's. <br />
<br />
Any way, if i dont get anything in, im really sorry to fuck up the whole tournament, (though im sure its not that big a deal to you all. Raz dude, cant wait to see your sweet idea so i guess ill check back again on sunday.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hahaha.. lol.. <br />
i was really looking forward to raz's preset.. seeing as there are only two left, i suggest we give them time, and let the other two update also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th July 2003, 17:20</div></div>
<br />

Custom titles or rewards aren't necessary. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">skupers</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th July 2003, 09:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Congratulations Raz. You deserved it. <br />
<br />
That last round had amazing presets. Raz's preset had great colors, I loved Nixa's flow preset (is it a fractal?) and ofcourse I like my own preset.<br />
<br />
I was 2nd, 1st and 2nd in the rounds. That isn't bad either :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th July 2003, 10:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">heh, well now that its all over, i finaly found some time and energy to make my own preset today.<br />
I dont expect you guys to accept it, so dont get all huffy with me.<br />
Included is the texture, redfluidplastic.bmp, i have no idea where it came from, but i hgope whoever made it doesnt mind me using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th July 2003, 21:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So... aren't we making a pack out of this or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th July 2003, 08:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">all one has to do is take the two zip packs(which anubis made in previous pages) and the last round presets and then send it to some one who can make a nice installer script.(i'm not too good at it:( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th July 2003, 15:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">And here's the third round presets.  I would have put all 3 rounds in one zip, but it's too big to attach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th July 2003, 17:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">so, anyone with a nice installer script?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Do we start another tournament? Maybe this time with more contestants ;). Anyone care to join in another one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th August 2003, 14:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Aw, not right now, please, i'm going away in 20 minutes. Back in a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th August 2003, 16:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">no problem mate, have a nice vacation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2003, 09:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So do we start another round? We can open signup for it now already, I'm quite confident Raz will be in again, and so will I. It'll take some time for everyone who wants to to join in, so maybe open a new thread for it? That is, if there is enough interest in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2003, 09:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm ready for it. I can become a judge again if you all agree if you dont i can becomr a contestant.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2003, 13:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sure, be whatever you want :) We need judges so it would be great if you'd take that task on you again (with some others), though if you'd like to join as contestant, which is fully understandable, we'll select other judges. But yes, I agree on you becoming judge, you did a nice job previous tournament.<br />
<br />
<br />
so should I open a new topic for it? I guess almost everyone except previous round contestants don't read this topic, if we want more and new contestant we have to draw some attention ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2003, 15:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ill be in again. <br />
Though i seem to be spending too little time online, and too much time in the cinemas lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2003, 17:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:) good to hear you're in, enjoy the movies.</div></div><hr />
