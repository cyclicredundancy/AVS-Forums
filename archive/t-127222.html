<div class="posttext">Your coding looks superb, but you need to work on the aesthetic side of the presets a bit more. Here is a small review of the presets:<br />
<br />
Danse - Looks like a weird cult ritual :D Not bad, could be better tho. Adding a fadeout helps this one a bit, but i wouldn't use the rotoblitter&amp;interferences in the first place.<br />
<br />
Zodiac - The scope looks nice, but the use of the water filter just messes it up and there isn't much fun in the scope anymore.<br />
<br />
Geometric - Again some nifty scopes, but the use of the fyrewurx ape ruins the whole preset.<br />
<br />
Helice - Well this isn't bad, the scopes look great in this one.<br />
Oscillo - Original idea, i like it.<br />
<br />
Grille - Add a fadeout into this since it gets messy and you can't see the scopes very well. The scopes respond to beat really nicely<br />
<br />
Anneaux - Not too good, the pattern is messy and the dynamove just isn't one of the most original ones.<br />
<br />
Arabesq - Kinda weird, but i like it. Could use something as a background tho.<br />
<br />
Evsatpoly Now this is what i like! Great scopes, the color is good and the scopes respond so well to music. Also + for making a background into it.<br />
<br />
Paysage - Love the floor in it.<br />
<br />
Starwar - Heh, ihave also tried this, it's cool, but doesn't really make much of a music visualizer.<br />
<br />
Avoscesp - Maybe some will say that this has been done before, but i still like it. The sound reactive &quot;buildings&quot; look great and that laser shooting is great.<br />
<br />
Danseur - This is what i really like, it's the best of them all. My only critism in this is that the dance is quite monotoneus, it could need some randomizing. But the Dancer itself looks awesome!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Great presets! You got your way on coding, now just work on making them look good. Oh and i know this sounds like an insult, but could you use english? I would very much like to know what you are talking about in your comments etc. :)<br />
<br />

*edit added one more preset review*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some of those are pretty impressive. Though the lack of fadeout on some makes so you can't see the good stuff. There were a couple that had whiteout problems.<br />
<br />
Next time could you zip and attach them?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi !<br />
<br />
Many thanks to Tuggumi ! It's a complete test !<br />
<br />
I don't think I will change the existing oresets, but I keep your remarks in my mind for the next ones ...<br />
<br />
Sorry for the french, but my site is first dedicated to french speakers ... but anyone can see AVS presets without understanding the original language (may be there's an exception with Starwar ...).<br />
<br />
About the comments : in Starwar, I just tell that the user can change the text as he wants ; and in Danseur that the BPM is there in order to &quot;manually&quot; synchronize the dancer with the music, but it can be removed to use the AVS beat detection ...<br />
<br />
<br />
To Jaheckelsafar : If there is a next time, I'll think to zip them ...<br />
<br />
Thanks !<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I agree with tuggummi.  Work with your aesthetics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looking cool, you certainly know how to use SSC's, but when it comes fo fading and movements, I agree with Jaheckelsafar... it's kinda hard for the eyes. You might want to take a closer look on that.<br />
<br />
Another thing, to download every preset one by one takes some time. you might want to add them to a zip-file on your site so everybody can d/l all of them simultaneously.</div></div><hr />
