      <p class="post-content"><strong>question about 'screen flicker'</strong><br />
      I know this comes about (for me at least) when you have either too many buffer saves and/or restores, but I am wondering if there is some rule of thumb as to keeping flicker to a minimum. Or if there are some transitions that should not be made in cunjunction with a buffer save (and/or restore).<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your patience with the noob...:up: :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">could it be that you accidentally checked "alternate save/restore"?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I gues that's my question, then. Is that an option not to be used? Or if so, please give me a hypothetical instance when you might use it. (I knew that was a little beyond my scope just yet! :D)</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm i can't remember that i ever used that option...<br />
      (actually i can't even remeber that anyone ever used thatoption ;))<br />
      <br />
      normally i use the buffer in order to get a previously stored frame back in an other part of the preset. That's all what the frame-buffers are suposed to do in my opinion. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">flickering happens when you dont check 'clear every frame' on certain trans effects, it doesnt have anything specifically to do with buffer saves</p>

      <p class="post-content">you mean, like when you unprofessionally set an invert!? Well actually you get a similar flickerning when you check "alternate save/restore" on a buffer.<br />
      But you're right: <i>most</i> flickering happens when you've unchecked "clear every frame" together with some trans/effects.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, thank you. I have probabaly had the flicker from both instances at different times. That should steer me clear of it in the future.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You'll never get rid of 'flickering' until you understand where it comes from. AVS processes every effect in order, using the last frame as a starting point (unless "clear every frame" is checked).<br />
      <br />
      If the operations contain some form of inverting in them, then flickering will result as a result of the feedback of frames. The simplest example is Trans / Invert in an empty preset. The frame starts out black, is inverted to white, is drawn, is inverted to black, is drawn, is inverted to white, is drawn, etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That explains it perfectly. thanks, UnConed. At the risk of telling you something you've heard a million times, your presets are possibly THE best out there.</p>
