<div class="posttext">I know this comes about (for me at least) when you have either too many buffer saves and/or restores, but I am wondering if there is some rule of thumb as to keeping flicker to a minimum. Or if there are some transitions that should not be made in cunjunction with a buffer save (and/or restore).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience with the noob...:up: :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">could it be that you accidentally checked &quot;alternate save/restore&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, I gues that's my question, then. Is that an option not to be used? Or if so, please give me a hypothetical instance when you might use it. (I knew that was a little beyond my scope just yet! :D)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm i can't remember that i ever used that option...<br />
(actually i can't even remeber that anyone ever used thatoption ;))<br />
<br />
normally i use the buffer in order to get a previously stored frame back in an other part of the preset. That's all what the frame-buffers are suposed to do in my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">flickering happens when you dont check 'clear every frame' on certain trans effects, it doesnt have anything specifically to do with buffer saves</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you mean, like when you unprofessionally set an invert!? Well actually you get a similar flickerning when you check &quot;alternate save/restore&quot; on a buffer.<br />
But you're right: most flickering happens when you've unchecked &quot;clear every frame&quot; together with some trans/effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, thank you. I have probabaly had the flicker from both instances at different times. That should steer me clear of it in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You'll never get rid of 'flickering' until you understand where it comes from. AVS processes every effect in order, using the last frame as a starting point (unless &quot;clear every frame&quot; is  checked).<br />
<br />
If the operations contain some form of inverting in them, then flickering will result as a result of the feedback of frames. The simplest example is Trans / Invert in an empty preset. The frame starts out black, is inverted to white, is drawn, is inverted to black, is drawn, is inverted to white, is drawn, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That explains it perfectly. thanks, UnConed. At the risk of telling you something you've heard a million times, your presets are possibly THE best out there.</div></div><hr />
