      <p class="post-content"><strong>Video Cards and AVS'us</strong><br />
      My friend and I got into a good natured arguement concerning AVS.<br />
      I was under the assumption the AVS had _nothing_ to do with your video card, and they only speed up (or down)[in framerate] you could have would be from a faster (or slower) CPU.<br />
      He said that although the chip did matter _a lot_ the vid card also had a major part in the rendering of the AVS. Bascially, he told me i was deadass wrong. :mad:<br />
      Can someone intimately familiar (:p) with AVS clear this up?<br />
      <br />
      <br />

      (P.S. i better as hell be right :D )</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nope. The only thing your video card does is receive the image from system memory and display it, i.e. nothing more than it is doing regularly in Windows.<br />
      <br />
      All the important work is done by the CPU... this can easily be proven by looking at the APE SDK: the image is an array of bytes in system ram.<br />
      <br />
      A faster/newer video card will make little difference, unless the previous one was really old and had crappy drivers.<br />
      <br />
      Because of all the attention video cards have been getting recently, lots of people seem to consider themselves self-proclaimed graphics experts :P.</p>
