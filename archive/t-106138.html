<div class="posttext">My friend and I got into a good natured arguement concerning AVS.<br />
I was under the assumption the AVS had _nothing_ to do with your video card, and they only speed up (or down)[in framerate] you could have would be from a faster (or slower) CPU.<br />
He said that although the chip did matter _a lot_ the vid card also had a major part in the rendering of the AVS. Bascially, he told me i was deadass wrong. :mad: <br />
Can someone intimately familiar (:p) with AVS clear this up?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(P.S. i better as hell be right :D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nope. The only thing your video card does is receive the image from system memory and display it, i.e. nothing more than it is doing regularly in Windows.<br />
<br />
All the important work is done by the CPU... this can easily be proven by looking at the APE SDK: the image is an array of bytes in system ram.<br />
<br />
A faster/newer video card will make little difference, unless the previous one was really old and had crappy drivers.<br />
<br />
Because of all the attention video cards have been getting recently, lots of people seem to consider themselves self-proclaimed graphics experts :P.</div></div><hr />
