			<strong>Matrix Code???</strong><br />
		
		

		Has anyone seen an avs yet that resembles the matrix code?? I haven't hung around these forums, so I don't know if this topic has been brought up before, so if it has... sorry..<br />
I have not seen any avs that even slightly resembles the code, so if anyone can tell me where I could find such an avs, or if it exists, I would appreciate it.. thanx..<br />

		Obviously you haven't hung around forums or the Internet much either.<br />
<br />
Go here <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/search.php</a><br />
<br />
and type 'AVS Matrix' in the Search By Keyword section.<br />
<br />
It is like magic just like the architect himself had written it. It is amazing what you can do on computer now-a-days isn't it.<br />
<br />
OR what about this a media player called winamp has it's own website called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com" target="_blank">www.winamp.com</a> and there is a plugins section there and guess what a search box. And you will get many many matches for matrix style code there are preview pictures and everything.<br />
<br />
Even going to the underground website called  <br />
<a href="http://www.Google.com" target="_blank">www.Google.com</a> and typing the same thing will bless you with AVS presets.<br />
<br />
Lazyness is no excuse.

		Hey, thanks for being sarcastic about it.. I like spicy people.. without them, there would be no jerks in this world, and that wouldn't be much fun now, would it??<br />
Anyway, I check this so called &quot;google&quot; (that is set as my friggin' homepage) and got no results... but thanks for the insight..

		And don't double post plz. It's is quite annoying. And don't go about me being a jerk just because I point something out you're doing wrong, you can see it as positive critism: learn from it, don't do it again, everybody happy.<br />
<br />
Btw: there is an edit button, you might want to try that.
