<div class="posttext">Has anyone seen an avs yet that resembles the matrix code?? I haven't hung around these forums, so I don't know if this topic has been brought up before, so if it has... sorry..<br />
I have not seen any avs that even slightly resembles the code, so if anyone can tell me where I could find such an avs, or if it exists, I would appreciate it.. thanx..<br />

<div class="posttext">Obviously you haven't hung around forums or the Internet much either.<br />
<br />
Go here http://forums.winamp.com/search.php<br />
<br />
and type 'AVS Matrix' in the Search By Keyword section.<br />
<br />
It is like magic just like the architect himself had written it. It is amazing what you can do on computer now-a-days isn't it.<br />
<br />
OR what about this a media player called winamp has it's own website called www.winamp.com and there is a plugins section there and guess what a search box. And you will get many many matches for matrix style code there are preview pictures and everything.<br />
<br />
Even going to the underground website called  <br />
www.Google.com and typing the same thing will bless you with AVS presets.<br />
<br />
Lazyness is no excuse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And don't double post plz. It's is quite annoying. And don't go about me being a jerk just because I point something out you're doing wrong, you can see it as positive critism: learn from it, don't do it again, everybody happy.<br />

Btw: there is an edit button, you might want to try that.</div></div><hr />
