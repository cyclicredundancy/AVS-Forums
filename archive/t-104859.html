<div class="posttext">Yep, you read right. After 4 months since Explosion came out, the new pack has finally arrived. Get it from the links in my sig, and I hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I did creating it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No time to go in depth righ now (school and all) :(<br />
<br />
Initial reactions:<br />
- No Winamp2 install, but I can take it.<br />
- is the fire supposed to be at the top of a mile from hell?<br />
- nice pack overall. Your presets have evolved :up:<br />
<br />
Tune in later for more detail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh hell (sorry :p). I put in a screen reverse because the DM put the thing up the top. Don't tell me I've got a compatibility problem. Did the screen reverse install, because it did on mine.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Figured out what happened. I had winamp and AVS running when I copied the pack into the right directory. AVS didn't think they were there.<br />
<br />
one funky discoball<br />
Looks nice, but static. Maybe some colours and an onbeat gradual reversal of the swirl direction.<br />
<br />
nova rush<br />
Requires a certain type of music that I don't feel like listeninng to right now. :) With some nice happy hardcore techno it would get you pumped.<br />
<br />
glow ball<br />
With the right superscope, this could be awsome. Right now it's kinda cool. I like the &quot;fingers&quot; on the glowball.<br />
<br />
postmodern<br />
I like this one. :)<br />
<br />
the advantage pack<br />
Nice and simple. I think it should be the first one in the pack though.<br />
<br />
meant to be<br />
would benefit from a more stuff going on in the background. I added a second effect list and  used a buffer save, switched the movement to a DM and use the buffer as the source.<br />
<br />
can't tune in<br />
Not bad for relaxing. With some variety in the movement (speed changes, distortions, etc) it could be pretty cool.<br />
<br />
motion picture journey<br />
Pretty cool, but I wouldn't watch it for any extended period of time.<br />
<br />
dying star<br />
Looks pretty nice. Again, a chilling preset. Some colour shifting would be good.<br />
<br />
hall of sound<br />
You got rid of the distortion, nice. :) It'd be cooler if the spots brighness corresponded with an oscilliscope or spectrum value though.<br />
<br />
lake of fire<br />
Pretty good. I liked it better after I made the rotation do a gradual shift, and made it go in both directions.<br />
<br />
dreamers disease<br />
Pretty nice, but I've seen that kind of thing before.<br />
<br />
inside a flower<br />
Again, I think a gradual shift in speed would be better. I like things that flow.<br />
<br />
push away<br />
Not bad. It looks a lot mopre interesting when visfrac is set to 50/50 blend though.<br />
<br />
stained glass window<br />
You're right. It does take a while to get started. Some color separation would be good, but I don't think you can do that, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
the edge<br />
Nice. A little too bright though (oww my eyes). Sometimes you lose the colours.<br />
<br />
swirling dancefloor<br />
That is a neat effect. I'd like it a little higher off the floor though.<br />
<br />
a mile from hell<br />
I think the glowing points would be better if the starfield didn't move and just scrolled up. BTW you could fix the upside down thing by making the whole statement negative in your DM instead of using screen reverse. It gave me 2 FPS.<br />
<br />
analyser cube<br />
Good one. :up: I'd have made the cube rotate faster, but to each his own.<br />
<br />
nova rush 2<br />
I had a whiteout problem with this one. Too often too much of the screen was entirely white. BTW. You did do some coding in the superscope :p.<br />
<br />
musical breakdown<br />
Meh, this one didn't do much for me.<br />
<br />
undersea exploration<br />
Nifty. This one was nice. It had a whiteout problem too, but not as bad as nova rush 2.<br />
<br />
stick diso<br />
Watch out Mr. Happy. :) I foud the arm movments a litte repetative, and the didn't go with the beat :(. The floor looked pretty nice though.<br />
<br />
halucination 4<br />
Again, it's all about the smooth transitions. Looked pretty nice though.<br />
<br />
computerized nebula<br />
Me like :up:. Too bad you can't go completely upside down.<br />
<br />
Landscape<br />
A little bland for me.<br />
<br />
Wormhole<br />
Looks pretty good, but I'm missing the smooth movement transitions.<br />
<br />
Swirly Stuff<br />
Kinda neat. Too bad it only swirls in.<br />
<br />
Tribute<br />
Didn't do much for me, and here's not the place to go into why.<br />
<br />
psychadelic nebula<br />
I liked this, but it could use something in the middle for when there is no beat detected.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
Big improvement of your last pack. Your later ones are looking really nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I cant live up to that enormous review, the words I will use are:<br />
<br />
nice, very nice. good work keep it up.<br />
<br />
Also, you know that the answer to you sig question isn't undefined since you can define it in terms of the inital water level... that confused me. You can ignore that if you want, it's just me being awkward.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The answer isn't undefined, it's simple logic. As the tide rises, it brings the boat and ladder attached with it, so the water never reaches the fourth rung. It's simply infinity.:igor:</div></div><hr />
