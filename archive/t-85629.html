<div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
I have installed 2 video cards they both work fine I have seen AVS work as the desktop of the secondary screen... but now when I change to overlay mode and set desktop to colour the Visualisation doesn't show on the second screen, the second screen just goes a red colour... yet when I turn it back off the desktop picture comes back. I have tried turning Overlay mode and set desktop to colour on in different sequence but the screen still just turns red and no Visualisation... but the Visualisation still works on the primary screen...<br />
<br />
Any Idea on why this isn't working?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I use a matrox g400 with tc out(a also tried it with a gforce)<br />
One video card:<br />
Desktop on the monitor start overlay(g400: activate dualhead max(for watching movies on tv). and you will have your ordanairy desktop at the monitor and the Visuals at the tv out</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Set the gforce as primary display, but yould still want to use it to project, so you'll have to move the taskbar and all your icons over to the secondary display (the S3) on the monitor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I ran into similar problems..<br />
<br />
<br />
 It seems to be glitchy when you bring multiple monitors into the situation.<br />
<br />
 I've managed to get it to work all the time using only two displays (I actually have three). By doing what the others have suggested. Whichever display you want to use to projec, set as primary display, then move your icons and taskbar etc. to your secondary desktop. Now if you run Avs on your secondary desktop you should be able to overlay it to the primary. <br />
<br />
 I use this all the time, the red you are seeing wouldn't happen to be your overlay color would it? I've taken to using black as a black desktop is what I like anyways.<br />
<br />
 For a limited time, I had it working with the overlay going to two displays at the same time (tv and second monitor), but since I updated my drivers, I lost that ability. Too bad too, it was a great help..<br />
<br />
 Hope this helps you out, good luck</div></div><hr />
