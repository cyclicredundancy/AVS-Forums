		<b>Intro</b>:  Goofy :)<br />
<b>++++++</b>:  Oh man that's aesthetically pleasing...  Great colors, nice flow!  Awesome.<br />
<b>Av(s)atar</b>:  I think the background could be a little interactive with the main object but it isn't too shabby.<br />
<b>Spiral Splash</b>:  I can't really read the background, but I like the style and colors.<br />
<b>Cube Spectrum</b>:  You sure like those spectrum presets.  Nice job and the shading with those texers.  If I hadn't looked to see that you used texer II I might not have noticed.<br />
<b>Kill Visbot</b>:  Haha!  Good stuff.  I can't say I'm really interested in playing it but it looks fairly nice.<br />
<b>Blob Me Silly</b>:  Beautiful blob you got there.  Sometimes when it separates it looks a little eek, but it stays together pretty well.<br />
<b>Flash Design</b>:  I think this one could use a little more interest.  It just doesn't catch my eye like some of your other ones.<br />
<b>Lost and Found</b>:  If I had to imagined being buried alive under snakes, this would be it.  Nice curvy code.<br />
<b>Toothpaste Commercial</b>:  Haha so I saw this preset and thought of toothpaste even before I read the title.  It has a nice *fresh* look to it :)<br />
<b>Sexy Objects 3-Some</b>:  I like the almost cell-shaded feel to the objects.  <br />
<b>Biomechanica</b>:  I read the comment and I'm not seeing and circles.  I just see the scopes so maybe something is wrong with my setup.  The scopes look nice though.<br />
Shredder[/B]:  This one doesn't really do it for me, but that's just me.<br />
<b>Sound Tube</b>:  I kinda wish you had set the alphain a little lower so there was more flow but either way the tube looks nice.  I think it might have been cool if you added a scope inside the tube, but to each his own.<br />
<b>Razorblades III</b>:  Nice scopes, nice blood.  I like it<br />
<b>Flurries</b>:  I don't quite get the name.  I think it could use a little less spin in the flow.  When you pause it freaks out a bit.<br />
<b>The Evil Machine</b>:  Good textures.  Good colors.<br />
<b>Why does it always rain on me</b>:  This preset looks very unconed to me.  Good job on the rain and ripples.<br />
<b>Billboard Top 40's</b>:  Ooo I like this one.  Nice shadow.  Great colors.  :)<br />
<b>Frost Spikes</b>:  This one is beautiful!  Awesome colors and a background to match.  Gorgeous!<br />
<b>Little Buggers</b>:  I read the comment and I actually like that they all move together.<br />
<b>Twin Glow</b>:  Simple but effective.  Great colors.  Could be more shape movement.<br />
<b>Eye Strain Strings</b>:  I love the background on this preset.  I think the shadows could be a little lighter.  They contrast a little too much for me.<br />
<b>Weaving Golden Threads</b>:  Shiny.  Really shiny.<br />
<b>Here Here Little Jellyfish</b>:  I think the tentacles could be a less spinny and the jellyfish a lttle less jumpy, I really like this preset.  The water looks awesome!  The jelly fish looks great.  Great job!<br />
<br />
I guess that's all of them.  So yeah I think my favorite was +++++.  Overall a pretty delicious pack Tuggummi. <br />

		Thanks UIUC85 :D<br />
Sorry, i think i forgot your name from the intro :(<br />
<br />
Btw. I get the feeling you didn't see this pack when i first submitted it?<br />
Anyway, thanks for the lenghty comment there!<br />
<br />
btw. i did some testing with biomechanica, and even after i load it through my global scrambler, it still works for me, weird :weird:

		Hmm, i am obligated to comment on your pack? Then eat this huge comment! :p<br />
<font size="1">Well, actually i would've commented anyhow! ;)</font><br />
<br />
<b>Intro</b>: Hehe! Really funny and innovative! (And btw, thanks for mentioning me!) :)<br />
<b>+++++++++++++</b>: This one is stylish as hell! :cool: One of my favourite preset-stlyes and certainly one of my favourites in this pack! :up:<br />
<b>Av(s)atar</b>: Funny idea! But unfortunately it doesn't react to music that much so it's not the best you're capable of. Though, the colors are well chosen!<br />
<b>Slash Spiral</b>: The spirals are really cool, but i think you didn't succeed well with the background. It's a bit too dark imho and i also can hardly read the text. Anyway, it's still a nice preset i like to watch!<br />
<b>Cube Spectrum</b>: My next favourite in this pack! Simple but stylish, plain scopes but effective music response! :)<br />
<b>Kill Visbot</b>: One of the best AVS-games i've seen so far! It's highly addictive! :D<br />
<b>Blob me silly</b>: Hmm, haven't i seen this one before? Anyway, this is certainly everything else than outdated! ;) Next favourite!<br />
<b>Flash Design</b>: It's really tidy and stylish, but somehow the background is still missing something. But unfortuantely i can't exactly tell exactly what...<br />
<b>Lost and Found</b>: It never seems to get boring for me, though i already knew this preset since it's first release! Well, guess it just entwines you! :)<br />
Also one of my favourites.<br />
<b>Toothpaste Commercial</b>: And another favourite in this Pack! When i came to this preset i just had to laugh! Good idea, even better execution... But wait! Didn't you say it came out by accident?! :D<br />
<b>Sexy Objects 3-Some</b>: Indeed, these objects are sexy! :cool: Only the background doesn't fit so well...<br />
<b>Biomechanica</b>: In contrary to most others who commented on this preset i have no problems with the Texer II rings and dots. Everything shows up as it should, so i can just enjoy watching this nice preset in it's full splendour! :p<br />
<b>Shredder</b>: I'm wondering why you didn't use the &quot;upwards motion blur version&quot; as standard, cause i'm losing not more than 10fps by that. Anyhow, since i'm not a fan of those games you were referring to i don't really get the taste, sorry.<br />
<b>Sound Tube</b>: When i first saw it, i immediately liked it, but when i read UIUC85's sugestion to add a scope in the middle of the tube i had to try it out and i must say that's even a tad better! Anyway, still a good preset!<br />
<b>Razorblades</b>: Wow, this is great! Perfect style! ...and yet another favourite of mine! ;)<br />
<b>Flurries</b>: Sorry, but it seems as if i'm not a big fan of flow-presets... But nevertheless, the colors are really neat!<br />
<b>Evil Machine</b>: Damn, i also want to be able to make such cool dm-presets! :( I guess somehow i could actually manage that, but i'd just be too lazy (or stupid?) to bring it to an end..<br />
<b>Why does it always rain on me?</b>: I'm pretty sure you were inspired by the Travis-song &quot;Why does it always rain on me?&quot; while making this preset, cause it fits pretty good. Also it's really not bad that it didn't turned out as you planed it, since it's still so melancholic... Actually i'm also pretty melancholic atm, so i'll most probably watch this one more often now... Let's say it's my &quot;mood-favourite&quot; of this pack.<br />
<b>Billboard top 40's</b>: The texer-scope is pretty cool! And so are the &quot;nemo-style&quot; background squares! I like it! :)<br />
<b>Frost Spikes</b>: Not much to say here. It's just damn cool! :eek:<br />
<b>Little Buggers</b>: Yeah! Put on some loud music and those buggers start to freak out! Very nice! :D<br />
<b>Twin Glow</b>: Ahh! Analyzer with beautiful glowing colors! Appreciate these presets! :up:<br />
<b>Eye Strain Strings</b>: Actually my eyes didn't get strained in any way while watching this neat preset, so i guess you've just been too overtired again! ;)<br />
<b>Weaving Golden Threads</b>: The music reaction leaves a bit more to be desired, but still a watchable preset!<br />
<b>Here here little Jellyfish</b>: At first i have to dissapoint you: Raz already made a cool jellyfish model in his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=142099" target="_blank">first pack</a>. But though i like that model a bit more i still prefer your preset (actually this is also one of my favourites... ;)). Namely that is because of the much better &quot;atmosphere&quot;. Escpecially the water background is awesome! :D

<br />
ps. (and you've seen those dedications presets on the dedications pack ;))<br />
<br />
pps. Yeah, i totally forgot about raz, i hope he's not mad or anything :(<br />
<br />
ppps. (is there even such a thing?) Yes the song &quot;why does it always rain on me&quot; was in my head, but strangely enough i don't have it myself :)

<br />
Travis are really good (got two of their albums here) but i haven't listened to them for quite a while now. But since i saw your preset i had to dig out that certain song and now i'm listening to the albums once again.<br />
btw: You can find the lyrics of that particular song <a href="http://www.travisonline.com/travis/lyrics/album02.html" target="_blank">here</a> (under Single 3).<br />

		Of course i will, because im sexier than you :p Everyone when they hear the name &quot;Tuggummi&quot; they will instantly think: &quot;Oh, that great, handsome and sexy AVSer, yeah his stuff is the best!&quot;<br />
While when they hear the name &quot;PAK-9&quot; they go all: &quot;Who? What? A guy who thinks AVS is ment for CODING?! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHA! That's the lamest thing i've ever heard!&quot;<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
Seriously put, mindscapes by hboy has the most downloads at the moment, so logic would be that it would be the one that gets pushed out (well logic, fairness or whatever). I doubt that my pack gets there though.

		Well just make sure you submit it with a screenshot that is very super extra descriptive of your skin/plugin else it will get rejected by Mike the Llama.<br />
<br />
As we all can easily see, the packs displayed at the plugins front page are all very descriptive of the packs... so don't screw up! Otherwise when you search around the forums for other members who have come across this same problem, who were then advised to resubmit it, and you resubmit it to receive a message only 15 minutes later to the same effect as the first, only shorter and much more stern, and then submit your appeal to a thread which was designed and stickied for appealing rejections, only to be told to quit complaining... you will be pretty pissed off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that this happened to me or anything, ya know. Just some friendly advice. :rolleyes:
