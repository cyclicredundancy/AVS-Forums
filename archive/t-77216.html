<div class="posttext">I think this preset rocks, I've got a 3d lava effect, it looks like it's something right outta the movie Spawn. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I'd like to see what the reset of you AVS Freaks can do with it,:rolleyes:.<br />
once you've posted your remix here I start a poll- May the best Remix win. <br />
<br />
Even if you don't want to remix it, take a look, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
PS: It's got a temper- bout 98 bpm works best</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I have to say that your remix preset is very hard to rmx without<br />
doing any radical changes cause it's kind of finnished allready. And<br />
only thing you can add is maybe dynamov.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I guess I can see how that one could be hard to remix. The attached file is the basic set up I started with. If you'll take the time to open it, you'll see, I still can't believe I got that lava effect from the attached preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, it's simple...:D <br />

<div class="posttext">I remixed the original stuff you derived lava stuff from.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Darn it! I forgot to test the AVS by selecting it... please, in the DM, in the Init section, enter this :<br />
<br />
r1=20</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nico1... <br />
I'd have to say your remix is by far the best...  to make it even better... take one of the superscopes and take it off waveform... this will make that &quot;hand&quot; shorter... hence... more clock like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th March 2002, 02:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I tried that, but now the hand is on both sides...<br />
I finally made the hand shorter - and to make it more clock-like, I made the speed of the shorter hand 60 times shorter... heck, I gonna make a Beat-Clock!<br />
<br />
That is, if I can handle myself and not get the hyperactivity fired up again...<br />
<br />
Hmm, let's say we do this together - see who can do it =)<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this code will work :<br />
<br />
OnBeat : t=t-pi/60.<br />
That's for the &quot;seconds&quot; beat hand.<br />
<br />
OnBeat : t=t-pi/360<br />
For the minutes...<br />
<br />
OnBeat : t=t-pi/2160<br />
For the hours.<br />
<br />
And then few other scopes for the whole clock - 1 for the circle, 3 for the hands, and 12 lines on the edges... that's 16.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if pi is a whole rotation of a scope though...<br />
I'll figure it out =)<br />
<br />
I don't exactly know how to make letters/numbers on SSC... sorry...<br />
<br />
EDIT :<br />
<br />
YAY! Got it up to the dots (I mean, I changed it into lines) on the sides of the clock - Only got the easiest down - the 3,6,9, and 12.<br />
Can someone help me on making the others?<br />
<br />
Oh, and correction :<br />
<br />
They're supposed to be :<br />
t=t+pi/30; - seconds<br />
t=t+pi/1800; - minutes<br />
t=t+pi/108000; - hours<br />
<br />
I got the circle and existing side-marks color-morphing.<br />
<br />
So, the parts that I need to finish :<br />
<br />
Sidemarks - 1,2,4,5,7,8,10, and 11 o'clock lines (ouch...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry for accidently forgotten bout this =(<br />
<br />
The markings other than 3,6,9, and 12 are not perfect, but heck, it's kinda close =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">ShoutingMime</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd March 2002, 09:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">*at a loss for words*<br />
**sobbing** and to think I called my preset a clock...<br />
Killer work man... <br />
I'm trying to blend the scopes at the edges where they overlap...<br />
I was thinking it'd look sweet with fog/smoke following the sec hand...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice... I'm impressed.<br />
<br />
If only it were possible to get it to display actual time, that would be a cool way to keep track of how long a song had been playing.:)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't think you can do that in AVS :(</div></div><hr />
