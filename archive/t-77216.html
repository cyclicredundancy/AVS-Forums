      <p class="post-content"><strong>Preset Remix challenge- pyromaniac style</strong><br />
      I think this preset rocks, I've got a 3d lava effect, it looks like it's something right outta the movie Spawn.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, I'd like to see what the reset of you AVS Freaks can do with it,:rolleyes:.<br />
      once you've posted your remix here I start a poll- May the best Remix win.<br />
      <br />
      Even if you don't want to remix it, take a look, it's worth it.<br />
      <br />
      PS: It's got a temper- bout 98 bpm works best</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I agree with Montana</strong><br />
      I have to say that your remix preset is very hard to rmx without<br />
      doing any radical changes cause it's kind of finnished allready. And<br />
      only thing you can add is maybe dynamov.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hmmm, okay, here's and unfinished preset</strong><br />
      I guess I can see how that one could be hard to remix. The attached file is the basic set up I started with. If you'll take the time to open it, you'll see, I still can't believe I got that lava effect from the attached preset.</p>

      I remixed the original stuff you derived lava stuff from.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT : Darn it! I forgot to test the AVS by selecting it... please, in the DM, in the Init section, enter this :<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>A thought</strong><br />
      nico1...<br />
      I'd have to say your remix is by far the best... to make it even better... take one of the superscopes and take it off waveform... this will make that "hand" shorter... hence... more clock like.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hmm....</strong><br />
      I tried that, but now the hand is on both sides...<br />
      I finally made the hand shorter - and to make it more clock-like, I made the speed of the shorter hand 60 times shorter... heck, I gonna make a Beat-Clock!<br />
      <br />
      That is, if I can handle myself and not get the hyperactivity fired up again...<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, let's say we do this together - see who can do it =)<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully, this code will work :<br />
      <br />
      OnBeat : t=t-pi/60.<br />
      That's for the "seconds" beat hand.<br />
      <br />
      OnBeat : t=t-pi/360<br />
      For the minutes...<br />
      <br />
      OnBeat : t=t-pi/2160<br />
      For the hours.<br />
      <br />
      And then few other scopes for the whole clock - 1 for the circle, 3 for the hands, and 12 lines on the edges... that's 16.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure if pi is a whole rotation of a scope though...<br />
      I'll figure it out =)<br />
      <br />
      I don't exactly know how to make letters/numbers on SSC... sorry...<br />
      <br />
      EDIT :<br />
      <br />
      YAY! Got it up to the dots (I mean, I changed it into lines) on the sides of the clock - Only got the easiest down - the 3,6,9, and 12.<br />
      Can someone help me on making the others?<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and correction :<br />
      <br />
      They're supposed to be :<br />
      t=t+pi/30; - seconds<br />
      t=t+pi/1800; - minutes<br />
      t=t+pi/108000; - hours<br />
      <br />
      I got the circle and existing side-marks color-morphing.<br />
      <br />
      So, the parts that I need to finish :<br />
      <br />
      Sidemarks - 1,2,4,5,7,8,10, and 11 o'clock lines (ouch...)</p>

      The markings other than 3,6,9, and 12 are not perfect, but heck, it's kinda close =)</p>

      <p class="post-content">*at a loss for words*<br />
      **sobbing** and to think I called my preset a clock...<br />
      Killer work man...<br />
      I'm trying to blend the scopes at the edges where they overlap...<br />
      I was thinking it'd look sweet with fog/smoke following the sec hand...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice... I'm impressed.<br />
      <br />
      If only it were possible to get it to display actual time, that would be a cool way to keep track of how long a song had been playing.:)<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, I don't think you can do that in AVS :(</p>
