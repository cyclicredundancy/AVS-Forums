<div class="posttext">Will it ever be possible to display a AVS visualization in fullscreen at a higher resolution, from 1024x768 all the way up to 1600x1200? With the quality of graphics cards these days, it would be nice to run a viz fullscreen at a high resolution without skipping frames. Everything out there only runs in low resolutions when played in fullscreen and always has too much black space around the edges or along the sides. I'm probably just being obsessive, but I like to run simple custom made oscilloscope AVS presets in fullscreen a lot and even WA3 has no improvement in the AVS department over WA2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Search the FORUMS!!  This topic has been discussed before.  The AVS for winamp3 is the exact same as for winamp2 except it runs a little slower and is buggier due to the high cpu usage of winamp3.  Graphics cards do almost nothing to avs speed.  The actual processing is done by your computer processor not the graphics card.  The black sides in fullscreen can be removed by going into the avs fullscreen settings and changing the vertical screen height to 100.  Search the FORUMS!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and the reason you can't view it at 1600x1200 is because it's either not available with your adapter or you aren't looking hard enough at the resolution list.  avs is also all processor based, so good graphics cards won't help.<br />
and don't expect anything to come out of the avs wishlist in the next few eternities...</div></div><hr />
