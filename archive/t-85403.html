			<strong>Title display</strong><br />
		
		

		Being relatively new to visualisations, I wonder if someone could give me a bit of advice.<br />
<br />
I have been extremely impressed with the options for AVS settings, but would love to be able to set it so that the title remains on screen rather than fades out. Is this possible or do I need a plugin?<br />
<br />
It would also be great to be able to add, say, for example, the time on screen.<br />
<br />
I have searched the message boards already, but haven't found anything similar.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

		That's just what i wan't, brillent.<br />
<br />
Would i be possible to make it scrolling or colour changing though, i don't want screen burn on my TV...., also the abalilty to change the font and size would be good as well, need at least font size 18 bold on my 36cm TV...:) <br />
<br />
Time on screen would also be good, as well as the song coming next, but perhaps that's too much to ask...
