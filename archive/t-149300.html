<div class="posttext">Ok, I've have searched the forums but theres no specific answer on both on this.<br />
<br />
My comp recently crashed, so after re-installing Winamp 3, I got all the greatest presets and installed them. AVS went all wonky, i always have my presets to load randomly and the load times were just too slow. Does this happen when you've installed too many presets/plugins/APES? Any solution for the loading times between presets? My comp can run them fine, something else is wrong<br />
<br />
Anyway, I uninstalled winamp and deleted all the files in the winamp directory. Re-installed winamp and decided i'd be a bit more careful about which presets I upload. <br />
<br />
So I start up winamp and only the default AVS presets are there: The intro and the Nullsoft folder. But the loading times between are horrendously slow! WTF is wrong?! Does winamp install files in other locations beside the winamp directory?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, i've experienced that also, maybe if you don't use any transition effects it could be faster, but otherwise i don't know where the problem would be... and it's not a wa3 problem either, because i use wa2.81 :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well I've solved the loading problem for now.I think.<br />
<br />
Go to transitions and clear the &quot;Low priority pre-init&quot;. You should notice a difference.<br />
<br />
I still have a feeling I'm gonna have problems when I load mass presets up though.<br />
<br />
Love your work by the way Tuggummi. Downloaded most of your packs, already chucked them on. Haven't caused me any problems...yet :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hehe, glad you like it :)<br />
<br />
Tho i heard that the new AVS version (beta version) makes Bitmapped II look horrible :igor:<br />
<br />
If you still haven't got all my packs, check my sig *hint*hint* ;)</div></div><hr />
