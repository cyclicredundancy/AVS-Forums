			<strong>Community Picks</strong><br />
		
		

		Occassionaly I hear people complaining about the selection of presets in Winamp5. I agree with them though: AVS is one of the cooler standard visualisers in media players, and the standard selection doesn't really show it off. I think it's time we got a 'Community Picks' folder to go along with Winamp5.<br />
<br />
The result should be a collection of 20-30 or so high-quality presets, with varied styles. Technicals are of course allowed, but remember that this pack will be intended for newbies who don't care about lines of code, but visual and soundresponsive quality.<br />
<br />
I'm sure we can get Nullsoft to include it (and otherwise we'll pick out the sexiest AVSer to go seduce a nullsoft employee).<br />
<br />
So here's the plan: 2 phases, 1) selection and 2) voting.<br />
<br />
Everyone picks their <b>5 favourite presets</b> and posts them here, attached as a ZIP file, including <b>all required support files</b> (bitmaps and such). You are allowed to submit your own presets if you want, but be honest with yourself: this is about quality visuals, not egos.<br />
<br />
<b>Check if your preset has already been chosen by another member.</b> If so, there's no point in posting it twice, because we're not voting yet at this stage. Go ahead and pick a replacement preset if you want, or just post less than 5.<br />
<br />
Picking only 5 might be hard, but it's to keep the selection managable.<br />
<br />
It's best to <b>avoid presets which use large images</b>, to keep the total size down. Small texer-bitmaps are no problem of course.<br />
<br />
You may <b>only post your selection once</b>: so think before you pick ;). This is also a good chance to go and download lots of AVS packs and discover new stuff.<br />
<br />
2 weeks from now, the first round is over and I will take all suggested presets, remove the duplicates and put up a vote.<br />
<br />
The exact mechanics of the vote will still have to be decided, but it's probably going to be a points-based vote (like on the Eurovision song contest). You get to hand out the scores 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 to presets. You may only use each score once, and may not give more than one score to a preset.<br />
All scores are added up, and the highest ranking 'n' presets are selected. This system will select out the best presets easily, while still giving lesser presets a good chance at being selected. It also allows people with different first choices, but matching second (or third, fourth, ...) choices, to come to a better compromise.<br />
<br />
Please keep the thread clear of useless posts, and make sure you don't forget your attachment! :rolleyes:

		Can we vote for ourselves? :P<br />
<br />
Lessee...5 favourite presets...that could take a while.  I also get the feeling that there will be way too many people who vote for 5 presets out of Whacko VI/Final Whack (I *hope* that's not what you wanted to get out of this ;) ).  It's a good idea nonetheless.  I'll get around to picking stuff out eventually...or not

		Speaking as the Noob that I am, I think this is a great idea. ;-c ,rattaplan's suggestion would be a great help to us that have little hope of ever coding anything technical. Maybe even breaking the pac into different sections. Eg. Advanced , favorites (whether tech, beat response etc) ,easily manipulated (with comments on how to manipulate {Eg. change # in r=***** to change rotation, change # in d=*** to change distance and so on}). I think this may result in a fewer amount of dumb ass noob questions (me included) that are posted in the forums.

		I didn't bother to include them, since everyone has them anyways ;). I know it's not an original list, but I can't help it, they're simply the best. I will still include one of mine, since I like it a lot.<br />
<br />
1. UnConeD - Final Whack - Seismogrid<br />
2. UnConeD - Final Whack - Tokyo Bullet<br />
3. Tuggummi - Extra Dimension - Let me out!<br />
4. Skupers - Aetherius - Dual Flow<br />
5. Deamon - Fill Rate<br />
<br />
I wonder if I can beat up against the rest to get in the favs pack. I guess it'll be a lot of Final Whack and Tuggummi.<br />
<br />
I kill you of it's your plan to get extra publicity, UnConeD! :p (j/k)

El-Vis - Spindle<br />

Fsk - Teddy<br />

I have included only the ones that have not been posted here, and I think you have the presets you made, UnConeD, so I didn't include them.

		el-vis_rittaufdemfeuerstrahl<br />
<br />
26_Ex_Deux_Mechanica (amphiron)<br />
<br />
UnConeD - FW - 22 - Don't Trip and Drive<br />
<br />
Acid - Twitchy liquid shit (mixing plastics)<br />
<br />
Snowflake Pillow - Convo Trigger         (mine)<br />
<br />
These aren't really favorite top presets (for example, I like Tokyo Bullet and Fragmer's lookitssummer (an outro) a little more than these), but definetly ones that could represent in the pack. Mine isn't an ego thing, but sort of the opposite. I think it looks really cool, but is also not too complex that it would intimidate a possible recruit. Many other presets proposed are great, but would have been very scary for me in the editor until a month or so ago.

		this is NOT the preset forum. this is the &quot;Community Picks&quot; thread. please post your new presets in the &quot;AVS Presets&quot; forum.<br />
if you want to propose presets for the community picks, pick 5 presets, not 18...<br />
<br />
as for me, i'm still choosing presets... there's so many fantastic presets out there it's hard to decide :)

		I think it would be better if each artist would post one or two presets of himself, after which will be decided it will be in the pack. Otherwise there'll almost only be UnConeD's, Tuggummi's and some Skupers presets. This way, much more different artists are able to show some of their work, and you'll get a much more varied pack.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts ;)

		But that are the best presets, it's that simple. I just think it would be nice if other artists would show their work in it as well, but this way, people who don't have the coding skills for it can pack their bags.

i hope this is going to become a real community pack, not just a pack of one of the above. the voting-system could limit the presets-per-artist, so nobody is over- or under-represented.

		Who am I to disagree with shameless self promotion.<br />
Here are my 5 favs in alphabetical order (yes so I could list mine first :P)<br />
<br />
Jheriko - Alien Device (Gallery Remix by Zamuz)<br />
Jheriko - Flourescence<br />
Skupers - The Revenge of Mt. Doom<br />
Tuggummi - Damn Hedrons!<br />
UnConeD - Mister Santa<br />
<br />
I made my choices mostly based on the quality of the visual effect, there were a few really attractive presets that I skimmed over though due to their total lack of reactivity  that I may have otherwise included.

		btw. If presets from ED are going to be selected id like to include the update versions not the old ones.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Deamon, it is still up to you to select the presets. You don't have to select UnConeD's or skupers presets just, because the majority thinks they are the best. I myself am only going to vote only for one UnConeD's preset, because that's the only one i think that should be included.<br />
So quit blaming yourself for not being able to select other than UnConeD's presets :igor:<br />

		My top-5:<br />
<br />
Is the order important? in that case:<br />
<br />
1) UnConeD - Daedalus<br />
2) Tuggummi - Orb Of Destruction<br />
3) El-Vis - Virus<br />
4) Alchemist - Electric Laserland ('Inside Laserland' according to comment)<br />
5) El-Vis - Golden<br />
<br />
Okay, that's my list. It's only a few words, but it took quite a few hours to dig through the presets I have...<br />
Now it's done, I notice that these are only quite simple (D)movement-based presets and no render-base presets, which somehow surprises me.<br />
All presets are attached.

You have no idea how long it took me to pick these out :S<br />
<br />
my picking is based on:<br />
-they respond to the music well<br />
-they run fast(fps)<br />
-they are pretty lookin'<br />
-there isn't 50 identical presets out there that I could have picked instead.<br />
<br />
<b><br />
zamuz - explosive virus<br />
NemoOrange - Implode Explode <br />
degnic - fractal (slow-mo metallic) <br />
Degnic - Fury (extreme remix by fsk)<br />

		FIRST POST in WINAMP FORUMS!!!<br />
<br />
Okay, I've posted here because I'm a big fan of AVS.<br />
I've seen presets almost as early as 1999.<br />
Well, here are my top 5 favorites:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Degnic - Data Flow<br />
2) Shock Value - Grafitti<br />
3) UnconeD - All Neon-Like<br />
4) El-VIS - Digitalistbesser<br />
5) Tuggummi - Sound Rings<br />
<br />
<br />
I decided to pick only 1 from an artist so that<br />
I won't look like a fanboy of a particular person.<br />
The presets I chose above are based from my experience<br />
and took me awhile because it's really hard to decide.<br />
Almost every preset i've seen today are visually stunning.

		I decided to use some more unknown presets. It was extra difficult because I already have to pick a lot of favourite presets (Deskmod series) and I didn't want to repeat myself.<br />
<br />
les Noobiens - das kaffeeservice (zamuz pretty rmx)<br />
nixa - baptism by fire<br />
tuggummi - guingtsing<br />
nemoorange - spiriel<br />
tonic - zoomed picture from one insect<br />
<br />
And thanks to everyone that picked one of my presets. I really appreciate it.

		My picks...<br />
<br />
Tuggummi - Chrome Deluxe (best chrome preset)<br />
<br />
Unripelemon - Nectar (stylish flow preset with a lot of depth: seems to jump out of the AVS window)<br />
<br />
fšk - ice cube (weird colors and stylized response, an old favorite)<br />
<br />
Tuggummi + Jheriko - No way out remix (sweet 3D DM with sweet texture)<br />
<br />
fšk - afterburner remix (This preset pwnz, with a 'p').<br />
<br />
(I originally had Degnic - Dataflow, but that's was already picked)

Let's say May 7th as final selection deadline. I will put up the vote then.

		was also wondering, if <i>architectural design</i> preset is something meant for the end-consumer. i like it a lot, but it's nothing for viewing pleasure only.

		The only thing that bugs me about architectural design is that most of the help is inside the comments. There should be a mention of holding 'h' for help on the first screen.<br />
<br />
Anyway, voting will decide :P.

		Surely the purpose of the pack is the purpose that the whole community gives it? If everyone contributes what *they* want then we will end up with a good representation of the community's favorite presets, for whatever reason they are considered so great.

Well I'm too lazy too read the rest of these two pages :rolleyes: :D  so I don't know if anyone mentioned me at all (probably not), But that kinda sounds like my kind of presets....  I think something like &quot;celesetial wind&quot; would fall into that category.  <br />
<br />
But if I'm the only one who thinks that I'll shut up ;)

		Here's a slightly improved version of Architectural Design with the text UnConeD suggested and a couple of extra reminders in the Top Down Designer. Hopefully this should point non-AVSers in the right direction if this preset gets voted in. (The zip also contains the AddBorders APE and two images that are all needed to view the preset correctly.)<br />
<br />
Now to figure out what my five picks will be...

		As you can see, this selection is pretty special, because only one preset is an original one,the others are remixes.<br />
It seemed really hard to select, but after i read the post <br />
i found most of my favs already submitted :),that made the process a LOT easier :D.<br />
<br />
So my five favourites are : <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;AVS-King vs. Evilrice : High Tech ( Shards of Glass mix)<br />
&gt;&gt;Skupers vs. Degnic : Spirit Realm (Plasmoid remix) <br />
&gt;&gt;El-Vis : VR26 (orb)<br />
&gt;&gt;Nemo vs. El-vis : Dreamtime 2 remix <br />
&gt;&gt;Acid vs. Tuggummi : Twitchy Liquid Shit (mixing plastics)

		My picks:<br />
<br />
fsk - digital artist<br />
shock value - source of power (I had to include <i>one</i> of mine :) )<br />
skupers - dual flow<br />
tuggummi - multiple orgasms<br />
zamuz meets tuggummi - fat balls (wallpaper wannabe candy theme)<br />
<br />
It's hard to define what &quot;best&quot; is or even what my favorites are, but I think these presets represent various styles of AVS well.

<br />
zamuz - bing bang (first I picked 'rough n smooth' from zamuz but I think this got better response..)<br />

nemoorange - the light of speed (first thought of building blocks but since it's mentioned already...still a fab preset)<br />
<br />
tuggummi - shiny metal curves (so many great presets from tug.. I decided to stick with this, hypersexy and smooth preset)<br />
<br />
unconed - silk strings (very responsive + looks very good)
