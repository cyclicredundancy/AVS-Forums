<div class="posttext">I swear I did a search on this and checked the troubleshooting and greatest hits.  Please help.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to see what all this AVS stuff is all about, but since I don't have a camera, all I get for the visualization are trippy variants of 'Camera not found or failed to initialize'.  I tried unchecking the 'enable irisape ' box in the configuration, but there's no way to save your choices when you close the box.  It has no effect.  I still just get this annoying message along with Sy Fi and a darned finger pointing somewhere.  I'd really appreciate some help here.  Thanks.<br />

...Camera?<br />

Uh, no, I don't think we're talking about the right kind of AVS here. AVS, or &quot;Advanced Visualization Studio&quot;, is a WinAmp plug-in that generates interesting visual displays based on the music that's currently being played in WinAmp. This has nothing at all to do with any kind of camera, webcam, or other video input. If WinAmp is giving you a &quot;Camera not found&quot; message for some bizarre reason, there must be some other plug-in (but not one I'm familiar with) that's causing it.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could try asking your question elsewhere on the WinAmp forums (http://forums.winamp.com/index.php).<br />
<br />
(...This is assuming you're even using Winamp, and haven't been steered in the wrong direction by a Yahoo search.)<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well im not familiar with Sy Fi's irisape, but i just downloaded and installed it for a test and found out that there should be a uninstaller on your winamp\plugins\avs folder simply called &quot;uninst.exe&quot; (it asks you first if you're really sure you want to uninstall the irisape), if you can't find the uninstaller then just try and locate &quot;IrisAPE.ape&quot; (again in your winamp\plugins\avs folder) and delete that, that should remove your problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oops. I stand corrected.<br />
<br />
Just when I thought AVS couldn't get more surprising, someone finds a way to add video capture (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/15957720/) to it?<br />
<br />
I guess I should've seen that coming... but still... Camera!?</div></div><hr />
