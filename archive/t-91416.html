			<strong>Looking for Plug-In</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi. I had to format my harddrive a while back, and with it I lost my Visulisation stuff... I can't remember what it was called, but I know that one of the presets was called 'Make it stop!'. It's 2 balls going round and round in time with the beat. Yeah, doesn't sound like much, but it's pretty cool...<br />
<br />
Can ne1 put the link here?

		OK do you mean AVS presets or another plug-in entirely?<br />
<br />
I presume you mean AVS so moving to the AVS forums. They will be able to help you better.

		Ok no problem mate.:)<br />
<br />
I'll start agian.<br />
<br />
The pretty pics or visualizations are all forms of plug-ins (additional bits bolted onto winamp).<br />
<br />
One of these comes with winamp.<br />
<br />
It is called AVS - Advanced Visualization Studio.<br />
<br />
TO get to this and other plug-ins right click on winmap and select Visualizations ans then select Select Plug-in.<br />
<br />
Then choose the one you want.<br />
<br />
Ok you can download additional effects for AVS called presets from the WA or around these forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you remember what you selected to get you 'two balls' plug-in/preset? If it was AVS then you would have to go into more submenus to select the one you wanted. If you didn't do this it probably wasn't an AVS presets it was probably another plug-in.<br />
<br />
Other plugin like at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/" target="_blank">www.winamp.com/plugins/</a> can be downloaded and installed and selected in the above way.<br />
<br />
If it is a plug-in I cannot thing what you mean maybe it is Scope 4d.<br />
Search for it.<br />
<br />
For the time being try some of these <br />
<br />
<a href="http://r2.rabidhamster.com" target="_blank">r2extreme v1.54</a> <a href="http://www.milkdrop.co.uk" target="_blank">MilkDrop v1.03b3</a> <br />
<br />
Or for quailty avs presets (these will appear inside the AVS plug-in) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/browse.jhtml?categoryName=AVS+presets" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/plugins/browse...me=AVS+presets</a> anything by UnConed, El-Vis, Tonic will be good.<br />
<br />
So was you plug-in/preset an AVS one or a seperate plug-in.<br />
<br />
If you think it was AVS then I will leave this thread here, if not I will move it to the plug-in forums so people can hopefully help out.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
*Phew*

		thanks... sounds like an AVS... It had sub-menus from the configure screen where I could select the one I wanted... I've been through the plug-in page in WA and downloaded a couple... didn't like very much... *sigh* Thanks for trying to help :) Oh well, I'll just have to search the net till I find someting...<br />
<br />
&quot;The 'net is vast and infinite&quot; :eek:
