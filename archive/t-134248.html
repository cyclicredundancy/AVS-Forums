		mmm, interesting pack. I liked most of it but i think you went a little overboard on that whole solid flowing DM effect. Don't get me wrong i really like it i just think you used it in a few too many presets. Great work on most of them. Favroutes were knitting and mind the mind. Overall its a nice pack, very original. Nice work :)

		A little too abstract for my taste. Squares only do so much for me.

			<strong>Yay!  A Installer I can actually open!</strong><br />
		
		

		Cool Stuff!  I still don't get how you can make presets from trans effects.  Every time I try to do it, I get a blank screen no matter what!

i never asked skupers about the actual meaning of the pack's name, but i guess you're right, nemo.

		Was bored so....here goes...<br />
<i>Intro X</i> - Nothing very special in it, allright.<br />
<br />
<i>Graphite</i> - The dm, especially the alpha-blend is good. Also looks good when the invert is placed after everything :).<br />
<br />
<i>Matmosx</i> - Looks better without the d=d/2 movement, but I dont like the preset a lot.<br />
<br />
<i>Xorange</i> - Now this interleave thing is getting sorta bring and looks ugly at far off distances. Some alpha-blending to hide the ugly this is needed. :igor:<br />
<br />
<i>Tensionx</i> - Nice use of XOR blend :D<br />
<br />
<i>Graphitex</i> - Looks very good without the last Unique-Tone.  Otherwise not so nice.<br />
<br />
<i>Radiumsx</i> - I dont like this, very repetetivie.<br />
<br />
<i>Knitting</i> - Now, this is a cool preset :) i like the glow effect in the background.<br />
<br />
<i>Tendrilx</i> - No, dont like it :(<br />
<br />
<i>Usarx</i> - Another boring preset.<br />
<br />
<i>Euphorian</i> - Definately better than many of the presets.<br />
<br />
<i>Mind the mind</i> - The square pattern is cool. Very original idea.<br />
<br />
<i>Txorx</i> - AQnother good use of XOR. Looks cooler when the dm is after the effect list.<br />
<br />
<i>Tequilax</i> - Add an invert at the end! This way it looks far better.<br />
<br />
<i>xxexx</i> - I like the different patterns created and the way the screen fills up in beetween. :up: :D<br />
<br />
<i>txorrx</i> - Could have used Color-Map OR Dynamic Clear Screen (see signature) to get fast and varied colors. If you use DCS then select invert+additive blend.<br />
<br />
<i>Lux eternarx</i> Looks better withou the z=0.5+d;d=d/z; movement. Great water effect. :) The ripples formed are cool.<br />
<br />
Overall I would give <i>3.5</i>. Some presets are good, but I dont like many of them. I guess the <b>ONLY TRANS EFFECTS</b> is overdone in this pack. The interleave effect sometimes looks ugly. Using tons of trans effects sucks up the fps. :(<br />
<br />
My best presets are : knitting and graphite (no x)<br />
Dont be disappointed by my review, perhaps I dont have a taste for such presets.<br />
btw. can I get the script of the installer? I wanted to use ModernUI for future installer of mine.

		Thanks for the review. No, I'm not disappointed by your review. You can think whatever you like. You have to understand that I'm happy if other people like my presets too, but it's not that important. Oh, and Xorange was made for the &quot;ugly&quot; interleave effect, which I think looks kind of cool.<br />
<br />
The installer script was created by yathosho (aka. killahbite on these forums), so you have to ask him.
