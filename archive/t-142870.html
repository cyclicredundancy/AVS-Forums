		I don't like the way that you're demanding for us to fix it.  That's &quot;fucken annoying&quot;.<br />
<br />
By freezes do you mean that the AVS temporarily stops running until you choose a new preset or click out of the menu, or the program freezes up?<br />
<br />
If it's the first, then too bad - AVS is going to do that on your computer.<br />
<br />
If it's the second, then it may be because you have downloaded too many presets - I know it did this to me when I had a ton of presets(over 2000).  It may be something else too, though.  Dunno.

		Anubis - seeing as how he didn't know how to spell common words like &quot;freezes,&quot; &quot;fucking,&quot; and &quot;either&quot; I'm guessing that he's ESL, so would you mind pulling the stick out of your ass for us?  Thanks.

		On Winamp 2.x, AVS' <i>sound input</i> does freeze whenever certain events occur. E.g.<br />
- When loading a new preset<br />
- While dragging the AVS editor<br />
- While accessing the AVS editor menu's<br />
- While dragging a component inside a preset<br />
- While clicking &quot;Load Example&quot; for scopes<br />
<br />
I assume this person means the menu-bar at the top of the editor (what other 'drop-down' menu is there?). Wow, a whopping 0.0001% of the total time spent with AVS is spent inside the menu bar.<br />
<br />
It probably has something to do with how Winamp 2.x threads plugins.<br />
<br />
Funny though, if you make presets that freeze completely when this happens, then you should try making them slightly more interesting.

		Anubis - I do recall one of Rova's reasons for not making me an AVS reviewer is that I flame(d) so much.  So if I were you I'd be the one doing the shutting up of the fuck.<br />
<br />
UnConeD - I think he's talking about the right-click preset selection menu; although this really doesn't make any sense because if you're going to load a new preset...then...well...I think you see my point.  In all honesty it's rather useful to be able to freeze AVS input from time to time.
