      <p class="post-content"><strong>AxisMap query with Barchart</strong><br />
      I've got an application that reads in 7 columns of data. The first 5 are strings and the last 2 are doubles (with 0 in each row).<br />
      I'm creating a 2d barchart and am adding the last 2 columns to my bar chart component. As I'm adding two series I'm also using a combineAxisMap component to get my total range on my Y axis. My individual axis map components each have there startValue set to 0, and I have set my combined axis map min value to 0 as well.<br />
      <br />
      However my barchart insists on going from -1 to 1 (even with the cross over value set at 0 See picture). If i set my nullvalues on my tablemapper then I manage to remove my bars from the scene (which I want) but my Y axis still goes from -1 to 1.<br />
      <br />
      Q - how do I get around this problem?<br />

      <p class="post-content">BTW - an easy way to see this is to run up the barchart1 example. Change one of the data arrays to have zeros in and just add this using the newseries method.(not exactly the same code as I'm using but this seems to indicated a problem with the barchart component)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Eerm, I don't think this is the right place to ask your question. This forum is dedicated to AVS presets, not Excel bars.<br />
      <br />
      But I'll try to answer your question: I suppose you want them to go from 0 to 1? Then just divide it by two and add 0.5</p>
