<div class="posttext">How do you get AVS´s beat detection system to properly &quot;detect&quot; beats coming from Line In? I own a Creative Extigy SB (connects via USB).<br />
<br />
Which plug-in (or plug-ins) should I use? <br />
<br />
How should these be configured, providing I am only interested in beat detection rather than hi-fi sound?<br />
<br />
Are there any other winamp configuration issues I should have in mind for AVS´s beat detection to work with Line-in?<br />
<br />
Help is highly appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you use Line-in, you won't be able to use the &quot;advanced&quot; beat detection. It attemps to detect the beat of the song and once it gets a close enough approximation, it locks into that beat. When the next song is played, it resets again. However, when using line-in, AVS will think it's still one song playing, so it will never re-detect the beat. Standard isn't bad though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Use a the low-latency output plug-in and an advanced input plug-in for getting a decent line-in from you hi-fi mixer, etc.<br />
<br />
From http://home.hccnet.nl/th.v.d.gronde/<br />
<br />
And with the MilkDrop vis (see sig) you can define your own beat detection. ANd even with the 30ms (or whatever) delay for line it will look spot on for live shows etc. One area where it has a big plus over AVS.<br />
<br />
All info on the boards.<br />

LOL why don't people use it then?<br />
<br />
I suppose it is impossible to get good beat detection at 8fps. ;) :D :p <br />
<br />
(:o Ignore me today I am just be overly argumentative. :) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Because AVS's built-in beat-detection is already pretty good?<br />
Anyway tell me, why are you trying to convert AVSers to Milkdrop? You don't see us trying to convert Milkdroppers to AVS...<br />
<br />
Only losers allow their puny little souls to be damned by those cheap, hardware accelerated visuals that Milkdrop presets. Real men use the CPU!<br />
<br />
Mwahahahahahahahaha!!<br />
*runs off in a frenzy of mad, AVS induced schizofrenia*</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">First of all, MilkDrop don't work for me...<br />
<br />
And now, to defend AVS...<br />
<br />
First of all, MilkDrop have 3d acceleration, AVS don't...<br />
But...<br />
The top AVS artists here made impressive 3d environment with it! And it's all using only 2D capabilities! Who's more skilled now?<br />
<br />
And heck, like UnConeD say, we use CPU - I don't have 3d accelerated video card - that means MilkDrop don't work for me - A downside.<br />
Since I don't plan on getting new games soon, Ain't gonna spend lotsa bux just to use MilkDrop...<br />
<br />
And last of all, AVS is Nullsoft created.<br />
<br />
(Another thing : I don't think you can configure MilkDrop Preset and get a Live representation on what's been done on the screen... the configuration box can't edit aspects (Renders and stuff) the presets itself [Or it's just my lack of 3d card...])<br />
<br />
______________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Ok, back to the topic...<br />
<br />
The only time AVS is going to get a decent beat detection is to wait until them (kinda) lazy Nullsoft staffs to improve AVS... or you can just give them time to work on Winamp 3.0 - Not alpha or Beta version... (but I don't wait for new Winamp stuffs... the AVS is what hooked me :) )<br />
<br />
Hopefully, that might help...</div></div><hr />

You put up a great defence Nic. ;):p<br />

<div class="posttext">This topic should never be locked :)... Rovastar and me have these kinds of fun discussions all the time: we're just poking fun at eachother. I respect the Milkdrop community just as much as they respect the AVS community.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway it seems some of the younger initiates are ill-informed in the intricate details of our grand plans. Tell me Obi-Wan Rovastar, how do you expect to paddle against the stream of the giant river? Old as this man may be, his spirit is still clear enough to see through the gaping holes in your false promises. MilkDrop offers only a glimpse of the true zen of Visualisation. Stay with your false deity! But don't expect us to save you from the clutches of hell when your soul ends up damned for eternity! A man chooses his own path, and your ill choice will cost you dearly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah right, like us MD people ever respect the AVS community :D ;) :blah: <br />
<br />
You must realise, Rova, that Unconed may never reach the nirvana of visualisations, but is satisified with the one who is of the false teachings. All in good time, and he too will join with those who know the real truth, not that false deity which is concealed in AVS<br />
<br />
:D :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tell me Illusion, do you do anything else but mimic thy enemies' words and warp them to your own deranged goals? Anyone who has studied the Zen of Visualisation can feel the bad aura eminating from MilkDrop. Tell me my dearest... why are you discussing this in our place of meditation?<br />
Only a false god needs tricks to gain followers: It's obvious that you are slaves to the whip of Geiss, which in turn has forced you to suck others into the same pit of eternal damnation. Thankfully, those that are pure of heart will not fall to your lowly attempts of corruption. You are mearly anoter test of temptation on the path to spiritual balance...<br />

<br />
Now to think of a even wittier &amp; funnier reply, which will show up AVS in all of its (lack of) glory ;) :D <br />
<br />
And yeah, nic01, it might not be exactly the right place for this, but never mind, this way you can have some light entertainment as you look to solve your AVS problems :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanx for the advise on &quot;line in + beat detection&quot; (remember? the original topic?).<br />
<br />
I can't believe how fast you guys went OT . (No disrespect, though)<br />
<br />
On Milk Drop, all I have to say is: - nothing -  ; AVS is just one of the most powerful and flexible tools I have found yet. It coulb be faster, though, but that sort of thing should be spoken of in the &quot;AVS Wishlist&quot; forums.<br />
<br />
Thanks again. If anyone else has something to say about getting the most out of AVS's beat detection, I'm all ears.</div></div><hr />
