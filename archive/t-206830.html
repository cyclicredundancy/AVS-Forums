<div class="posttext">LOL forums have changed so much since I've checked in.  I just wanted to let you all know I'm working for a mobile disk jockey company called The Wave.  It is quite an amazing production (a killer light &amp; sound show...at a student council convention he had 8 cerwin vega earthquake speakers, like 6 JBL concert speakers---well over $100,000 worth of sound &amp; lights, not to mention 2 HUGE video projection screens (I know they were at least 15 feet).  I was not with the company at the time---it was before I started.  My job is to run the video/visuals---and I'd been trying to talk to my boss about using AVS instead of windows media player visuals...and he's the sort that is always hesitant to try new stuff b/c it might screw up the old stuff or somethin...that was early on in my work with the comapny, but after a little while he decided to put me in charge of video etc. at our larger shows (well for weddings, a huge video screen projecting AVS doesn't quite fit lol)...anyways the other weekend I worked a large show &amp; did video.  Let me say that my boss is not one to give complements hardly at all--for the most part he's critical of most stuff.  <br />
<br />
anyways he calls me with some ideas &amp; stuff he wants me to work on &amp; he's like hey sorry I didn't get to tell you sooner, you know how busy we all were at the show &amp; how tired we were when we got back...but I saw what you had going on the screen...and that was quite impressive.  :D  Well I couldn't help but notice all the girls who wanted to take a picture in front of the video screen (we were reverse projecting it...from behind the screen; it's a dual-surface one so it shows on both sides).<br />
<br />
Anyways, I haven't been in for a while, but if anybody's got a collection of nice VJ presets I could use, I'd most appreciate it.  <br />
<br />
I suppose I could say I'm a VJ now :D<br />
<br />
I'm out<br />
<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">what kind of presets are you looking for? tuggummi, pak-9 and unconed make some very good presets, but there are many more.<br />
i've made some presets myself, but i'd understand if you didn't want to use them.<br />
I'd look on deviantart.com for more artists. Most of the people here hace accounts there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What specifically makes an AVS good for VJ'ing? Lots of my presets have mouse control in them which I'd imagine is a bit of a no-no, but of course you can use my presets if you want. 99% of people are happy for you to show their work at parties and gigs because thats a lot of the point of AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pak 9 posses a good question.  To the shows I've been to that use visuals, they are all looking more for the good scenes and whatnot that actually have little response to the music.<br />
<br />
Then again, I've been to clubs that use some sort of responsive visualization.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try BeatHarness (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=208502), it's a sort-off automated VJ.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd say use mine, but they suck and aren't finished. Nice job getting a VJ gig. I've VJ'd a couple times, but not anything serious. It's pretty fun :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think for my next pack I'm going to have 2 versions, one with mouse control and one not, so people can use the non-mouse control version for vj'ing clubs &amp; whatnot if they like</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">PAK-9, pardon me, but that sounds like a really dumb idea. I mean, couldn't people who want to use them for VJ'ing just ignore the interactivities? :igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2005, 21:11</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yea that would like great, a big 100ft screen with a visualisation running and slowly an interactivity menu fades into view becuase they moved the mouse. You can try and make it so that mouse control stuff doesnt appear in fullscreen but there is not robust solution to that problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2005, 21:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">If you're wondering about dual-screen set-ups, why not just make the menu fade in if(mouseonAVSscreen,true,false) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2005, 21:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I do do that, but it will still appear when people go over the AVS window to right click and pick a preset, or double click to get the editor, or just by accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2005, 21:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Why would they go over the AVS window anyway? I mean if someone seriously considers using AVS for VJ'ing they would probably use Hotlist or the likes.</div></div><hr />

Why would they go over the AVS window anyway?Because people are STUPID! Jeez, dont you know anything. Believe me, you have to make it as simple as possible or people will fuck it up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, i forgot teh stupid pee-poe :(<br />
<br />
They would have to know about WinAmp<br />
They would have to know about AVS<br />
They would have to know about VJ'ing<br />
They would probably search for info on tools like hotlist<br />
<br />
But their still stupid! :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">there is a solution for the interface thing. UCD made an ape for it for this very reason (on screen ui sux:)) he hasnt put it on line anywhere so ill put it here (maybee its in his dump havent looked).<br />
<br />
this is also uber usefull if you are to lazy to code your own ui:D + the settings get saved with the preset:)<br />
<br />
Coned, thx again for makeing this.</div></div><hr />
