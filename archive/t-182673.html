		Ok I know most of you feel that text is like... not AVS.. which is ok but...<br />
<br />
Just watch my karaoke show OK?  Watch how I use AVS.  If I could input txt from IRC into avs, that would totally rock the karaoke show.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, I'd still like too be able too show a playlist in txt.  That would rock too.<br />
<br />
i'm askin for more text render functionality. Maybe add support for IPC messages in AVS. I dunno, I smoke dope so maybe im high.

		I can see why would you want this, but since you are a pretty limited category of users that would find it useful, i doubt it ever happen (i doubt avs will be even updated ever again for that matter...)<br />
But i hear a lot of people blend &quot;streams&quot; together, why couldn't you do this? For example have a avs preset run in the back and blend the text source from some other application on top of it?<br />
Now i don't have any clue as to how this can be done, but i've heard it's done quite often by the Vj's.

		I know there's a million different ways I could VJ something together, but i'm just askin for this too be added too the wishlist.  That's all.  Give a programmer some way too use it and I'm sure it's going to get used.

		its doable through ape, im sure...<br />
apperantly this ape must be coded by person who really really needs it, so...<br />
<br />
i hope william hung will become a great singer soon :p<br />
ofcourse this can be added to wishlist but its not likely that avs will ever get updated anyways

		@jaak Please don't say that. If we're all expecting that there won't be any updates, threre sure won't be any.<br />
<br />
@t0ger and yes, an APE could do this so I suggest you start learning C++ soon :p
