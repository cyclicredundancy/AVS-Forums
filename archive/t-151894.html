		Hey everyone, you don't know me, I've never posted. But I've browsed the Winamp website since Winamp 2 first came out.  Always wanted to get into AVS but never had the time.  Found some time so heres my first attempt.  Tell me what you think.

		Very n00bish, but that's pretty much what anyone would expect for a first time.  Keep playing and learning AVS, there are many helpful resources such as Atero's AVS Primer, UnConeD's FAQ thread, and etc. which you could check out.  <br />
<br />
Welcome to the AVS community! :)

		Kinda n00bish indeed, but keep it up. Look around a lot here, and you should get better fast :).<br />
<br />
And a very nice welcome from me too.
