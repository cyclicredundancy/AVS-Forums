      Okay, after having been away for about half a year, i'm not really up to date which APE's currently exist.<br />
      <br />
      Could you all post your APE's here, so we would get an APE Collection (there already was one but i think its outdated now)</p>

      <p class="post-content">There is a big APE collecting thread.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and as an APE author I'm AGAINST repackaging APEs because you lose readme's and stuff.<br />
      <br />
      For example, I do NOT wish to provide support for AVSGrabber, but I still keep getting emails about it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I respect your point of view but look, if we include all the docs and credits and maybe even a link file to the developpers site, it could accessed more quickly than downloading everything seperately.<br />
      <br />
      Furthermore i can't see a diffrence in wheter you publish your APE's in your Packs or repacked in a large collection (in the way i mentioned above).<br />
      <br />
      Btw: I'm a programmer myself, i know that stuff is redistributed by Users, that's why i never published AVS-Packs or Hotlist 2 although i already added stuff like language packs. I only publish things that i WANT peopel to use.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That'll all be going out in my AVS Resource Pack when I'm done with AVS Primer 1.0.9.<br />
      <br />
      (And I'll include all docs that I can find, don't worry)</p>
