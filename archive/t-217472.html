			<strong>Mandelbrots and Other Fractals</strong><br />
		
		

		Anyone who doesn't know the procedure used to draw Mandelbrot fractals, go on with your lives or look it up ;)<br />
<br />
I've written a Mandelbrot generation engine in AVS and I need some ideas on how to speed it up, short of rewriting it as an APE. Currently it works in three sections.<br />
<br />
The first figures out the position on screen for the next plotted point, as well as it's size. This works to continually increase the quality the longer it's left running.<br />
<br />
The second figures out the actual colour of the pixel. Because of the itterative nature of the Mandelbrot set, this is done with a whole superscope to get the right number of itterations, just for 1 pixel.<br />
<br />
The third takes the details from the first two through the global megabuffer and actually draws the damn thing.<br />
<br />
Now, what I'm wondering is how to speed it up. My first version drew 1 pixel per frame using 3 components. My current version draws 32 pixels per frame using 96 components. Is there any way I can get more than one pixel out of a component set? Is there some hidden itterative procedure I could use that I'm just too crappy a programmer to actually find?<br />
<br />
The actual engine is at <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18766376/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18766376/</a><br />
<br />
An image it produced is at <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18766170/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18766170/</a><br />
<br />
It has a problem with the screen size changing mid render and has to be manually reinitialised at the moment. I'm working on that.

		A superscope is by definition a loop for 'n' points. You can also use the loop() construct to loop within code. See the Expression Help inside AVS itself for usage examples.<br />
<br />
It's not designed for variable-length loops, but you can achieve them with some hacks. It's a trade-off between loop nesting and wasted iterations.

		The mandelbrot code looks something like this outside of AVS:<br />
<br />
cb = (something)<br />
cbi = (something else)<br />
maxitt = (maximum number of itterations)<br />
repeat(<br />
      itt = itt + 1;<br />
      olda = a;<br />
      a = (a * a) - (b * b) + ca;<br />
      b = (2 * olda * b) + cbi;<br />
      lz = sqr(a) + sqr(b);<br />
      )<br />
until (lz =&gt; 4) or (itt = maxitt)<br />
output = itt<br />
<br />
I wasted an hour trying to figure out how to use a <br />
loop/if/exec2 combination to do this, but it didn't work. I'd either need an exec5 command or nested exec statements. I reread Pak-9's guide concerning exec2 statements. Am I right in thinking they can't be nested? Is there any way I can get that section of code in the repeat brackets executed in it's entirety in a single statement?

		if you want to write code nested in loops, you might want to use this APE:<br />

loop/if/exec can be nested<br />
<br />
<br />
exec2(assign(t, x), exec2(assign(x,y),assign(y,t))); <br />
is perfectly valid and is actually exactly same as:<br />
t = x;<br />
x = y;<br />
y = t;

		A-ha! Thankyou very much, I must have had some syntax error or something when I tried it ;) Thanks for the reassurance :D
