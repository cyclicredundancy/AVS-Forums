      <p class="post-content"><strong>Begging for a plugin again</strong><br />
      Not sure if this would be the right way of going about it but..<br />
      <br />
      I've been begging for a way to display the current playlist in AVS. I've been looking at the imagemagik, and noticed it has a text renderer.<br />
      <br />
      So could someone write me a plugin using imagemagik that will render a bmp that has the 1st 3 titles in the playlist into c:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs dir?<br />
      <br />
      Just make it stupid simple, and have it assume that I have convert, and all those other nifty imagemagic programs in the file path.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><a href="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/graphics/imagick6/annotating/#practical" target="_blank">This</a> is an example of what I was talking about... Except you would get the label data from the winamp playlist. This is <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">imagemagick</a> right here.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know if using imagemagick would be the right thing to use, but if I could get a BMP in the avs directory with the first 3 items in the playlist, that would rock.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the problem with that is, that Picture II creates a working image in memory if you<br />
      a) change resolution,<br />
      b) on init<br />
      or c) when selecting another image<br />
      this means it doesnt read that text from the HD every frame<br />
      <br />
      Try making a bitmap font instead... it could be used by an APE to draw text i think...</p>

      </blockquote>Yah, sort of a preset.. That's the way I was planning on using it..Preset would look like..<br />
      <br />
      render&gt;bmp<br />
      c:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs\dynamictxt1.bmp<br />
      <br />
      All imagemagic would do is put the text(playlist) into the BMP.<br />
      <br />
      It could be used for more than playlist stuff though.. like IRC txt &gt; bmp.<br />
      <br />
      ACDC wouldn't work for this either, it's not free, its not command line, ect.

      <p class="post-content">DynamicMovement did you even read the imagemagick page?<br />
      <br />
      now i know what you mean :)<br />
      you want to have imagemagick generate a pic of the playlist and then load it into AVS.<br />
      interesting idea, but this method has 2 problems:<br />
      1st:<br />
      say you have a playlist with 1400 entries.<br />
      now fit that into the AVS screen ;)<br />
      <br />
      2nd:<br />
      the playlist might change during the runtime of the preset</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well for me, and karaoke, i maybe only have 20 or so people in my playlist at a time...<br />
      <br />
      I'd just like to grab the first 3 entries or so..<br />
      <br />
      But yah, you get the general idea tommy, sure it's cludgy and ugly, but until the avs text render has more options for getting extended playlist info this was the only solution i could think of... Can you code it for me?</p>

      <p class="post-content">what you want is not possible with the imagemagick//render picture method you describe<br />
      <br />
      read the 2nd problem above ;)<br />
      i think your playlist WILL change very often ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">What t0qer needs is the following:<br />
      A gen plugin(or external program) to monitor for playlist changes. When/if the playlist changes AND after each song finishes, the plug or prog will generate a new bmp using the imagemagick lib, feeding it the text of next three playlist items following the currently playing entry. AVS will just be the display for the bmp.<br />
      <br />
      The goal is for t0qer to show bar patrons upcoming songs from within an already-running AVS session, therefore he knows when the preset will run (by manually invoking it) and he knows when the playlist will change(because he'll be adding to it as people sign up).<br />
      <br />
      Is that a correct assessment of the situation?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ya thats a great assesment gonzo. Thanks buddy :D Ya it doesn't even have to automatically run when there's a playlist change, even if it's just a single floating button "render bmp" that I pressed once in a while, that would be fine.<br />
      <br />
      But automatic would be nice :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nudge, that gets the current playlist item, not the first on the list. And besides it is clear that isn't the thing he wants at all :)<br />
      <br />
      If there won't be any solution to this you could always hire a monkey to take your screenshots and display them in avs manually :p</p>
