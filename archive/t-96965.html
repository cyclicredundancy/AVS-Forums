<div class="posttext">Hey there. It has occured to me that while some AVSers use simple rotations around 3 planes to obtain our 3d SSs and DMs, UnConeD and others use a mystical force called &quot;raytracing.&quot; I did a search on Google, and I came up with a lot of programs, but not a lot of information on how this works.<br />
From what I gather, raytracing traces a line from the observer out to the world until it hits something. Well that's all fine and dandy, but how do you actually DO that?<br />
AVS-Masters, if you don't mind sharing your secrets of success, or at least posting a link that has some good material to read, it'd be much appriciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="posttext">The basic concept of raytracing is not hard...<br />
<br />
First you need a way to describe a ray that starts at the point (ox, oy, oz) and points in the direction (dx, dy, dz). Then you can describe any point on this ray by:<br />
<br />
(k*dx+ox, k*dy+oy, k*dz+oz) where k is any positive real number.<br />
<br />
By filling this is in equations for shapes (plane, sphere, cylinder, ...) and solving for k, you can find the intersection point. Then you need to calculate a texture coordinate based on that point.<br />
<br />
Raytracing works nicely for DM's, but for a superscope it's much too slow. You can get pretty complex shapes like this, but the problem is that a DM has a very low resolution, so edges will look very weird. Oh and of course a DM doesn't do perspective correction, so at low grid sizes you'll get distortions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow...NOW I understand it!  I've just been trying to go about it the hard way (sort of like long division by counting on your fingers)<br />
<br />
BTW - you're a major dude now, if you haven't noticed ;)<br />
But as Nic01 pointed out to me, you've been a major dude since Whacko AVS :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another method, although harder, is reverse engineering SSC equations.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
y=mx+c becomes x=(y-c)/m<br />
y=x^2 becomes x=sqrt(y)<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Now that I actually understand raytracing, I need to understand it :P<br />
<br />
I assume ox/oy/oz is the 'camera' and dx/dy/dz are the points on the texture.  But what do you mean by filling in equations for shapes and solving for k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th August 2002, 14:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Dx,dy,dz are the direction-coordinations of the ray. Initially these are set to (x,y,1). If you draw these for the entire grid of the DM, you get a rectangular pyramid of rays: this is the 'view'. Then, we rotate this view-pyramid to get the correct direction.<br />
<br />
So in the end we have the ray (ox+dx*k, oy+dy*k, oz+dz*k).<br />
Now suppose we want to raytrace the plane z=1. We replace 'z' with its parametric coordinate and solve for k:<br />
    oz+dz*k=1<br />
&lt;=&gt; dz*k=1-oz<br />
&lt;=&gt; k=(1-oz)/dz<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is the solution to the problem. We now know that the ray intersects the plane at:<br />
<br />
(ox+dx*k, oy+dy*k, oz+dz*k)<br />
<br />
Now you need to calculate the (x,y) coordinates based on those. Optionally you can do fog using alphablending.<br />
<br />
Of course for complicated arrangements (lots of planes) or higher order surfaces (cylinder, sphere, ...) the code gets a lot more complicated, but the idea stays the same.</div></div><hr />
