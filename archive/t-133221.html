      <p class="post-content"><strong>Acid Warp Avsstyle</strong><br />
      who remembers acid warp? that old plasma effect, not a visualsation, just a pointless app from about 7 years back.<br />
      well if you dont, here is my attempt at recreating it.<br />
      my version only goes through 5 modes. the real one used many more,<br />
      and also used blending method changes (eg, change beteen additive and xor blending on beat). I couldnt recreate some of the modes and others looked shitty anyway.<br />
      <br />
      so here it is.. lots and lots of experimenting with polar coords.<br />
      <br />
      this is probably a reject from my first pack (/one).. but that depends on response of this thread and how many others presets i get around to completing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">neat...i see a great preset coming out of this. make the colors brighter and have more contrast...in some of the modes it looks like only one or two colors...good job, though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice! I don't suppose you can make the sparkle pallets too, can you?<br />
      <br />
      My teached hated it after we got it running on all the computers in 2 labs because he didn't know how to exit it. :)<br />
      <br />
      BTW Acidwarp come from before 7 years ago. I remember running is in DOS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's nice. Don't really like the line caused by the movement with some of the circular ones.</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh. yeah.. that line between 1st and 4th quadrants appears on one of the modes.. probably something todo with miscalculating some sin or cos somewhere... oh well<br />
      the big blurry bit occurs in a particular mode when the random value is too low. I can easily fix that.<br />
      Those 'sparkle pallets', if we are talking about the same thing, would take a totally different dm coding, and probably, a totally different renderer.. so no..</p>

      <p class="post-content">sweet, i'm working on a preset that works on the same xoring principle in a couple of these modes...i think i'm going to have to see if i can get the original effect out of it :D</p>
