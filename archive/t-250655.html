      <p class="post-content"><strong>Looking for old visualization</strong><br />
      Hello<br />
      <br />
      I was looking for an old visualizaton which looked a bit like a caraudio vis. it had a size of a regular winamp 2 window (it fitted between main window and equalizer perfectly). it had two main options of display. the first one was a regular line equalizer and the other one had song title in the middle and bouncing lights from inside to outside (or the other way).<br />
      <br />
      big thanks for any hints regarding the name or location of that vis.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry</strong><br />
      sorry to break this to you man. but that sounds like the original winamp visulization plugin because one you did not specify if it was winamp v2.8 or 3.0 because any versions before 2.8 will not have avs or so i've learned about avs.<br />
      the avs package for winamp 2.8 are newpicks try there.<br />
      <br />
      also if youd like try this place they have all the old version of winamp. <a href="http://www.oldversion.com" target="_blank">www.oldversion.com</a></p>
