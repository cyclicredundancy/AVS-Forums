      <p class="post-content"><strong>What FPS do you get?</strong><br />
      Hi!<br />
      <br />
      OK, first off. I KNOW that AVS is all CPU based and very VERY resource hungry.<br />
      <br />
      But I've just come back to it after a number of years and a few upgrades and it is STILL slow!<br />
      <br />
      433MHz Celery --&gt; P4 1.6A@2.13GHz over 533MHz FSB w/ 256Mb PC2700 CAS2.5<br />
      <br />
      And I still can't run it at 640x480x32 in fullscreen about 5 FPS.<br />
      <br />
      Is that right? Is that still all our Ultra Quick Super Hyper CPUs can do? Or are people throwing more and more FX into the presets?<br />
      <br />
      Does this "experimental overlay mode" help? Is is meant to increase the speed?<br />
      <br />
      Are there any benchmarks about? This preset at these setting = this framerate on this CPU etc, etc, etc.<br />
      <br />
      Ta,<br />
      <br />
      D. :D :D :D</p>

      No AVS is not too slow for me, I get 40-60FPS is 320x480. I'm just curious to see a list of what people get at what res's on what hardware. Darned if I can find a current list.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Listen to Atero when he says that AVS is not a fullscreen plugin. Go download something hat is or maybe, just maybe you don't need the damned thing on fullscreen whenever you use it. Put up with it like everyone else or go code your own AVS plugin that's faster. You're not getting much better than a P4 and if it's still not satisfactory then tough.</p>

      <br />
      I'm very happy with AVS, ~50fps at 320x240 is nice enough, I'm not a res-freak like most people. I'm just looking for some empirical data to make comparisons to.<br />
      <br />
      I just wanted to know if my PC is running at the right speed and check that nothing is schitzing. Which you have answered.<br />

      <p class="post-content">640x480 is 4 times more pixels than 320x240. Add to that the fact that larger drawing area means more memory usage and that means less efficient caching, and it's still a huge slowdown.<br />
      <br />
      It's not really about CPU's now, but mostly about RAM.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero: I enjoy twiddling and making sure I'm getting all the performance I can get. 's kinda fun, sometimes.<br />
      <br />
      So the poor lil L1 cache and minimal increases in RAM tech over CPU cycles is more a contributing factor?<br />
      <br />
      Heh, this is why we used AVS as a synthetic overall system benchmark that didn't rely on a GPU, back in the day. Really shows what your PC can do as a whole without the GPU.<br />
      <br />
      I must run these new AVS presets on my celery in the other room and see what it gets up to now. See what the straight FPS ratio is.<br />
      <br />
      So NOBODY has compiled a list of Preset X at Settings Y = Z FPS for lots of different setups on the forum? I'm surprised.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Note however that there is a problem with AVS on modern computers that causes it to snap to certain FPS values (on my pc it snaps to integer divisions of 100, but some have reported 32/64 as well).<br />
      There was a thread recently about it, you should be able to locate it easily.<br />
      <br />
      To check if it was just the counter, or the real rendering, I hacked up a quick independent FPS counter, which results in the same values as AVS (it measures the amount of frames per second that AVS asks from an APE file). I guess it has something to do with the display drivers artificially slowing AVS down.<br />
      <br />
      Over here it only happens in Windowed mode, but you should be aware of this when comparing AVS performance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS only need the graphics card to display... all the other things are worked by the processor.<br />
      (I thought you said that you know AVS is CPU-based... o_O)<br />
      <br />
      Until we get to P7, I don't think 640x480 resolution can be a good choice...<br />
      ...One problem is, as the lower bound for processors rise, presets will also get heavier - So unless there's a huge jump in processor power, you'll be constrained to presets of the past. (Even then, there are some goddamned heavy presets there)<br />
      <br />
      For now constrain yourself to uberfast presets for such big resolutions...<br />
      (Well, not uberfast, but fast enough)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Vsync! Vsync! I still can't believe the fps "snapping" would have anything else to do than the refresh rate of your monitor and using "wait for retrace" :igor:<br />
      <br />
      But anyway, i get nice fps's with my Athlon XP +2100 and it doesn't snap the fps since i don't use "wait for retrace" , when i first got my new computer i did use "wait for retrace" and it snapped normally to 25,30,35,40 and so on, but didn't ever go over 60fps since my refresh rate was 60hz.<br />
      <br />
      Usually i can watch AVS at 320x240 with good framerates, even with the more complex presets, but for example i still get around 25-40 fps with Whacko VI in 400x300 :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tuggummi: Wait for retrace is definitely OFF ... besides, if that were on it still wouldn't mean that it would always snap to integer framecounts, and even if it did, my refreshrate is not 100Hz, so it doesn't make sense to snap at 25, 33, 50 and 99.9.<br />
      <br />
      I even did a simple test to verify that by some weird Voodoo Magic, wait for retrace was still kicking in despite it being off: make a preset with nothing but trans/invert. If retrace is off, you'll see a clear horizontal line in the flashing, if it is on then the flashing will be solid.</p>

I have an Atlon XP 3200+ (512KB L2 cache) 400Mhz FSB, 2x512 cas 2.0 DDR400 PC3200 ram (1GB total) on an Abit NF7 motherboard, and fullscreen avs performs a lot worse than any of my videogames at the highest resolution and quality settings. Now, i know that the video card has nothing to do with avs, that's whay i didn't even bother to list it. but you are saying that my CPU/ram are not good enough to display avs fullscreen?-- should i get a $700 Athlon 64 FX and like 10GB of ram to see some vis? -- I mean, this is ridiculous! and the worse thing is that i can't find winamp 1 anywhere (now, that had some good vis!)</p>

      <p class="post-content">it's not really how much ram you have<br />
      it's how fast your ram is (transfer rates matter)<br />
      <br />
      say we use 1600x1200 with 32bit color depth<br />
      and we have 20 effect lists(of which each has it's own frame buffer) and 8 buffers + 1 main frame buffer<br />
      makes (20+8+1)*1600*1200*32/8=222,720,000 bytes=212 MB RAM for this (quite excessive) setup. If you add windows, winamp and the like you'll not get more than 768 MB (my current RAM size ;) ), meaning that you will surely not need 10 GB RAM<br />
      <br />
      for a normal setup like 320x240 with the same preset you'll need<br />
      (20+8+1)*320*240*32/8=8,908,800 bytes=8,5 MB RAM which would fit in the RAM of an average 486 :)</p>
