<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
When I run AVS full screen the audio keeps jumping and then eventually it crashes and I have to close Winamp totally.  I tried using overlay mode but it has the same problem?<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">This is addressed some in the FAQ.  It sounds like your system resources are being completely used up.  Close out of any other programs, turn down the resolution, enable pixel doubling, and/or lower AVS's thread priority.  If it still doesn't work, your computer is probably too outdated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 11:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks Anubis,<br />
<br />
Its a strange one cos I'm running 2.4ghz p4 with 512mb ram and a Radeon 9000 graphics card.  I just changed the thread priority to same as winamp and that looks like its cured it.  It starts off smooth as you like but then the music starts to break up but the AVS is still very smooth.  It was working perfect until I installed a load of new presets the other day, maybe one has messed it up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 12:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No, they are probably just more system demanding presets.  None that I know of would cause winamp to slow down for no reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 12:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I think you are right, thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 13:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You aren't trying to run AVS at hardware-accelerated resolutions like 800x600 - 1024x768 are you?<br />
<br />
Don't. AVS is all software rendered (check the faq, first thread in main AVS forum).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 14:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I am running it at 800x600 but its very smooth and the audio prob seems to be fixed.  One thing I have noticed is that the beat detection is quite a way off (quite an important aspect of AVS I think)  When I look at the beat detection settings, its never more than 70% sure of the beat? Strange</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 21:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">This is because it is extremely difficult for the computer to detect the beat, are brains are far more advanced at doing this.  Try watching a spectrum analyzer and determining the beat from that.  Very difficult.:igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 21:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Fair enough Anubis what res do you run your AVS at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 21:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">even still, the computer can't detect subtleties of the beat all the time every time.  you're expecting WAY too much of any beat detection system to work all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 22:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah you both are totally right.  It doesn't help when I listen to Drum n Bass aswell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 22:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">800x600 pixel doubled. I have a PIII 1GHz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 23:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah 800x600 runs very smooth for me with a P4 and 2.4GHz shame the screensaver cuts in when using overlay mode,  I read somewhere that they recommend using this when full screen, what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 14:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I wouldn't recommend using overlay mode because it corrupts the colours a bit. I only use when I want AVS as my desktop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 14:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jaheckelsafar<br />
<br />
I think thats probably the best way, what do you mean by using AVS as your desktop? (probably a stupid question!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 14:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">If you go to settings/display under the overlay button you will see a set desktop to color checkbox. Enabling this will put avs on your desktop instead of a background picture.  This uses a lot of system resources though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 15:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow I never knew that, is there any way to get rid of the small window when using this setting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 17:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You have to minimize Winamp. I only do it when I'm running AVS on one screen and doing stuff on another. The desktop thing is the only way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 17:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">2 monitors, Jaheckelsafar?  I'm going to get another monitor. Right now I have my television hooked up, but it doesn't allow me to do everything(plus it has a max resolution of 800x600).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr Shibby</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 17:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">2 monitors is the way forward!  Having AVS on my desktop is giving me a headf*ck when I see things stationary and then all these crazy colours in the background, woh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 20:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I usually do it on a TV because it's bigger and not not as sharp as my monitor so things look softer. Beside AVS at anything above 800x600 would be too slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd January 2003, 20:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, but using other programs, 800x600 isn't enough, my videocard won't even shrink it, instead it scrolls with the mouse(this really doesn't work when I watch movies).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 01:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You can't get different resolution on different displays? That does make it kind of sucky.<br />
<br />
Ahh, ATI hardware is so nice. :)<br />
<br />
:confused: Ignore the thread about people have problems with ATI cards :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I have a Nvidia GeForce4 Ti4600.  It's nice but what I really want is a quadro 4 ($1500!!!).</div></div><hr />
