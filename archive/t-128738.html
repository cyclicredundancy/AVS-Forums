      This topic is ment for Dutch people only. It is nice for persons to be able to discuss AVS in their own language. I don't think people would really mind if I place it here, cause in the Nationalisation topic there really aint that much AVS-ers.<br />
      <br />
      Zo, welke Nederlanders hier doen er wat met AVS? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If there would have been many Dutch AVSers i`d have nothing against this thread but since ,as far as i know, there arent that many AVSers from the Netherlands this aint a good idea.Just think at all the finish guys that do AVS :) They dont have a thread...And its nice to talk in english so that everyone understands what you are talking.</p>

I already have the hardware and software, now I only need some time and some help to install it. My uncle will do most part of that, if I'm correct. I'll let you know as soon as I got a webby up and running.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just got a 19" rack and a shitload of other machines, though the hub seems to be broken, next thursday I'll get a new one. The system running on the 19" rack is LINUX DEBIAN 2.2 R6 Potatoe edition. Webserver: Apache 1.1. I'll add a mailserver as well though I want the webserver up and running to start with. The 19" rack is Pentium 166 with 64 MB RAM. Also I have to set up a proxy, and school aint that relaxed as well. I got my exams in less than two months. So it might take a while before I got everything done.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm not such an AVS-er. I like this Dutch tread, if it would be about AVS, and not domain names.<br />
      As we say:<br />
      "Jullie praten over koetjes en kalfjes."<br />
      "You're talking about little cows."<br />
      <br />
      ;-c,rattaplan: Maybe, just maybe, UCD meant that those Belgians are living on a wad: an unimportant piece of earth where you can do everything you'd like. (the Dutch people know what I mean, it's untranslatable:) "mosselen vissen tot ze op zijn", "de zee vervuilen", "de dieren wegjagen".<br />
      It's just an example. All those Belgian people should feel insulted by me, since I don't want to insult them.<br />
      Maybe UCD should explain what he meains with a 'wad'.</p>
