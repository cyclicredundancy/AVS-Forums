<div class="posttext">This topic is ment for Dutch people only. It is nice for persons to be able to discuss AVS in their own language. I don't think people would really mind if I place it here, cause in the Nationalisation topic there really aint that much AVS-ers.<br />
<br />
Zo, welke Nederlanders hier doen er wat met AVS? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If there would have been many Dutch AVSers i`d have nothing against this thread but since ,as far as i know, there arent that many AVSers from the Netherlands this aint a good idea.Just think at all the finish guys that do AVS :) They dont have a thread...And its nice to talk in english so that everyone understands what you are talking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Deamon : How about learning a little coding, getting a little webspace, and then using YaBB?<br />
<br />
That and visiting your neighbor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The problem is that as for as I know there are only a few Dutch-speaking AVSer. I think only me, UnConeD and Paranoya (long gone).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeh, I was wondering what &quot;wad&quot; means as well. And my excuses that I forgot all the Dutch speaking countries besides The Netherlands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 11:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">And yes, I'm already learning coding and webspace shouldn't be a problem. I'm getting my own server ^_^. I already have the hardware and software, now I only need some time and some help to install it. My uncle will do most part of that, if I'm correct. I'll let you know as soon as I got a webby up and running.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just got a 19&quot; rack and a shitload of other machines, though the hub seems to be broken, next thursday I'll get a new one. The system running on the 19&quot; rack is LINUX DEBIAN 2.2 R6 Potatoe edition. Webserver: Apache 1.1. I'll add a mailserver as well though I want the webserver up and running to start with. The 19&quot; rack is Pentium 166 with 64 MB RAM. Also I have to set up a proxy, and school aint that relaxed as well. I got my exams in less than two months. So it might take a while before I got everything done. <br />
<br />
Skupers, I'm sure you're not living in Arnhem?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No domain name yet, I think I'll start with a free .tk address as soon as everything works. I got all the hardware now, and software slowly comes as well. Though I have my exams in less than two months, so things will go slower and slower, but be patient, it'll come soon enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry for getting here so late, but I don't spend much time on the main AVS forum... <br />
<br />
I'm Dutch too and I have a website... If someone knows a nice host for forums, I'm willing to add a dutch AVS forum to my site.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
Wad (dutch): A part of the sea that becomes land on low-tide.<br />
 - Although I seriously doubt if UCD meant that because the dutch wads are totally at the north end of Holland, and Belgium is at the south...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not such an AVS-er. I like this Dutch tread, if it would be about AVS, and not domain names.<br />
As we say:<br />
&quot;Jullie praten over koetjes en kalfjes.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're talking about little cows.&quot;<br />
<br />
;-c,rattaplan: Maybe, just maybe, UCD meant that those Belgians are living on a wad: an unimportant piece of earth where you can do everything you'd like. (the Dutch people know what I mean, it's untranslatable:) &quot;mosselen vissen tot ze op zijn&quot;, &quot;de zee vervuilen&quot;, &quot;de dieren wegjagen&quot;.<br />
It's just an example. All those Belgian people should feel insulted by me, since I don't want to insult them.<br />
Maybe UCD should explain what he meains with a 'wad'.</div></div><hr />
