<div class="posttext">When you start making a preset, have a specific goal in mind for the end result; don't just randomly throw things together and hope it looks good.  If the way you're trying to make the effect doesn't work right, and you can't find the source of the problem, find a new way to do it and try that.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty convinced that the reason things are going wrong is the bump.  The same effect of this preset can be made much more easily and aesthetically.  I remember a long while back I made a b/w similar to this, but I can't remember how I did it.  (But it is doable.)  Just keep trying :)</div></div><hr />

Good place to find ROMs, just do a search in Yahoo for emulators.<br />
<br />
http://www.emurayden.com/<br />
<br />
That is a VERY good PSX emulator. As in it actually works 99.99% of the time. And since the CD-ROM in your PC has error correction and a much higher speed than the 2x of the PSX, even games which failed to work on PSX will work on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">y'know you could potentially get banned (at least temporarily) for saying shit like that on the forums, if i remember correctly :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Why would you get banned??<br />

<div class="posttext">The PSX emulator doesn't require a BIOS to run it, therefor it's not illegal, since it's not a fake playstation. The classic gaming site is legal since it's abandonware and if it wasn't legal there's no way in hell gamespy would host it.<br />
<br />
If it's not illegal then why get banned for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">emulators aren't illegal - it's the ROMs that are.  since you don't have to buy anything to play the game, it's a form of copyright/trademark/patent infringement [distributing, from an unauthorized source, product that is protected by copyright(s) and/or trademark(s) and/or patent(s) such that the owners of said protection(s) are monetarily damaged in some way -- note that this is not exactly what the law says, but it means the same thing (if I'm correct)</div></div><hr />
