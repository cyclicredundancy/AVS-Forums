<div class="posttext">Hello Friends,<br />
i have a big question at all winamp user ;) <br />
<br />
I searcht after the best winamp version.<br />
<br />
There are three groups:<br />
<br />
1. Winamp Version 2.xx<br />
<br />
2. Winamp Version 3.xx<br />
<br />
3. Winamp Version 5.xx<br />
<br />
<br />
I found the Winamp Version 3 very bad. But I don't tested enough this version.<br />
<br />
The Winamp Version 5 is very nice but very slow if you want to start the version.<br />
<br />
I find the Winamp version 2.xx the best ever. But there are so many versions. Like 2.91c, 2.76 etc.<br />
<br />
I look after the best Winamp version 2.xx ?<br />
<br />
At the winamp version 2 are many shut downs of the program.<br />
<br />
What is your favourit winamp version ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Your Ben</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i was never under the impression, that winamp 5 was any slower than winamp 2. the reason why i'm using winamp 5 myself is that i remember some security issues with some winamp 2 versions. i don't know if these apply to the last 2.x builds as well.<br />
<br />
however, if avs is the main-reason to stick to winamp - you can also use avs with foobar2000 (http://visbot.net/faq). however, presets on foobar2000 usually run (insignificantly) slower.<br />
<br />
you could've done a poll by the way. and the avs forum might not be the best place to ask, unless you're after the winamp with best avs performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you Yathosho,<br />
<br />
i don't know foobar2000.<br />
<br />
I look after the best performance for my old avs files.<br />
<br />
I don't need a libary. It is only to play some good songs.<br />
<br />
My big libary is in iTunes. Many mp3 files :D <br />
<br />
I sorted my music since ten years. All my mp3 files have a cover and the best mp3 tag. I use &quot;Mp3 Tag Editor&quot; from &quot;Florian Heidenreich&quot; how wrote this good program. :up: <br />
<br />
I want to use Winamp version 2 in the future. The start up is very fast. I like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Use WA5 and have a good read of this guide: http://nunzioweb.com/daz/like_the_wind/<br />
If you only install what you need then it should be equally as fast as WA2 but not as outdated ;)  (AKA don't install Modern skin support. etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you. I love winamp version 2 because it is an oldie player. I love old programs how was fantastic in the year 2000.<br />
I think winamp 5 is good too. But i love winamp 2 ;) <br />
<br />
But i will check your site and i check this with the winamp 5 version without any skin support, etc.<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Basically, winamp5 is winamp2, but with modern skin support and it's obviously much more up-to-date. But you could get a modern wa5 with the same speed as wa2 had if you know how to configure the installer</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I want to use the new winamp version 5. But i searched after a german version. I don't find any good one. Many versions had many spam in it.<br />
... and i want to use AVS Files... I need this if i want to hear my first mp3 files: &quot;Orange Blue - She's got that light&quot;<br />
<br />
Here this song with &quot;tom - pretty two.avs file&quot;<br />
<br />
Fantastic ...  :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only place you should be downloading the latest versions of winamp from our this site:<br />
<br />
http://www.winamp.com/media-player/<br />
<br />
http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/winamp5571_full_emusic-7plus_de-de.exe (Full version, comes with everything, so you'd probably want to deselect some things in the installer. See here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=280693))<br />
http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/winamp5571_lite_de-de.exe (Lite version, comes with less stuff so it's more like WA2.X out of the box)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2010, 15:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">also check this out: http://de.winamp.com/<br />
<br />
Lite also comes without AVS as far as I know. But you could copy your current ...\winamp\plugins\avs\ directory, and vis_avs.dll to the new version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Winelectronic</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th January 2010, 12:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I installed Winamp 5 Full Version but in the performance i use lite version with the avs plugin.<br />
It works. Thank you :D</div></div><hr />
