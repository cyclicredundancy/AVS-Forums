      Hello everybody !<br />
      <br />
      Don't know if someone had already try to make this, but here is my <a href="http://perso.club-internet.fr/pcharpen/avsreal/piR50_julia_I.avs" target="_blank">Julia's set preset</a>.<br />
      What do you think about ?<br />
      BTW, if you have a big configuration, you can (must) increase the value of 'imax' and/or the grid size in the DM.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't quite follow the avs scene do you? :)<br />
      I think Julia Fractal was first made 3-4 years ago in some of the whacko packs :D<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      Not to mention that this is about the 4th time someone "discovers" it for the "first time" :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">I do my best to follow what happens, but I have not enough time to take a look to every presets and packs that have been done for years ... :)<br />
      Nonetheless, I remember the Unconed's 'Julia Fractal', but, he was just using an approximation (it was - and it is - a good job anyway;)).<br />
      In my preset, I apply the real algorithm, using the precious loop() function : imax controls the depth of iterations, and the grid size, the quality of the draw (with the actual values, it runs only at 18 fps on my 'old' computer ... :()</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I knew it's a little bit too slow for small config, but with something more powerful, it must be better :)<br />
      <br />
      You can try <a href="http://perso.club-internet.fr/pcharpen/avsreal/piR50_julia_II.avs" target="_blank">this one</a> ...<br />
      It's based on the same principle but ... not exactly ;)</p>
