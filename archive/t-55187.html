<br />
<div class="posttext">T is just a variable.<br />
A variable is something that can store a number.<br />
(A value that can vary)<br />
<br />
So if you say:<br />
t=1<br />
Then 5+t will equal 6.<br />
You can use letters such as T to make your own variables.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know &quot;T&quot; is a variable and what a variable is..., but thanks for the help :)<br />
<br />
Ex. In superScopes T are not Initialized, So it means T have a Predefined value, aor an existing Value of the Compiler like D and R. <br />
if in the &quot;On beat&quot; I write&quot; ab= ab + 0.1;&quot; it dont Works. but if a Put T = T + 0.1, I can see a Movement in the Scope.<br />
<br />
I Know, means D = distance, I can configure that. and I understand what D is and how to work with it.<br />
<br />
What, is the T defaul value? with what value is &quot; T &quot; initialized  ? and PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE T DOES...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">t i just a predefined valible<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yep I gotta agree with Scarface here. :D T is a predefined variable, but it's nothging special. (I haven't checked this completely co son't blame me if I'm wrong) if you don't have a init value for a variable it just starts at 0. T is something special. I don't exactly know what is special about T except that it's counting even when you want it to stop eg.  in my morphig scopes. (&lt;= could be wrong code i've used, haven't tested it.) I just use another value for T it doesn't reall matter I usualy use f or fr. <br />
<br />
I can't be held liable for all the typ[ing errors I made here cause I'M DRUNK. :kill:</div></div><hr />
