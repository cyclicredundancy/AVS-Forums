<div class="posttext">Ok, i really dont wanna get flamed for this thread.. so if you feel like you are getting pissed off, please press the 'back' button now.<br />
<br />
I need to return the digits within a number alone..<br />
for example, from a random number number. 12345. i want to return the 3rd place from the right. (3). Or from the the number 54.123, it should return the number 1. <br />
<br />
The code needs to work for number of any reasonable leangth<br />
And needs to return a specifiable digit from the left or right (whichever you find more practical)<br />
<br />
any suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*Cough* Thats really hard to do man. You know this could be done in any programming language but not in AVS itself because there's simply no way of determining the length of a stringconverted var.<br />
<br />
Sorry, i don't have the slightest idea.<br />
<br />
But if you'd tell waht you need it for there's maybe another solution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You're lucky, I needed such thing when trying to do a point-frame relation (in my words, not yours) using only a few variables.<br />
n1=n/pow(10,a)%10 where a is the place from right minus one.<br />
Any faster solutions?<br />
<br />
(attached is the preset I worked on using this system. definitely not done, don't steal!)<br />
(progression is the old system, devised by skupers, 1.1 is the new version, still needs a lot of betterment)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thats similar to what i had when i got stuck.<br />
Ill check it for what i need when i get home.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill show you what it is when your done.. youll cream your pants.<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit][b]I just downloaded  winamp on this computer just to check out your idea.. Man, that is insane! i cant quite work out how it works, nor do i know how i can apply it to what i need..though.<br />
From what i can see, this will only work for multiples of 10. Which is about as far as i got aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">n1=0.12345/pow(10,-5)%10<br />
n1=0.12345/0.00001%10<br />
n1=12345%10<br />
n1=5<br />
<br />
It works for nonintegerA.<br />
Why would you need nonintegerB?<br />
<br />
Oh, and AVS is limited to 2^32 (4294967296) and 2^-32, and for every step right of the decimal point, the limit left of dec point lowers.<br />
<br />
What are you using this for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry, i keep editing my posts and deleting stuff. And then i come back and find that somone has just replied to the bit i deleted.<br />

You just gave me an idea nic, im gonna go hame and try it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nic, i got that far too, but as i said first, how would you determine the length of a random floating point number to count it from the right (or the left) not starting at the middle piont?<br />
<br />
You could only count down the decimals or up the real ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th May 2003, 08:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah.. i guess that is the problem..<br />
Here is the way i was doing it before<br />
<br />
1&gt; change float by multiplying be 10^number<br />
2&gt; kill remainder by subtracting number%1<br />
3&gt; subtract all the numbers to the left of the one you want, each multiplied by 10^(their respective position).<br />
<br />
here is another, easier way to do it that i have just discovered courtesy of nic.<br />
<br />
1&gt; change float so that the first remainder is the number you want. get that remainder using %, assign to 'rm'.<br />
2&gt; then use rm as base to find the first decimal: rm-rm%(10^leangth of number-1)<br />
<br />
as you can see, we are still quite stuck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">length=if(above(number/100,0),3,length);<br />
length=if(above(number/1000,0),4,length);<br />
length=if(above(number/10000,0),5,length);<br />
<br />
ugly and slow and finite, but should work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's what I use for displaying numbers:<br />
(val*pow(10,-digit)-.499999999999)%10<br />
<br />
for 'digit', use:<br />
number: 0 0 3 . 1 4 1 5... <br />
digits: 2 1 0  -1-2-3-4<br />
<br />
The .49.. is necessary because otherwise quantities ending in 0 will get rounded off incorrectly. E.g. try displaying &quot;10&quot;, which would come out as &quot;00&quot; if you'd use 0.5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i just realised how amazing that progressions thing of yours is nic!<br />
how would one go about increasing the number of points to hold/remember the previouse state for. <br />
<br />
(eg, at the moment it only last for eight frames, because there is only 8 points. But if you add more points, it stops working)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th May 2003, 16:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I know that.<br />
<br />
I can add more storage vars to increase either the length or the detail tenfold (hopefully), and even then it still won't use more vars than skupers' way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">poohbar, otherwise it could be very useful for things like tentacles and stuff..<br />
<br />
Here is what i would use that code for if you could make it better, and if you would let me steal it :D :D<br />
<br />
these dont react to beat or specdata at all, because their path needs to remain completely predicatble at all times, so they look kindof dull. Nice effect though.<br />
<br />
They work upon a static path, the further along i each point is, the lesser the point on that path is used. Each scope is slightly randomised so that they look like tails. And the path is completely different for different tadpoles.<br />
<br />
I havnt used these in a preset yet because i dont know how to make them reactive. :( any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Holy, that's goddamned nice.<br />
Steal no, borrow yes, give credit must.<br />
I'll see what I can do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">at the moment i cant use your code anyway.. i need the variables to hold for around 70-80 points (the maximum leanth of any of my scopes).<br />
<br />
btw, unconed's 'anemone' preset from Whacko V sets off in a similar direction, although hes used multiple scopes for each tentacle (cheater).</div></div><hr />
