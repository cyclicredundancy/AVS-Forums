		Funny ;). Reminds me of <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/6708783/" target="_blank">this</a>.<br />
<br />
Too bad you used maxblending, try making it solid (it's not that hard, just figure out when part A should be in front of part B based on camera angle).<br />
<br />
If I had more time, I'd remake it as a synched DM/SSC/Texer with the duck swimming happily on top of Texer-rippled water with onbeat bubbles and stuff ;).<br />
<br />
(fyi, 'Whiteboarders' = the people at #finnish-flash chat, creating odd drawings together over whiteboard)

I'd love the idea, but I don't have a clue of how to do that.

		Well it's easier if you use a camera model with a fixed object, rather than just rotating the object in front of the camera.<br />
<br />
For example, the beak has to be in front of the head when the camera is in front of the duck's face, and behind the head otherwise. You can do this easily in a camera model by just checking some coordinates.<br />
In your current code, you'd have to perform extra rotations and such.
