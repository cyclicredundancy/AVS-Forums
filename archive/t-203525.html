<div class="posttext">ART SIDE: you've got the normal linear perspective (a line) and get the middle point... and draw almost a triangluar shaped object, then do all the gradients and the zoom (like a rotoblitter ssc), and here's an example... <br />

There`s little example, just read comments<br />

thats not what he means, its just visual thingy... perspective<br />
<br />
there is no such thing as infinity, therefore parallel lines can not intresect there, and trust me... they dont :p<br />
what you mean, is that parallel lines *do* intersect, in non-euclidean geometry.</div></div><hr />

i do know that they dont intersect in euclidean geometry. that is why i wrote &quot;they seem to&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually you can express points and lines at infinity using homogenous coordinates. You add a scalar value to your existing coordinates, so (x,y,w) for 2D and (x,y,z,w) for 3D.<br />
<br />
To map homogenous coordinates to plain ones, use (x/w,y/w) for 2D and (x/w,y/w,z/w) for 3D. The reverse mapping is just (x,y,1) and (x,y,z,1). The points (x,y,z,w) and (2x,2y,2z,2w) represent the same point in 3D.<br />
<br />
By setting w to 0, you get a point at infinity.<br />
<br />
If you take two parallel lines in 2D:<br />
x-y=1<br />
x-y=2<br />
<br />
then you convert them to homogenic coords by replacing the constant term with a w term:<br />
x-y=w<br />
x-y=2*w<br />
which solves to:<br />
0=w (subtract second equation from first)<br />
x-y=0 (first equation updated)<br />
x=y<br />
<br />
so any point of form (a,a,0) is a solution, which represents the point at infinity at 45Â°, which is where these two parallel lines 'intersect'.<br />
<br />
Using homogenous coordinates in 3D allows you to express any 3D operation (translation, rotation, shearing, perspective projection, parallel projection, ...) as a 4D matrix. Without homogenous coords, you can't do translations and projections.<br />
<br />
In fact, it allows you to separate points (non-zero scalar) from vectors (zero scalar). If you add a vector to a point, you get a point again. Adding two points is not allowed, but you can add their difference (vector) to another point.</div></div><hr />

I think posting crap like he does just to become a &quot;Major Dude&quot; and raise your posts should be seen as violating forum laws.<br />
Seriously his sudden urges to post crap is unbelievable.Like 1/3 of the threads on the AVS section is MaTTFURY's crap.<br />

Kick him NOW b4 the forum gets wasted from his crap.:mad:</div></div><hr />

Topics/posts that are just complete nonsense will be deleted, or have the entire thread locked, at the moderators discretion.<br />
<br />
If a post is suspected to serve no other purpose than to increase the post count of the poster, then the moderators may, at their discretion, issue a PM to the member in question enquiring about the nature of the post. Posts/Threads that are blatantly post pumping will be removed/locked without recourse to the poster.<br />
<br />
To keep the page loading time and visual annoyance factor down to a minimum, ensure your graphical signatures do not exceed a maximum of 12,500 pixels or 15 kilobytes file size, whichever is reached first. Alternatively, three lines of text can be used as a signature. Do not pad out your text lines with blanks lines. A line of text is defined such that it does not wrap when viewed at a resolution of 640x480.<br />
<br />
What happens if I break the rules?<br />
At best your post will be edited by one of the moderators and you will be issued a warning. If the offence is more serious your post will be deleted. Posting &quot;why was my post edited/deleted?&quot; etc. will only make matters worse so please don't.<br />
<br />
Should you have already been issued warnings and continue to break the rules, you will be issued a temporary ban - your posting privileges will be disabled for seven days, but you will still be able to view the forums as a guest. <br />
<br />
Matt has done all of these things, and been warned several times.</div></div><hr />
