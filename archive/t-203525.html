      ART SIDE: you've got the normal linear perspective (a line) and get the middle point... and draw almost a triangluar shaped object, then do all the gradients and the zoom (like a rotoblitter ssc), and here's an example...<br />

      there is no such thing as infinity, therefore parallel lines can not intresect there, and trust me... they dont :p<br />
      what you mean, is that parallel lines *do* intersect, in non-euclidean geometry.

      <p class="post-content">Actually you can express points and lines at infinity using homogenous coordinates. You add a scalar value to your existing coordinates, so (x,y,w) for 2D and (x,y,z,w) for 3D.<br />
      <br />
      To map homogenous coordinates to plain ones, use (x/w,y/w) for 2D and (x/w,y/w,z/w) for 3D. The reverse mapping is just (x,y,1) and (x,y,z,1). The points (x,y,z,w) and (2x,2y,2z,2w) represent the same point in 3D.<br />
      <br />
      By setting w to 0, you get a point at infinity.<br />
      <br />
      If you take two parallel lines in 2D:<br />
      x-y=1<br />
      x-y=2<br />
      <br />
      then you convert them to homogenic coords by replacing the constant term with a w term:<br />
      x-y=w<br />
      x-y=2*w<br />
      which solves to:<br />
      0=w (subtract second equation from first)<br />
      x-y=0 (first equation updated)<br />
      x=y<br />
      <br />
      so any point of form (a,a,0) is a solution, which represents the point at infinity at 45°, which is where these two parallel lines 'intersect'.<br />
      <br />
      Using homogenous coordinates in 3D allows you to express any 3D operation (translation, rotation, shearing, perspective projection, parallel projection, ...) as a 4D matrix. Without homogenous coords, you can't do translations and projections.<br />
      <br />
      In fact, it allows you to separate points (non-zero scalar) from vectors (zero scalar). If you add a vector to a point, you get a point again. Adding two points is not allowed, but you can add their difference (vector) to another point.</p>

      <p class="post-content">no idea...<br />
      but i think he should get a last chance. i doubt that he will change his manner cause so many people already tried to bring him to sences.<br />
      But as everyone deserves a last chance so does matt. And when he also rejects this one, its more than justified to ban him permanently.<br />
      <br />
      just my opinion..</p>

      <p class="post-content">bad conscience?<br />
      but probably it was ok to throw in this idea. i mean someone finally had to teach him a lesson he can't ignore.<br />
      <br />
      Normally i'm a quite friendly guy, so there has to come a lot, before i really feel pissed off by someone. But matt finally managed it...</p>
