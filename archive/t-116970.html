      <p class="post-content">1: See those big, bright red letters saying to search the forum BEFORE you post? Obey them. This question has been asked many a time.<br />
      2: There's a really small filesize limit on posting in these forums, for obvious reasons; if everyone could post their music videos as you are suggesting, the servers would get rather fat.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok this isn't exactly a video, but here in Chile we do a cool thing called "Singing Festival" (well in Spanish this is "Festival de la Cancion")... anyway, a lot of artists perform in this festival, and there's a big screen that displays some crazy shit and animation and such, but last year they had a lot of AVS presets... I recognized that Tonic's preset "Help! I need more beats"... cool thing I think...</p>
