      Thanks to all those who helped with the fadeout effect on the DM. I changed the other DM to try and make it swirl and gloop, although that didn't happen, this did!</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, its kind of nice and smooth, the effect with the fade ins and outs is good but the colours look too noob (fushia, lime green, etc etc) and it gets a bit boring after about 15 seconds.</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually now that i look at it the colours are pretty good, i just glanced at it before sorry. I still stand by my it looks kind of boring comment, try making a morphing scope and use the colours on it. Very nice effect but you need a better scope to work with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>good point.</strong><br />
      yeah, I was aiming for a morphy-gloopy type DM, that came out! i'm still fiddling, and hopefully 'twill turn out correct. On the ssc note, I shall continue with the DM first, I think, then judge!<br />
      Yeah, I know about the whiting out etc, dunno if it's fixable.</p>

      <br />
      Sounds like me in my newbie years.<br />
      <br />
      If you have an objective to what you make, study about it a little and make it instead of merely fiddling around - you'll go far.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Whoa! I really like the smooth gentle fading effects and the scope is ever so subtle. Too bad it's pretty hard to see the music reactions, but who cares, this is sweet :) :up:<br />
      <br />
      ps. One complain do i have though, too white the screen sometimes is.</p>
