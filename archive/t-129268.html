			<strong>Is 2D avs still good to make?</strong><br />
		
		

		I dont know trig, so i'm forced to do 2D, but quite cool, avs.  Do you think that it is still acceptional to make 2Ds?:eek: :weird:

		yeah, zamuz made some pretty neat 2D in his visions pack, so has Tuggummi, UnConeD has, and others.<br />

make sure they are awesome, though

		2d can still kick ass ! the best way is to mix 2d presets with 3d(do 3d presets as far as your coding allows then add some of the tricks you use for 2d presets,maybe you`ll do smth sweet) in a pack.Do as much as you can, you`ll be surprised :)

		yes they are...tff3.0 is going to be mostly 2d, and a lot of the presets so far r4wk...2d meaning &quot;no moving cameras&quot;, i've got a lot of bumptrans and layering and psuedo-3d effects, but they're still 2d for the most part.

		2d presets are about niftaness, aesthetics (Degnic's latest pack), &quot;simpler&quot; yet still great environment (Tuggummi's &quot;Shoot The Core&quot;).<br />
<br />
You can't get all at once - And you shouldn't really try to, just try to make a great preset.<br />
<br />
P.S. : It's much easier to concentrate on color tricks on 2d presets.

		i like to play with effects and get loads of cool effects with 2d things then make DM's for them or add scopes, things like that. By all means do what you wish with avs, no ones forcing anyone to do anything :)

		Well to me it seems that all the 3D makers are the ones missing the new tricks. Everything i see in 3D is made only because &quot;3D is so Ã¼berCOOL!!!!&quot; :rolleyes: (exception, maybe UnConeD &amp; Zevensoft)

		Well even when i create some 3D SSC's, i mostly use various DM's and it won't look anymore like 3D.<br />
<br />
What i wanna say is that you can't do everything to a preset if you want it to look 3D like.

		I try to strike a balance in my packs between the number of 3D and 2D presets. However, the knowledge of 3D techniques is always a plus no matter what kind of preset is being worked on. The most important and beneficial technique to have knowledge of when using AVS, I think, is converting between cartesian and polor coordinants, something that I am still trying to master.

not necesarily, you can code without trig ( except the rotation matrix) but that would be way too lengthy ( and slow too )<br />
<br />
so in the end what do I conclude ?<br />
having an in depth knowledge of trig is important.<br />

		:cool: yah well i made the avatar in Xara 3d, thanx for asking.  I would really like to learn trig.  is there a book called trig for dummies or somthin.  or some one could just explain it to me in the simplist terms possible.:confused:

		Basically, what everyone has attempted to say amongst all the skwabbling was:<br />
<br />
2d presets can be so much better than 3d ones. The way i see it, 3d is just one of many many styles, all of which can kik arse if done well. but you still need to know what you are doing. never restrict yourself by saying that you dont know the math.<br />
<br />
Read atero's primer, if you swallow that, than your pretty much past the n00b stage. From there, its up to you imagination, this board is full of math tips, and you can always ask the friendly people if you get lost.

		3D is better than 2D because it allows that extra dimension.  Unfortunately, in order to do the same effect in 3D as you did in 2D, framerate is often used up much quicker, so the best effects aren't enjoyable in 3D(at least until AVS becomes hardware-assisted).

		The biggest plus I see for 2D is the DM, the DM can be used much more effectively (i.e. runs fast and doesn't create glitches) in 2D. For example.. flowing presets or texture warping.

		Yes, MagicX, but it's called the video card.  AVS only uses the video card to output to the screen.  Well, there goes that 650MHz of processing power on my GeForce4.  :hang:

		And all the lava etc.  presets are made 2D. I saw one lately made by fsk, though I can't really recall the name of it. And it looked really great, without any 3D used :P . And after all, the whole concept of AVS is 2D, only the big guys have started to create engines to convert 3D codelines in to the 2D code lines understood by AVS.

		it does not matter how you make it, the result is important. doing 3d presets does not mean, you're doing good presets.
