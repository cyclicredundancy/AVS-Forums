      <p class="post-content"><strong>Did they know?</strong><br />
      When AVS was made,I wonder if they even imagined what we would be doing with it in a year or two. What people do with it now is far beyond normal music vis's. We have complex SSC objects and raytracing DM's. What do you think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i have a feeling that they dont even know what we are doing with it. When justin was about for all the avs 2.7 stuff, he had never heard of ucd's apes. Which suggests that he never got a hold of the packs.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, avs was a system with, not unlimited possiblity, but unlimited potential. the makers would have had to have seen some type of advanced calculations used within the presets, or else it would not have been added in.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Remember that the preset idea had already been done before with vis's like Mocha or Whitecap. They were both codable similar to AVS.<br />
      <br />
      AVS added two important things: the ability to combine simple components together in any order, and an easy to use GUI.<br />
      <br />
      The question of intention is rarely valid. I think a certain Douglas Adams quote is quite fitting:<br />
      "First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII â€” and we thought it was a typewriter. Then we discovered graphics, and we thought it was a television. With the World Wide Web, we've realized it's a brochure."<br />
      <br />
      Oh by the way.. 'a year or two'? AVS is a lot older than that. AVS 0.1 alpha 12 says: Compiled on Aug 10 1999 at 18:25:50. That's the oldest one I can find.<br />
      Featuring a whopping 16 effects (render/trans). Funny thing is that a lot of things in 0.1 haven't changed (much). Like the n-color blenders for the render effects, or the built-in trans / movement presets (until 2.7 that is).</p>
