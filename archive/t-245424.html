			<strong>Looking for old preset</strong><br />
		
		

		While searching the avs forums, i saw this in a post from 2003 ...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to mention Scopeguru who releases one pack I know of, it has some of the best 3D synchronized scopes EVER, I'm talking about things like a couple hundred scopes to make a piano that has keys that move &quot;correctly&quot; with the getspec signal.&quot;<br />
<br />
This piano preset sounds interesting, i searched for anything about &quot;Scopeguru&quot; on Winamp.com, but didn't find anything. This one message is all the info i have, i don't know the preset name or the pack name. By any chance, would someone know where i can find this preset, or perhaps someone has it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, i'd really like to see this preset. The full pack would be an extra bonus. :-)

Thanks, if you don't mind. I only knew to search with Google, search winamp.com and the avs forums. And i came up with nothing but that one message. Meanwhile, i'll try avsociety and visbot.<br />
<br />
/edit: argh .... i haven't found a link for AVSociety. But i did find Visbot, but no hits on scopeguru.

		I vaguelly remember someone like that. At least the piano preset. Doubt he was in the AVSociety (unless it's that Leo guy's nick... not sure). Would check my old backup cd's, but they're halfway across the country.

		Damn that sounds familiar, but iirc it was severely overrated lots of badly overdrawing wireframe superscopes made the trivial way (lots of data entry as opposed to clever procedural generation)<br />
<br />
If you are looking for some triumph of code, you wont find it in that pack. Sorry :P<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb most super r33t++ 3d superscopes come from:<br />
<br />
1.) Me<br />
2.) UnConeD<br />
3.) EL-VIS<br />
4.) PAK-9<br />
5.) Tuggummi<br />
<br />
Other people make leet superscopes too, but between the 5 of us are probably all of the most well known and most technically impressive ones.

Thanks. I had already found this site while looking for the piano preset. Unfortunately, it wasn't there.

		my theory is that scopeguru is one of those avsers that just disappeared and never returned like shreyas_potnis did.<br />
hmm strange tho anyone who made a preset like that would have thousands of downloads. maybe just maybe some of the original avsers might have the preset but then again a preset from 2000-2002 are very rare to find if the person who made them is no longer around. well this is the last post i put into this thread. sorry Dude can't help you there.
