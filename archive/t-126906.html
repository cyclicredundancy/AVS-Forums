      <p class="post-content">Cats are spooky. Some say they are constantly aware of the 'astral' and can travel to other dimensions and even see dead people. Nothing against cat lovers... I just never got along too well with cats.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, you saying I'm bitching about your avatar?? I actually like the profile of your cat. Don't like 50 threads being made by sgt rock and the like in GD, though I normally help them anyways. And michael, I don't like your avatar. Very cheap looking. At least through a somewhat decent effect on it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Classic? Oh please... Anubis, well i thought your old avatar was a classic too, im still not used to your new avatar :p<br />
      <br />
      But you just have to live with it. Besides i think no one is going to make an avatar tribute preset out of this one! :blah: Why do people do it anyway? They don't make really enjoyable presets to anyone but the original avatar holder... :weird:<br />
      <br />
      *edit*<br />
      Besides i think you're all just shocked to see my real face and don't want to look at it. :D</p>
