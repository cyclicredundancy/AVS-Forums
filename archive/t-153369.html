      Has anyone checked it out yet? The beta release is a little buggy - but a few features that you guys might find interesting...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Documentation coming soon when I have learnt the best way of explaining things for it. Eventually I will get there but at this stage I have not been too involoved in the devolpment (as trying to do the business side of things like R4 and other vis projects we are working on).<br />
      <br />
      Too fast hehe<br />
      <br />
      Give me a month or 2 and it will be more complex and then you will notice the slowdown. :)</p>

      Are you implying that you cant render poly's in AVS? It's been done by... ooh, say almost <b>every</b> AVS artist!<br />
      <br />
      mmmmmm.... polygons :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Haha! If you can show me 1 preset that can render even 1/10 as many polygons as that then I wont laugh at the thought of rendering polygons in AVS. Oh and if it's that easy then I don't think it'd be too much to ask for at least gouraud shading with phong highlights would it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yumm, gouraud shading + phong shading!<br />
      <br />
      How about some ape's for this (just a joke).<br />
      <br />
      But we could need some kind of Antialiasing-Ape to make ssc's look better. We use bluring for this purpose, but intelligent antialiasing would be much more preferrable.</p>

      <p class="post-content">antialiasing ape ? are you crazy ? not all of us have 3ghz CPUs and 512ddr of RAM...I`ll prolly have 4-5fps WITH pixel doubling and AA 2x...And that just sucks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nonono, goddamit no! You got me wrong dude.<br />
      <br />
      It shouldnt simulate any 3D thing but instead do similar things as texer does:<br />
      <br />
      Look for dots. See which dots are next to each other and form a line.<br />
      Smooth the dots of this line along its direction.<br />
      <br />
      Normal blur would do this too but not quite perfect. This would be some sort of "intelligent blur".<br />
      <br />
      Edit: just think of the font antialiasing that is commonly used by microsoft programs / os</p>

      <p class="post-content">An anti-aliased superscope is very possible... I have some fast anti-aliased linedrawing code sitting around (with correct ends too, not too horizontal/vertical chops like AVS).<br />
      <br />
      Though it uses floating point, so I'd have to convert it to fixed point for usage with AVS (otherwise I can't use MMX for the blend modes).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks a lot better than AVS. &amp; the FPS are through the roof. Although it did use all of my available CPU. If the interface &amp; code is easy enough to use, this is going to give AVS a run for its money.</p>

      </blockquote>This would be awesome cool! Superscopes do certainly look ugly in low resolutions as long as no blur is applied.
