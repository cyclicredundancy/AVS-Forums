      <p class="post-content">Your preset isn't much, but that's ok for a 'beginner'. Welcome to the wonderful world of AVS!<br />
      A good idea is not to spend much creating 'nice' presets in the beginning... just spend time combining all sorts of effects and see what the result looks like. Try to understand how to achieve a certain effect. Once you've gotten some AVS knowledge, you'll be able to create better presets...<br />
      <br />
      If you're comfortable with the built-in effects, it's time to learn how to program your own Superscope, Movement or Dynamic Movement settings. This requires a good knowledge of basic highschool math like trigonometry or analytical geometry, but there are a few guides around that can point you in the right direction (search for a thread titled 'AVS Tutorials', it's a collection of links). Just don't try to learn it all in one day :).</p>
