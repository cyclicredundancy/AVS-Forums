      i must say, the presets suck. but i'm excited about you - you're a decent coder, and your presets (while being poorly put together) are original. in fact, you're probably one of the best avsers i've seen come up in recent months. keep up the good work man...cheers</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heh, Kova is "Hard" in Finnish, so i tried hard to find any clue wheter or not you indeed are from finland, didn't find any :hang:<br />
      <br />
      The coding was apparently good since i didn't understand a bit of it :p But i agree with atero that the presets themselves didn't look that good.<br />

      Good for a first pack still :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have to agree with atero, these are ugly. But the coding seems good.<br />
      <br />
      A word of advice: don't use el-vis' 3D translation. It isn't very optimized. There appears to be useless division in the translation part.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I see you as somewhat of a "different" AVS artist (even if some presets were kinda crap) but the good ones were very original and artistic. :cool: :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Place was a pretty good scope. But otherwise, lots of noob presets. Keep working with your code &amp; develop your own thing.</p>
