<br />

<div class="posttext">What we have here is a 4.75 pack. :)<br />
<br />
I absolutely love Gyro (Montana's remix as well) and Proxy (Yathosho's remix too). Some of the others are very good as well. It feels just a touch too repetitive, but it's a great pack nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yay my remix made it in the pack :D<br />
Woo, the rest of the pack is really cool too, kudos Mr Nudge!<br />
My favorite is proxy.<br />
[Although, I did prefer the previous version of gyro.]</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sweet pack. Keep on going like this and you will become on of the most famous avs creators, if you're not already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">now that i'm going to bite your butt for Nudge.<br />
saying something like that can and will hinder your brilliant work. i've never seen so many beautiful presets before in my life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">on second look i regret sending the prototype remix, maybe looks a bit 2002.. the other one hopefully makes it up. good pack, you put a lot of effort in it, no? and look it's even DD! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th October 2006, 02:46</div></div>

<div class="posttext">I was actualy impressed my Liquid and Firewall remix made the cut. Anyway i look foward to doing remixing your next pack. Chow</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">This pack is pretty damned awesome. :)<br />
<br />
Proxy is especially cool. The yathosho remix is nice too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd November 2006, 00:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">cheers J. a lot of people seem to like proxy.. and apparently it's easy to remix. i made a new version for the forums compilaton so it should be interesting what people think of that. by the way, what did you think of how wireframe finally turned out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd November 2006, 13:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">its an interesting preset, but the mouse control doesn't really add much for me. all the points start to converge once the mouse is on the screen which is a bit annoying :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd November 2006, 09:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I thought this pack was very well done overall, I forgot to mention it anywhere. <br />
<br />
Its generally a higher standard of preset than I am used to from you, good colours, structure, and some quality remixes. I will try to put a decent review on devart, but for the mean time.. good job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd November 2006, 12:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks so much you guys! i guess i'm just trying to get some in depth feedback to know where i stand. it's good to hear that so far people have enjoyed it, and now i've got an idea of what i need to work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">The Earthquaker</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th November 2006, 12:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Very good pack! And remixes are outstanding.<br />
I cannot say more about smooth 2d visuals...<br />
...and so I won't.</div></div><hr />
