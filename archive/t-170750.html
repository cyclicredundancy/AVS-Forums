      <p class="post-content">If you are a new AVSer (and really, even if you're not) these are pretty good presets. The important thing is that for just starting out, these are pretty origional. And you seem to have a good grasp on the math so far, so all I can say is keep creating more new and original effects.<br />

      That is used to rotate coordinates in 3D space. It involves trigonometry, which I don't think I should try to explain because I'm in no way qualified (and I'm not sure I understand it 100% myself). But you have used it the right way here, so I wouldn't worry so much about HOW it works, just know that is does.

      That gives a full explanation of how to derive those equations and how they work.</p>
