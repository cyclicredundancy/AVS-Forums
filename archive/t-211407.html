		I imagine that the 'virtuosos' must get tired of looking at the same old 2D crap.Sorry about that. I am plodding along, learning slowly but I will get there some day.:)

		Oh, and this time I believe I steered away from any APEs. If there are any, please point them out so I can remove them and work around them? Thanks.

		not bad, you're slowly getting better! You should try to avoid those hectic movements. Mostly you can achieve that by scaling down the movement-variables.<br />
From all presets i like warpo tunnnel best, its quite stylish.<br />
Another general advice: make sure, to know the <i>predefined</i> avs-variables (x/y, r/d,...) and when/where to use them. 't' for example is an <i>individual</i> variable, that can be specified by the user. For exapmle in 'warpo tunnel' you used t=t*d in the pixel-box of the dyn-movement, but actually that doesn't do anything at all.

		ah, ok. I was really just experimenting to see what would and wouldn't work. I never did understand the t variable very well. Thank you.

		you know pak's programming guide, right? Here you can find all avs-variables together with an explanation. You will also find them in the expression help of the avs editor, but most of the time  it gives only scanty explanations.<br />
So, these vars can't be used for anything different.<br />
<br />
All other varibles you might come up to in any code are user-defined. However, some of these are quite 'predefined' cause they're used for the same purpose by most AVSers. So you often find variables which are user-specified, but most common have the same meaning. That 't' is usually used as a basic variable to change values.

		Yes sir, I refer to Pak's guide quite a bit. I understand all the predefined variables (for the most part), I think I just assumed that 't' was a 'reserved' variable because winamp uses it in the default scopes. Now I see that it is assigned a value also. :D Also, it is usually set in the frame box, and I am not really quite good enough yet to implement code in there so I never look at it (I guess I'll start now!) Thanks for your help.

		first of all i should tell you that all variables have a value assigned (that's what vars are for ;)). However, those predefined variables just are 'purposive'. Their use is restricted (eg. you can use them only in certain codeboxes) AND: (most important) if you're working with them it has a direct influence on the preset! For example in a superscope you can assign t=whateveryouwant and it won't have any consequence as long as 't' isn't used with x,y,linesize,red,green,blue... etc. When you use eg. x=x+sin(t) it is visible at once when you make changes to 't'.

		Yes, I understand that. Now, when I use trans/movement to affect a superscope, does it use the same variables? For instance if I defined 't' in the scope, would the trans/move recognize this? What, for that matter, about dynamic move, distance mod, shift, etc.? <br />
And something I don't understand about assingment, why would someone assign 't' (or whatever) a value of '0'? I mean, what's wrong with just saying x*0 as opposed to going to the trouble of defining 't' as '0'and then saying x*t? I realize this is a basic fundamental thing to the maths involved, and I hate to make you try and explain basic concepts, but can you maybe give me an example of a situation in which you would rather use a variable than the number? I suppose it's because of the way certain operations affect(or are affected) by numbers in the binary? Or am I not making any sense at all and should reread my high school algebra book? Sorry, all of this could have been moved to troubleshooting.

		About your first request: No it's not possible. If you specify a variable like 't' in a superscope it's value is only accessable in that particular effect. BUT: if you want to receive it's value within another effect (it's mostly used to synchronize different effects like a couple of ssc's or so) you can use the global variables or registers. <br />
<br />
Now about your '0' problem: i didn't exactly get your problem, but i'm trying to understand. If you meant doing something like the following, it'd surely be possible, but actually rather unhandy (not to say total crap):<pre><code>frame:<br />
t=0<br />
<br />
point:<br />
x=x*t</code></pre>You could simply write x=0 to lead to the same result. Or write nothing at all, cause the initial value of all variables is '0' if not specified otherwise. But we usually use 'variables' to get 'variable values', that's kind of obvious, isn't it? So if you for example want to receive 0 on beat and 1.36127846 otherwise you would use variables (and a tiny amount of code).<br />
<br />
However i'd suggest that you take time to work through the 'Programming Guide' once again. Also it could be helpful if  you worked with these other <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">helpfiles.</a>

		Thank you so much, once again ^..^.  you did understand my problem and you explained it perfectly. :)<br />
<br />
Hey, remember the 'unknown' presets in my system files? They were all done by someone called 'PWS', and they seemed to be pretty old skool. (I believe I am just about as good in less than a month of trying).<br />
<br />
It's funny, knowing what I know now about what makes a good preset, I am going to have to go through all my dl-ed presets again and toss a bunch more, because now I know what it took to make them, and some don't seem that great anymore.

		It's right, some of the magic fades away while you get 'enlightened' more and more. :D<br />
But for sure, you'll always find new fine eye-candy / kick-ass presets...<br />
cause you can't know all AVS authors, so from time to time you'll find new artists and new styles. (see: i didn't even knew pws before) ;)

There is nothing wrong with APEs in general. Color Map, Triangle, Texer 2, Convolution, etc they are all great APEs with great uses.<br />
<br />
You should simply avoid the 3D apes, because they are very limited in customizability. We've seen them before, they're boring.
