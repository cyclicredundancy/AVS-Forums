<div class="posttext">If anyone could tell me.... Is it possible to use AVS in a vehicle. If it is equipped with a laptop computer and an lcd screen. Is there any possible way it can be hooked up  so that the AVS could work through my 5.6 in. car screen?? I would just like to know if there is any way because I wouldn't have the slightest clue as to where I would have to start. Thank You</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure you could use a graphics card that has S-Video ports in it.  I think Matrox has a card out that can do this cheaply.. 300-400 dollars (US).<br />
<br />
There are other applications out there.. it's just a matter of searching for them on altavista, lycos, yahoo, or google (to name a few).<br />
<br />
I'm sure you could hook a computer running AVS up to a laser, and do a laser show of some kind.  Ofcourse it would only be in two colors.. :)<br />
<br />
Ask around.. there may be other people in the community who have tried diffrent applications.  I for one wouldn't mind working with an LCD or Digital projector..  Imagine how that would look??</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to hook up any type of screen, provided you could physically connect it (possibly using an adapter) and provided windoze was capable of utilising it. Aside from some very old non-standard monitors that shouldn't be a problem. RF output would be useful to hook up a television set (though most newer TVs also accept S-video and composite). Most laptops come with an s-video output nowadays.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to use it in a vehicle? I hope not while you were driving?<br />
<br />
Nostej: yes, a projector looks lovely. try expanding the image to fill a whole wall :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you can have more then two colors, have you knwo that screen that your looking on right now is just very fast lasers giving you all of the color and light to see to make more and more posts :D:D:D:D</div></div><hr />

you haven't seen these?? they are quite popular with some cultural groups (not to stereotype) and it is common for them to play pornography while cruisin around town.  obviously they don't really watch what's on (hopefully) but for passengers, and more importanly onlookers in other cars, the video screens are a real status symbol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I guess every forum has a wise guy.. you must be him scarface..<br />
<br />
There are laser spliters out there that can do more than one color.. but I don't know much about lasers..<br />
<br />
And your monitor only shoots a single 'color' wave length.. I think it's the mesh under the glass that has clusters of 3 chemicals/metals that offer RGB(red green blue) light.  Depending on what instruction are given to the monitor, it fires photons at the needed portion of the cluster..<br />
<br />
It's not REALLY a laser..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ah, once again a chance for me to discharge the huge amounts of info I have collected in my 14 short years of life... :D<br />
Lasers:<br />
L.A.S.E.R. - light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation<br />
Lasers basically work by using something such as a quartz crystal, powered by high voltage electricity to give off a *bright* flash of light. This in turn stimulates the atoms in a gas / liquid in a cylinder. The cylinder has a 100% reflective mirror at one end and a 95% or so reflective mirror at the other.<br />
The atoms are excited to a higher energy state and give off more photons. These in turn excite other atoms and the ligh inside the tube rapidly increases until it is strong enough to come out of the partially silvered end.<br />
I assume that the colour depends on the substance used in the cylinder. Presumably red is the easiest substance to get hold of. I personally have seen red, yellow, blue and green lasers. Therefore you should be able to get any colour you want.<br />
<br />
it would be SO DAMN cool if you could get a smoke screen generator and RGB lasers. To create like, a half mile high AVS visualisation in the sky at night.<br />
*gasp* The concerts of the future are gonna be so great! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">maybe you can hook up one of those projectors to the top of your car with one of those remote control lighting rigs and fix a control stick and a lap top to your dash and you could shine it anywhere. (I know this is far fetched) but think about it, get a great stereo system for the lap top(or I'm sure theres a way to hook to the cars speakers) shine that on someones wall during a party and you've got yourself a mobile street club</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you have an LCD in your car, there's no reason you can't run AVS on it.<br />
<br />
 All you need to do is hook up your laptop to whatever the input is for your LCD. You can run it through a vcr or dvd player and it will work just fine, this is probably the easiest way to do this because you just unplug it when you're done and there's no leftover wires.<br />
<br />
 One of my buddies has actually installed a s-video input plug in his glovebox to make hooking up his laptop easier. <br />
<br />
 If you want to know how to do these things, I'd suggest a car-audio forum... They're all over this stuff..</div></div><hr />
