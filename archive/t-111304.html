      <p class="post-content">Sorry, but too lazy to download the file and tell you what I thought :hang:<br />
      This is one of those common nettequette things: Don't ask people to give their opinion of your work and act like they should put more work into getting the actual thing that you do. It takes about the same amount of time to add the .zip to the end of the file as it does to zip the file in the first place. If you are too lazy to zip the file, what makes you think we're going to put in the work to take off the .zip? Not everyone has their comp configured so that it's easy to do. My point being you're making an ass of yourself when you attach the .zip ending instead of making it a zip. :mad:<br />
      Also, there's no need to make a poll of this. That's just common sense: Look around the forum, see how many polls there are. I'd guess 6 at most.</p>

      Wow, all you needed to do was change the file name by taking off the last few letters, sorry if thats a little to hard for you. you don't need to be an ass about it. all i was doing was sharing content, kinda half the point of this forum.:hang:<br />
      I didn't relize there we're assholes on this forum, but i guess there's always the few in all of them</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's just that it's annoying to have to rename files to look at them. Infact, it takes less work to zip them than to rename them (if your computer is setup properly). :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, to the fire. Movement is good, especially for something like fire. Fire is chaotic, and constantly changing. Yours was static. The flames looked kinda nice, but they didn't move. It's decent for a noob effort though. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">What the hell is your problem? All YOU had to do was right-click and hit 'Compress,' if you have your computer set up properly as Jaheckelsafar said. Sorry if that's to hard for you. If you want someone to look at your preset, then don't make them do the work that you should've done. It's like making a rough draft of a paper and asking for someone's opinion of it - after they spell check it for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Also it is easier to download and select "Open file from location..." than to save it to a folder, Open the folder, rename the file, move it to your avs folder when all you could do is to extract it straight to your avs folder after you have downloaded it and if your last extract path was avs then hell it's even easier Just click ok ok ok (like installing windows9x :D)! (with winzip)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't like renaming files either (note that this is very hard to do, if your Windows is setup to hide file extensions). If you want as many opinions as possible, make sure the least effort is required, it's as simple as that.<br />
      <br />
      As far as your preset is concerned, here are a few points:<br />
      <br />
      - The second effect list has output mode 'replace' which overwrites the output from the first effect list, effectively making it useless.<br />
      <br />
      - The code contains useless statements: x=cos(r/24)*.6;sin(r)*0.3;. The part after the first semicolon is a statement without assignment. This means the value sin(r)*0.3 isn't stored or used anywhere.<br />
      <br />
      - Your scopes should fill the entire window. You can achieve this by moving and scaling your x and y coordinates. To move a coordinate, add a constant to it (x=x+.5), to scale a coordinate multiply by a constant (x=x*1.2)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh and please use regular, black text. Easier on the eyes :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Firstly on the matter of renaming file extensions, if you have your windows set up to not hide extensions then it IS faster to rename it than to unzip it since when the save box comes up from IE you can just rename it there - click-drag-delete, not hard. However, please use zip in future, its just what everyone is used to and I have to say that its almost built in to my brain to extract files with .zip extensions after I've downloaded them.<br />
      <br />
      Secondly, how do you define 'awesome fire effect'. No offense but your effect is too simple, too static and littered with redundant components. Fire needs to be complex and dynamic - because that is how it is in real life. Also (this probably applies to me only) your not going to impress people with really inefficient methods and bad code.<br />
      <br />
      Thirdly you just multiply x and y by your scale factor at the end of everything in your scope. Make sure you understand the code and what it does more thoroughly otherwise you'll end up getting confused whenever someone gives you advice.</p>
