			<strong>TV Tuner APE</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm trying to write an APE plugin that utilizes my analog TV Tuner card.  I have some C++ experience, but I don't have much experience programming in Win32 or in MFC.  I found a nice <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dx8_c/directx_cpp/htm/usingthevideocontrolinc.asp" target="_blank">tutorial</a>  on MSDN explaining how to insert a TV tuner control, however I have no idea how to turn this into an APE. Any coders out there feel like giving me some pointers or even collaborating with me on this one?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Dys

		What the FUCK'reyoutalkinabout?  Trying to use realtime TV input in AVS, or capturing TV video for AVS?  The former is pointless, useless, and as far as I can tell virtually impossible.  The latter is quite easy with a VCR and...some other stuff.  Ask other compufreaks about it, they'll tell you.  You just need to make an AVI and use the Render / AVI function in AVS.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you mean something else, elaborate and simplify.

		Um, I meant the former.  What's so wrong about using a live TV feed?  It's constantly changing visuals... And from a look at the MSDN code, it doesn't seem impossible at all...

		You need to access the pixel data in 32-bit RGB0 format from the TV feed and dump it into the AVS framebuffer.<br />
<br />
I doubt the video control is useful because you need low-level access to the data. A control is typically something that just requires you to call one method or function and shields from all the stuff that's actually useful.

		Yes, but you forget that no one is going to use it.  Everyone using it would have to hook up their TV to their computer, and who in God's name is going to move their TV over by their computer just so they can watch Spongebob Squarepants have a seisure?<br />
<br />
And another thing - the feed would have absolutely no response to the music, so you'd be better off using an arbitrary fixed feed anyway.  There's absolutely no point to it.

		Hmm... I dunno about a TV feed, but a webcam feed might be cool. Have someone walking around with a camcorder, streaming dancers into AVS.

		Holy freaking crap man, you are completely not understanding at all.  You see today, we have these things called TV Tuner cards you might find out something about them <a href="http://www.hauppage.com" target="_blank">here</a>.  And the point is, I don't care if anyone will use it, I want to use it.  That's why I'm programming it.  I'm just looking for some help from someone who has more Win32 C++ experience than I do.

		I must say I love this idea. Setting up a vid-recorder or camcorder to my pc and use the picture in AVS-presets would be extremely cool if using AVS for projections at partys, raves, etc....

MrDys : Chill man. Open forum. Just adding my $0.02. I never got that deep into coding.

		Lion King found the aforementioned APE. Link's available from here. Looks like it does a TV feed too.<br />
