<div class="posttext">Here's an odd request:<br />
<br />
Way back in Winamp 2.xx, there was a visualization included as someone's picks that (I think) was called Trippy Purples, or something along those lines (it did have Purple in the name)... does anyone have any idea how I can find this visualization again, apart from installing all of the different versions on Winamp?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if it was AVS, then you should post a picture, or atleast give a describtion, but if it is an stand-alone vis, then you should be able to find it in the plugins section, and search for it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">are you looking for an AVS preset or some other visualization? tried searching this website for trip (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/browse.php?search=yes&amp;filter=C&amp;query=trip)  and purple (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/browse.php?search=yes&amp;filter=C&amp;query=purple)? maybe those screenshots are a help. <br />

<div class="posttext">It was an old AVS preset that came bundled with Winamp when you installed it (like in Justin's picks), and since I don't have it on any of my computers, I can't post a picture. I'll try and describe it, but I doubt that it would help... it was a simple visualization that had a spinning red line as the analyzer, and the background color was a purple that faded to red, basically.<br />
<br />
Any chance that anyone hasn't uninstalled Winamp 2 and could look for it on their computer? This is an old AVS preset from years ago (I know I had it like 5 or 6 years ago, if that helps at all).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick replies... it wasn't in the zip file, but I'm going to look at winampheaven and install some of the older versions and see if I can find it... if not, I guess I'll install some more :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I found it!<br />
<br />
It was included in Winamp 2.61 Full, when we first got AVS 2.0 . Thanks for everyones help.<br />
<br />
BTW, it is called mighty tastey purples, in the Justin folder. It seems to run a lot faster now, though...</div></div><hr />
