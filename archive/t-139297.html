      <p class="post-content"><strong>two bass spins in diferrent time?</strong><br />
      I made two bass spins.<br />
      The first is green on the left side and red on the right side.<br />
      The second is yellow on the left side and blue on the right side.<br />
      <br />
      it looks great with some fyrewurx, two on beat clears with red and blue colour. There is a roto blitter and a blur, too.<br />
      <br />
      The problem is, that every time you start it, the two bass spins start the same time. so you see only green and yellow.<br />
      <br />
      So the question is how to start with one second or something like this between the two spins?<br />
      <br />
      If you want to test it, its the zip-file.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't think there's any way you can do that short of coding the bass spin into a superscope.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nope, you can't do it without making those bass spins with a superscope(s). That's why we love superscopes, gives us much more control and is so flexible! :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey you can!<br />
      <br />
      There is a video delay APE, search for it within the APE list thread. The APE saves frames and restores them back later.<br />
      <br />
      A more simple method would be to set the bassspin on top to line rendering so you can see them both.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Got it.</strong><br />
      It takes enough time, when I put the first spin at the beginning of the list and second at the end.<br />
      <br />
      When I start it now the bass spins are not again over each other<br />

      <p class="post-content">This is practically impossible because everything within a frame gets the same vis data. As long as you don't add the second bassspin at runtime, they always should be equal.<br />
      <br />
      Could you post the preset here as it is?</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol, why do you need bass spins when you have ssc's?just a little effort in learning could help you a lot.I repeat ssc's are way more customisable and flexible than bass spins.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, it's in the Technically Incorrect pack, and it's not a correct bass spin. (no, really)</p>
