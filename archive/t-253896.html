			<strong>Suggestion</strong><br />
		
		

		your triangle work is impessive earth but try combining your colission algo to the triangle and apply a moving 3d model that bounces around and when it hits the walls it goes somewhere else.

		Thanks<br />
<br />
And the suggestion is useful, camera rotation is really not impressive in this preset, (it exists with help of the new 3d triangle renderer, and is application of &quot;camera tilt&quot;, vertical camera rotation, that was possible in it). Later I had improved camera engine, those inv-s resulted in some new presets, but I am still have not good 3d camera movement formulas. Therefore for now, latest versions of those recent projects are still interactive. (even more, camera rotation should be always combined with movement).<br />
<br />
Btw, 3d engine in TL Room is not the 100% real 3d rotation - <br />
in TL Room in doesn't cause quality loss, but if applied in other preset - it may work incorrectly. One of other engines works as real (err correct) rotation - it is too complicated, so its application in TL Room wouldn't make sense.<br />
<br />
I will *try to* seek for new ways to make it (err presets that will be made) a good visualization.
