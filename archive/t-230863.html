      <p class="post-content"><strong>apply preset across multiple presets</strong><br />
      I'd like to be able to apply a preset across multiple presets. Sort of like,<br />
      <br />
      Select all the presets in a folder<br />
      <br />
      Hit the + button &gt; Presets &gt; preset i want to apply<br />
      <br />
      and it adds the preset to all the presets I have selected.<br />
      <br />
      This is because i'm to lazy to individually modify each preset to add a preset that I want. Basically i'd like to add a countdown timer to all my presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If I'm understanding this right, get Visbot's Third Season and take a look at nemo's 'edit the explode'. As his comment states, "In theory, if organized correctly, you could actually put all your presets into one preset and control it all with the effect list." If this is what you're looking for, I'd say this is your best bet.<br />
      <br />
      I created a sort of test for this as well, using all the presets from my next pack. But since it isn't released yet, I'm not putting it here to ruin the surprise. :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">too many presets in a preset may causing a low frame rate.. i hate that a lot!~ :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok I looked at it, wasn't what I was lookin for.<br />
      <br />
      I'd just like to add a timer to all my presets without having to go into each individual one to add it. ($playlength) - ($playpos) = time<br />
      <br />
      Sort of like when you highlight a bunch of files in windows explorer, right click, sendto. Except i'd like to highlight a bunch of AVS presets, right click, addpreset and have it add whatever preset I like to all the highlighted avs's.<br />
      <br />
      Make sense?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I had a little song position bar at the bottom of almost all presets of my 1st pack and I simply made a preset with that in. I din't found it to be too time-consuming to press "+ &gt; preset &gt; Grandchild &gt; position bar" and extract the scope from the EL, but it could be a nice tweak in a hopefully forthcoming version of AVS.</p>

      </blockquote>i messed around with this a lot at one point, and its the sort of thing that i have done in a lot of intro/would be intro type presets. to be honest it still hits the performance if you want to do anything non-trivial, because using code for the effect list is not cheap in practice. like two alternating effect lists are always slower than just one effect list<br />
      <br />
      as for the feature toqer wants... dream on. thats way too specific to ever get used enough to be worth it.

      <p class="post-content">So, the performance loss that an inactive effect list (enabled=0) causes, is still so noticeable?<br />
      I always thought that something like "enabled=regXX" wouldn't take much more speed than a similar single line of code in any other effect. :igor:<br />
      But i guess i should've known that earlier, since code-processing in AVS is really weird... ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I always thought it would be a really fast check, like "yes" (follow instructions) or "no" (ignore instructions and go to the whatever comes below this list).</p>
