<div class="posttext">Take a look at it and rate it here. I know some of the dynamic distance movement is basic, but it yet rocks. That is my opinion though, not everyones, I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Too n00bish.  Write your own DDM code- you just used the premade one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th July 2003, 22:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok. Got a site I can go to to get the coding then? I will go there and examine how to make such efforts. I just need to catch up on the coding you know... Thanks for the rate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Did, I am just using some of the ideas and crediting of course in the comment part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th July 2003, 22:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">This is the new improved one. I credited m^2k upon it in the comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">pffft...you don't have to credit me for helping, only if I remix it.<br />
<br />
Somewhat better...but realize that since you do not use t or u in the pixel field, they are useless (in a DDM, d is the only &quot;set&quot; variable).<br />
<br />
Try experimenting more with the code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 03:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright. I will credit you since you gave the code in one of the threads for dynamic distance, well one part of the dynamic distance modifier that I used for mine, thus I will. Thanks though, I will experiment tomorrow though, when I wake up since all of it is in my dad's computer in his and my step mom's room. I will continue to look back though, don't worry. I will use what you said as well. Thanks again.<br />
<br />
If not then I can use one of your examples in the forums and then credit you for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">On a 1-10 scale I give it a 3. I like the look of it and it goes well with my type of music. However, it does appear to look very similar of another preset. I don't know witch one but it looks very familiar to me. If it were your original work then I would give about a 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 04:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, well I am going to fix it Calrobowiz, lol. I can't get into the room now, since my dad and step mom is asleep in the room. I will post it here again, and thanks... I will try to change it a bit. If you find who idea it was, tell me so I can credit them in the comment parts of it. I want to give that person the credit too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright, when you do get home I will be grateful for you to tell me so I can put forth credit to the person in the comments section of my AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The new update of my AVS. I will continue to post my new updates on this thread. Comments and ratings are welcome as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Take out the Render Mode at the end - it doesn't do anything at the end of a preset.  I do not like the DDM's.  They just make it look kinda crappy in my opinion.  The texture is also way too grainy - don't use dot fountain and starfield - they make it much too grainy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright, no more fountain or starfield. Update!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Argh, what I meant was to replace them with something else(i.e. SSC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmmmm.... Confusion!! GWAHAHA!!! Alright, like a Superscope? I can try that, yeah. Just let me mess with it and I will submit it back here when I have completed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Calrobowiz</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It's looking better! Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 16:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks a lot, took an idea from Raz, but of course, I gave him credit of his idea with adding his name to my Comments list. A little light show is on there now, a superscope of intensity, you may ask. If it looks good, I shall keep it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Some bugs/optimizations with the SSC:<br />
1.  You don't use d and r in the SSC, so you can delete there expressions.<br />
2.  The SSC doesn't move on the y axis and you add ay to y, but you never coded ay, just ax.<br />
3.  The SSC doesn't move over the entire screen(I don't know if you meant to do this or not).<br />
<br />
Here is the SSC after I edited it.<br />
<br />
Init:<br />
n=800; pi=acos(-1)<br />
Beat:<br />
rx1=rand(100)/50-1;ry1=rand(100)/50-1<br />
Frame:<br />
ax=ax*0.9+rx1*0.1;ay=ay*.9+ry1*.1<br />
Pixel:<br />
x=cos(i*pi*30)*i*.1+ax; y=sin(i*pi*30)*i*.1+ay;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks once again anubis, looks a lot better now. Here it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Much better.  There seems to be a bit too much color, though when the colorfade and clear screen kick in.  This could be a nice black and white preset if you took the color out.  Would look kinda like a flashlight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, so you just want me to take 'em both out? I will see how they look and all. If it looks better, than I will send it back in here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I dunno.  You could try a white unique tone.  Don't know how that will look.  The color just looks kinda bad, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:49</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, the Unique tone was kinda ok, but didn't really calm my nerves down, lol. So I just deleted it and reput the colorfade back in and the Onbeat color clear. I think it kinda looks better than before, less of those blinding and somewhat ugly tye dye colors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 17:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Last thing I'm going to say:  Instead of using the color cycler in the SSC, use the variables red, green, and blue.  One possibility(just add this to the SSC):<br />
<br />
BEAT:<br />
dr2=rand(100)/100;dg2=rand(100)/100;db2=rand(100)/100<br />
FRAME:dr1=.9*dr1+.1*dr2;dg1=.9*dg1+.1*dg2;db1=.9*db1+.1*db2;red=dr1;green=dg1;blue=db1<br />
<br />
That should be better.  Note: I didn't test this code - there may be errors, but I think it's correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th July 2003, 18:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, thats all for me too, looks pretty good except the new code, it is good, but then again it wouldn't move around correcly, it would stay in the middle and just do nothing, lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heck, you need some type of credit. Take a look though. Looks a lot better I think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, i dont think i should get some credit. All i did was put together Anubis's code to make you understand.<br />
Anyway i remixed your preset hope you like it:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol, i thought no one would like that:eek:<br />
<br />
my account is allright again!!!woohoo!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 17:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I would say it is... but I will not submit it as my own... It is not my work, it is yours since it is a remix. Better though. Way better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Calrobowiz</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 17:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Why didn't you think no one would like it Ishan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 18:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmmmm, it is his though, and I think it is great too. Still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Calrobowiz</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 20:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well I'm sure you submit both as long as you give Ishan credit for the remix. But there is no need for full credit. (Sorry Ishan I'm not trying to put words in your mouth or anything.) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2003, 20:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I understand, but I only submitted the one that is my download. If he doesn't care I do submit it, then I will give him the credit, maybe full or 75 % of it and i only get like 25%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey check out this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=140630). It has a whole bunch of cool remixes of one of Ishan's presets. You need Color Map (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1646190)  for them to work properly though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">lord_zero_i</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th July 2003, 00:03</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Yeah, lol. I might not have Color Map. I don't know whats on my dads computer, lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well you can down load it if you don't have it. Just check in the AVS Config to see if it is there. It will be under the &quot;Trans&quot; menu.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This seems like old news and all but I have to submit my latest update on my AVS preset, Mysterious Beat Beauty. It was the original one, not the re-mix. I will put a downloadable zip here and let you all see it for yourself. Rate it if you want to. The rating scale will be 0 to a 5, 0 being terrible and 5 being astounding. Please comment upon it even though it is old news and should stay in the past.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks man. Well I added a few touches to it though. The newest update was moving some things around. Simple things. It will never be completed though. :D I will continue to update it. I will post the newest update of the AVS tomorrow. For now I will just look at it and see any other problems that I can find and fix them or maybe add some things to it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My update. I wanted to edit the previous one but I can't since the time for modifiying the message expired already. Well here is the update and sorry for this sentence to be semi-big. Well I hope the newest update looks good though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">.. Well I am sorry, I don't like the invert effect for mine, looks too crappy. I will try something else though. Oh yeah Ishan, I just don't want to use the same layout for mine on the remix. I will still use it though since you did modify mine which was mine in the first place. As usual you get credit for the remix though. It is wrong to take full credit for it. I will see what I can do with mine to make it less dark. Just be patient and keep coming back for more updates or whatnot.</div></div><hr />
