Why do i only pull 20-30fps? and thats when running at <br />
400*300@32bpp<br />
<br />
fast software bpp conversion - no, but no effect when on or off<br />
pixel doubling - no, cause it looks sh1t<br />
page flipping yes, i want it smooth<br />
wait for retrace - no, no effect<br />
<br />
i have a good system and would like to use it more at my work, but i need a higher quality than 400*300. <br />
<br />
Id like to run at 1024*768 16/32bit at approx 30-40fps<br />
<br />
ps i run Unreal Tournament at 110fps with all textures and at 1024*768 32bit with no problems.<br />
<br />
(and its sweet)<br />
<br />
mmm<br />
<br />
thx<br />
<br />
k<br />

<div class="posttext">AVS is NOT hardware accelerated and never will be.  It will get crap at 32bits no mater what system you have.  Try 16 bits with pixel doubling on.  Remember that AVS is a 2D system and the greatest 3D card in the world means jack-shit to it.  If you need large High quality visualizations try Milkdrop (http://www.nullsoft.com/free/milkdrop/) or some other plug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Set your system to run at 1152x864x32 with pixel doubling on and a vertical screen height of 90. Tweak around with it from there to get a satisfactory frame rate. My computer is a little bit slower than yours and I can get pretty good frame rates at around that setting.<br />

<div class="posttext">Never use AVS in 16-bit. Internally, all processing is done in 32-bit (wrote an explanation about it in an earlier thread), so all you gain is an extra conversion and more slowdowns.<br />
<br />
Back in the old days, 320x240 was a luxury :)<br />
Besides, AVS's power lies not in the multitude of pixels, but rather in the intensity of the calculations that each pixel goes through, which more than makes up for the low resolution if you have a good preset. If you want 30fps @ 1600x1200, try Milkdrop, but it won't close to as interesting as AVS.<br />
<br />
PS: If you suspect it's been asked before, SEARCH the forum before showing that you're too lazy.</div></div><hr />

Man, you got a 19 gigahertz CPU?!?  Suffering succotash!!  AVS should definately be running a lot better than it is on your system man :)</div></div><hr />
