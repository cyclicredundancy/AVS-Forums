<div class="posttext">Hello.<br />
<br />
I have made a preset what you can get from attachment, like you will see its a cube with light source, i think its correct way of doing this.<br />
well problem is this: i can get only 8 fps @ 256x256 and i want to set cube eges n what camera isn't showing to zero (camera shows maximum number of 3 edges at the time, i can cut half of the ssc's and get huge ammount of fps :D), i have tryed but im doing things really wrong and i get nothing good. <br />
help would be very welcome.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I downloaded your preset, But I can't see your AVS. I see just black screen without any cube.<br />
My frame rate in big window is: 5.5 FPS @ 284 * 198<br />
My frame rate in small window is: 5.7 FPS @ 196 * 112<br />
<br />
I hope I can help you. I run Winamp 2.91</div></div><hr />
