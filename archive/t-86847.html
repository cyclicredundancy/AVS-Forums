<div class="posttext">I was just wondering if people had the same problem as me. Yesterday I decided to get the latest version (I have been using 2.78c). It worked alright, then it started locking up when I started it, and the music would cut out while running AVS though the visuals kept going. I downgraded to 2.79 and it started up fine, but the AVS thing still happened. I went back to 2.78 and it works fine.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have something like that happen?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Maybe the newer version has lower-sized buffers by default? I'm really not sure... the version list only mentions this:<br />
<br />
2.80<br />
- fixed drag and drop from open file dialog related bugs <br />
- made CDDB support better handle not-found CDs/lack of CDDB installed <br />
- update to CDDB ui (bugfix) <br />
- new splash screen <br />
- minibrowser security fix <br />
- included PP's hacks for slightly better unicode filename support <br />
- in_wave support for floating point .WAV files fixed <br />
- better win9x compatibility for DirectSound <br />
- waveOut made skip less <br />
- some in_mod per-file fixes <br />
- OGG Vorbis support for Standard and Full installs <br />
<br />
2.79<br />
- upgraded unzip/decompress support to zlib 1.1.4, for big security fix <br />
- improved multiple instance detection code/opening many files from explorer issues <br />
- winamp agent tooltip improvement <br />
- updates to MIDI support, disk writing support, WAV file support (PP) <br />
- fix to id3v2+unicode support (rOn) <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm experiencing some more AVS weirdness too by the way. I have a preset which works perfectly when winamp is not playing music, but as soon as I click the play button, AVS crashes. I don't have it on this computer though, but I'm going to send it in next weekend to see if you guys have the same problem.</div></div><hr />

You could just be using too many variables.  I've experienced a lot of trouble when I'm writing SS or DM code, as AVS keeps every variable that has been created in it's memory, even if it's not being used.  That means if you change all your variable names, AVS keeps the old ones in it's memory - and if it's something like from &quot;wxpri&quot; to &quot;iwxt&quot; you get &quot;wxpr,&quot; &quot;wxp,&quot; &quot;wx,&quot; and &quot;wxt&quot; all stored in your memory.  Try doing that with 6 of them and all of the sudden Winamp crashes (even though Winamp and AVS are both still running).<br />
<br />
But that applies to using too many in general.  When I was trying to optimize a whirlpool-movement (like yours in Comotose Enlightenment) which was using 4 sets of coordinates, Winamp crashed, then when I tried to open it again, it still crashed - but it only crashed on the first beat when a lot of the variables were being initialized.  I had to go into the actual source code and edit it there so I didn't lose the work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I figured that was the problem, but all of my variables are normally initialized in the init. It works great until I hit play... and I don't think onbeat is always triggered on a new song.<br />
<br />
I know about the many-variables problem, but even resetting AVS causes this weird behaviour.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, I don't know exactly what nullsoft has done with .79 and .80 but I know experience crash in AVS that didn't happened with .78 and earlier...As I don't really mind of new winamp bugfixes and addons, I continue using .78 to work (play:)) with AVS</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">maybe it has something to do with windows xp.  i use win 98 and everything is ok</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Another bug I've noticed is that, for example:<br />
<br />
x=1/0<br />
<br />
Will result in winamp ignoring the equation. But:<br />
<br />
a=0; b=1; x=b/a<br />
<br />
will result in winamp *almost* stalling completely, avs going slow, and eventually music starting to skip horribly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Divisions by zero are tricky to avoid... like doing square-roots on negative numbers. I just tried plugging your code into a preset and it worked fine though.<br />
<br />
What I do know is that line-superscopes can sometimes slow down when you give them huge out-of-bound values (this can happen with 3D SSCs when you don't check if the z coordinate is close to 0). I think it's trying to draw the entire line instead of chopping it off at the edges of the window.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's not XP fault coz I've tried on my 3 PCs (1 WIN98 and 2 WinXP) and I still have more AVS hangs with winamp 2.79 and 2.80 (the crashes seems to appear randomly with no reasons...) If someone could report that to Nullsoft team...</div></div><hr />
