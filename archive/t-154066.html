			<strong>Texer II alpha</strong><br />
		
		

		After an afternoon of trying to iron out the final showstoppers, texer 2 is finally working ;). Changes with texer 1:<br />
<br />
- Support for all blend modes (use Misc / Set Render Mode)<br />
- Support for resizable particles<br />
- Includes a standard bitmap (thanks Tuggummi)<br />
<br />
And finally, it's now directly codable so this means:<br />
- Subpixel accuracy when resizing is on<br />
- Overlapping particles are possible<br />
- No more disappearing particles at the edges<br />
<br />
Get it from:<br />
<a href="http://acko.net/t2/texer2.zip" target="_blank">http://acko.net/t2/texer2.zip</a><br />
<br />
Includes two 3D presets showing off how to use the resize ability for 3D particle rendering. Basically you set sizex and sizey to 1/z.<br />
<br />
The help is still to-do (I mailed justin to ask if it's possible to include the standard help panel like in a superscope/dm), but you shouldn't have much trouble with it because it behaves mostly like a superscope.<br />
<br />
It seems stable here, but crashes are always possible. However because it uses the AVS scripting library, it's possible that one of the AVS bugs can trigger when working with Texer2, and there's not much I can do about that.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, I need a couple of simple examples for inclusion. If anyone feels up to it ;).<br />
<br />
This version is not final, but the code interface won't change anymore. Only bugfixes/additions.

		Very nice! This will be incredibly useful. I just had a thought now though - is it possible to code the T2 so that you could use a buffer save as the image, or would that be too slow?

		Well I'd like to stay away from 3D except very simple examples (like in the SSC), but your oscilloscope dots are a great example of a 2D texer.<br />
<br />
BTW if you're going to do 3D, you should use resizing, it looks much more correct.<br />
Set sizex and sizey to 1/z.

		Ok I uploaded a new texer:<br />
<br />
- Fixed bug, the non-scaling render didn't draw the last column/row of an image<br />
- Added b variable<br />
- Included 4 examples<br />
- Mentioned skip variable (set skip=1 to abort drawing a particle)<br />
- Shouldn't crash on older AVSes, instead it will put out a message and refuse to work.<br />
<br />
Daemon/gaekwad2: I modified your examples a bit to be clearer, if you don't want this just tell me and I'll remove them. I will credit you both in the help once I integrate with the rest of the AVS help.<br />

		I'd be honoured!<br />
btw I just realized that if you size them with something/w (or h) you can make the particle size stay the same independent of resolution.<br />
Didn't crash on 2.60 but I didn't see any message either.

		In the beat-responsive circle example, you forgot to remove the point variable ;).<br />
<br />
I assume the variable skip means how many beats to skip?<br />
<br />
Again, great work :)<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
Damn, I love it that UnconeD uses some of my work as example in this best APE yet :D. Thank you very much for it.<br />
<br />
PS. In the final version, can you please credit me for it in the documentation or whatever? A personal AVS friend of me will never believe this :D<br />

		gaekwad2: Well it should put a message in the init box if you add a new Texer2  to a preset in AVS2.6-. It was just a little something I added quickly, I'd expect most new presets to be broken anyway on AVS2.6.<br />
<br />
sidd: if you set skip to 1 during the per-point code, the particle will not get drawn. Skip is reset for the next particle, so you do not need to unset it later. I thought it might be useful when speed is important to avoid drawing useless particles. And in fact Jaak suggested it as well (it was in it from the beginning, but I forgot to mention it).<br />
<br />
Daemon: actually, if you'd look at the code, you'd notice point is used a lot. Basically, you can't use 'i' for circles w/ texer2, because I goes from 0 to 1, and so one particle would get drawn twice in additive blend. I thought of this, but decided to keep the old SSC 'i' behaviour for compatibility, and because you can get around it by making your own point-counter like I did.<br />
And I already answered your credit question. Read more carefully :weird:.

		whoops, must've read over it. The changes you made in the code are fine by me, this is indeed much better to decipher for newbies as well :). About the point thingie, I missed the part that you used it in angle, so sorry 'bout that.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
I'm so honoured, I hardly dare to ask you one more thing. Please spell my name correct when adding credit to the help. It's Deamon, not Daemon. And I want to say this one more time: THIS IS A FUCKING GREAT APE! You rule, UCD, and I don't want to be a slimeball, I mean it.<br />

		w00t! Texer 2 kicks serious ass, and I anin't playing! Don't know if this is like one of the examples already given, since I haven't downloaded them yet, but here is mine, I might have gone a little bit over the top, but I think I do a good job of showing some off this Texer's feautures, i.e.-perpoint drawing, COLORS!, and resizing.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
I  would also like to ask if anyone could fix the aspect ratio parts, I don't know if I did them right off the top of my head, and I slso did not put any on the X or Y variables, just on sizex and sizey.<br />

		Man this ape is sick :). You make kick ass presets, but your apes, this is where your skils realy blast off. And its fucking fast as well. There was a strange thing that happend yesterday when i tried it out (i couldnt resist even though im being crushed by giant piles off work). I tried to use it as a render for a raytraced picture (just ported the VissBizz code and made the grid cover the screen to get a 50*50 picture) and even when i turned off color check and resizeing some points didnt get rendered (the ball). I used 'k' to set the size of pictures (which gave some sort of a raster image. How come they didnt draw? I couldnt experiment more because of lack of time but I thought that if I turend both options off the damn thing should be picturles (all points same size and color). I gues I dont get the thing :D.<br />
I know I shouldnt bug you with this but isnt this code allmost a ssc, could you make one with codable line width.I gues all thats missing is a decent line function. Am I wrong? Please tell if I am so that I can get the idea out of my head.<br />
<br />
And the most important thing, thank you:).<br />
<br />
p.s. the bitmap menu going out off the config looks cool:D.

		JPGs would be mostly useless because it deals with small pictures usually. I won't implement GIF support for <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/" target="_blank">various reasons</a>, though I might consider PNG/MNG if I can get that to work.

		Bug detected:<br />
<br />
Loading huge pictures will cause Winamp to crash. I currently use the Wa2.91 with avs2.7pre8.<br />
<br />
This is not really a problem because why the hell would someone like to texer a 800*600 image? But sometimes i accidently picked one and its fucking annoying to loose your code...<br />
<br />
I guess that texerII is not able to buffer such big images. <br />
<br />
Either please preread the size and pop up a message if it is above a certain size saying that it cannot be loaded or fix it so it will work with any size.<br />

This ape is just for point drawing purposes, those points will get replaced with a picture of your choice and resized by code.<br />

		Another bug:<br />
Resizing cuts off border pixels.<br />

		Actually that's not a 'bug' per se, it's 'by design'.<br />
<br />
The texels on the edge of the texture-image are placed on the border of the rectangle of the particle. So 'the area of influence' of those texels is smaller. If I didn't do this, then the texels on the edge would have to blend with non-existant ones outside the image, which would require me to check the bounds of every single pixel (slow) or add a border around the image which duplicates the outer texels.<br />
<br />
If you want to show your border texels, you need to manually add a border around your image. I chose this approach because it's the most flexible one. For example in additive mode, you'll want a black border around your image. With replace mode you'll want a 'duplicate pixels' border. With subtractive 2, you'll want a white border. Etc.<br />
<br />
Bilinear filtering is messy on the inside because of this.<br />
<br />
I did just change the code around a bit to be extra greedy with texels (causes a difference of half a texel or so), so as much border area as possible is covered, so perhaps it's better now. But if you want your border texels to be blended to the outside of the particle as well, you need to manually add a border.

		By the way, I've been experimenting with the 'large images crash Texer 2' and the results are weird.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it works perfectly (I tried with both an 800x600 and a 4096x4096 picture) and sometimes it crashes in DDRAW.DLL (DirectDraw). The problem is that the error is caught by some internal handler (either Winamp or DDraw's) so I can't debug it easily.<br />
<br />
In any case, my code was written to go up to 32767x32767 pictures without problems. Above that, integer overflow occurs (I use signed 16.16 fixed point for the bilinear filtering).<br />
<br />
I'll try and see what's causing it, but to be honest I have no idea. The only thing I can think of is that a large image causes a certain process to take longer than it should, and a crash occurs during a normally instantaneous process.<br />
I put my image loader inside a so called  'critical section' that is exclusive with the rendering code, so that no race conditions can happen.<br />
<br />
Also, the particles will get clipped to the AVS window, so a huge image shouldn't offer any more problems than one as a big as the window.

		@Horsefly: If all pixels are of the same color, they should be easily zipped down to floppy size :p<br />
<br />
@UCD: Ff everything fails just make sure that large pictures won't be loaded or even better, are excluded from the load-image combobox. Maybe add a checkbox &quot;use images above xxx*xxx too&quot; so we could still use em on our own risk. This is the best solution imho as long as the error cannot be traced back.

		If i'ts caused by a thread-delay, noone can tell. You'd have to limit it to a reasonable size (eg 100*100) which should work on most pc's (we'd have to test it on some really od and crappy machines).<br />
<br />
But how comes that this bug does only exist since texer2? The old version should work the same way.

		Magic: I have no idea, which is why it's so darn hard to debug. The fact that it crashes in DDRAW.DLL makes it even weirder, because Texer2 gets nowhere near DirectX.<br />
On top of that, if it were a problem with not having the image loaded properly, it would crash in TEXER2.APE. The code only reads from the image data, so heap/stack corruption is out of the question.<br />
For now, I'm going to leave it like this.<br />
What is an 800x600 BMP doing in your AVS dir anyway? :weird:

<br />
If you choose one of the examples, and then change the texer image, and then change to another example, the image goes back to the default image.<br />
<br />
This is fine, but the image listbox doesnt update. It still says whichever one you selected before, even though the  default one is being used.<br />
<br />
Also, i got a crash once when i mouse scrolled very quickely thought the list of texer images. But it hasnt happened since.

		Basically the help button opens up the same help dialog as the help button in the standard AVS components (superscope/dm/...) with a Texer 2 specific tab along side the others. In case you didn't know, this is one of the new things in AVS 2.7.<br />
<br />
Justin simply didn't implement any way for APEs to use this dialog until pre9.<br />
<br />
Here's the text in the texer 2 tab:<br />

	<blockquote>
			
				Texer II is a rendering component that draws what is commonly known as particles.<br />
At specified positions on screen, a copy of the source image is placed and blended in various ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
The usage is similar to that of a dot-superscope.<br />
The following variables are available:<br />
<br />
* n: Contains the amount of particles to draw. Usually set in the init code or the frame code.<br />
<br />
* w,h: Contain the width and height of the window in pixels.<br />
<br />
* i: Contains the percentage of progress of particles drawn. Varies from 0 (first particle) to 1 (last particle).<br />
<br />
* x,y: Specify the position of the center of the particle. Range -1 to 1.<br />
<br />
* v: Contains the i'th sample of the oscilloscope waveform. Use getspec(...) or getosc(...) for other data (check the function reference for their usage).<br />
<br />
* b: Contains 1 if a beat is occuring, 0 otherwise.<br />
<br />
* sizex, sizey: Contain the relative horizontal and vertical size of the current particle. Use 1.0 for original size. Only works if resizing is on.<br />
<br />
* red, green, blue: Set the color of the current particle in terms of its red, green and blue component. Only works if color filtering is on.<br />
<br />
* skip: Default is 0. If set to 1, indicates that the current particle should not be drawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The options available are:<br />
<br />
* Color filtering: blends the image multiplicatively with the color specified by the red, green and blue variables.<br />
<br />
* Resizing: resizes the image according to the variables sizex and sizey.<br />
<br />
* Wrap around: wraps any image data that falls off the border of the screen around to the other side. Useful for making tiled patterns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Texer II supports the standard AVS blend modes. Just place a Misc / Set Render Mode before the Texer 2 and choose the appropriate setting. You will most likely use Additive or Maximum blend.<br />
<br />
Texer II was written by Steven Wittens. Thanks to everyone at the Winamp.com forums for feedback, especially Deamon and gaekwad2 for providing the examples and Tuggummi for providing the default image.</blockquote>

I recently installed the new DX9b and all of a sudden i could use large images! Crashes still happen now and then but basically it works now even with those f**king huge bitmaps.<br />

As you pointed out before, tex2 does'nt use DX, but check this yourselfes. Maybe you should add the advice to upgrade DX to your help.
