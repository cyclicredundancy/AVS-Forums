			<strong>Any idea how...</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I've been trying to figure out how to do this for a while.<br />
If you have a ssc that makes a circle that doesn't completely close (kind of like a C but closer) and the gap is the same width as each point is from another, how would you get the gap to remain the same size as each other side as the diameter and points increase/decrease?<br />
Have a look at the attached preset if you don't quite follow me.<br />
<br />
I've got it as close as i can, but there has to be a proper way to do it.

		I'm not sure, I haven't checked the preset out yet, but I think it would have something to do with scaling it a certain way. I'll get back to you if I find something out ok.

		I hope I understood your request (cause of using AVS 2.6 I couldn't load your example :( )<br />
<br />
You're looking for a superscope ring, almost closed, with a certain sized gap. This gap has to keep its proportion, when changing the points.<br />
<br />
At least, that's what this one does...
