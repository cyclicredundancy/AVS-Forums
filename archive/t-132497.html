      Basically I want to see an option to remove the title bar on the AVS so that the visualization can blend into the background or whatever.<br />
      <br />
      Notes on the screenshot: The taskbar is transparent and the AVS rests behind it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow, nice idea there...<br />
      <br />
      If the titlebar size can be adjusted with skins, then it shouldn't be too hard, but since I believe we can't...<br />
      <br />
      There are no known way to do that (at least to me). Sorry :/<br />
      <br />
      You're using 1024x768 reso... So I *think* you can blend using overlay... But it's full-replace, so the taskbar would be weird.</p>

      I would love it if the AVS didn't have the title bar. It would mean that I could move the AVS anywhere I want and it would blend in with the environment.<br />
      <br />
      shrruggg... 800x600 is a small resolution, hungryskull. I'm glad I don't have to live with that. Having two monitors gives me a lot of space to do whatever I want. I can watch my TV on one monitor and chat on the other. My friends are jealous, and you should be too. LOL.</p>

      My screen reso is 1280x1024, nicely sized... CRT, so yes, lots of space taken.<br />
      <br />
      Mod, lock please, lest someone have an idea on how to do a titlebar-less AVS window.<br />
      <br />
      One idea I have, howwever, is to make a skin for the window in which the titlebar color blends into the toolbar... Think that's a good idea?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just edit the avs skin bitmap and fill it with black color since you are using it against a black wallpaper. That should do it for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Umm. I didn't mean to rub anything into anyoneâ€™s face. Well the reason I don't want to edit the skin is that then, whenever I change skins I would have to change the color of the title bar. This is why I'm in the wish list section, so that this feature could be implemented in the future releases of AVS.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;i&gt;Basically I want to see an option to remove the title bar on the AVS so that the visualization can blend into the background or whatever.&lt;/i&gt;<br />

      With that said, this will be my last post. Thanks a lot for your input everyone.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This came up earlier in Plugins tech support...<br />
      my solution (don't know if this will work):<br />
      <br />
      write a simple app in c++ with the background of the standard overlay color. build it without a titlebar, just a plain window. Turn on overlay, and it should work.</p>
