      <p class="post-content">It's totally fucking annoying, and I find it rather insulting that they'd shunt AVS for a fuckin video. Furthermore, I'd rather see Nullsoft come out with a playlistable video player instead of having a window pop up every time I tried to play one; let alone having my AVS dissappear entirely. For those who REALLY want to have AVS running in the background, listening to mp3s and videos, there should be a static window built into winamp, like the minibrowser.<br />
      <br />
      I REALLY don't want to see Winamp5 go the way of Winamp3 (y'know, with it sucking and all that). :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Really? This is fucking AOL we're talking about here, and you will note that Justin is leaving the team.<br />
      <br />
      And I forgot to mention: what if I *WANT* AVS running with a video? Like...most of the time I'm ever watching videos? I'm usually working on some AVS whenever I have Winamp open. And what the hell happens to the editor when a video comes up on the playlist? Just FOOM and right in the middle of trying to write something your prompt is gone? Not to mention the fact that it'll usually involve several keystrokes before you realize it's gone, which is chaos when you're typing fast and all of the sudden it switches windows on you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it would be fine to have AVS in the video window. If, when switching to a video, you have the AVS editor open, it should not show the video and just play the sound(or perhaps open a second video window - which would defeat the purpose of doing this in the first place, but whatever). If the editor is not open, then it could just switch to the video.<br />
      <br />
      Another thing that they could add to winamp - autosaving the preset that you're working on. If AVS crashes or if a video starts up, then your preset would still be fine and you could just tell AVS to open the last edited preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Anubis, having a video playing and NOT playing the video over it is an inherently STUPID idea. You also seemed to have ignored entirely the fact that you would lose AVS *over* videos. Selective myopyia, perhaps? Really, you said it yourself - keeping the second window for video is the best idea.<br />
      And autosaving has been discussed before, it's probably in the wishlist, somewhere.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, but there are some instances where you can't still save. Several times AVS has just frozen my computer.<br />

      <p class="post-content">there is a cure for that.<br />
      step one: download the new colormap<br />
      step two: save early, save often, dumbass<br />
      step three: reboot intermittently when writing code<br />
      <br />
      and perhaps we could suggest to them just not doing this in the first place, because it's a BAD idea? i also happen to agree with m2k...people are idiots, if their program twiddles on them the least bit and they don't know what's going on they panic. also, opening a new window for the video while avs is on completely defeats the purpose of putting them in the same window, so it's a moot point.</p>
