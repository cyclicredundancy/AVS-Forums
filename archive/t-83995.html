      I have a P4 1500 with 256 mb RAM and 3D prophet 4500. WHY my avs plug ins runs so slow?! AVS use my video card or only CPU? there's a setting for this?<br />

      <p class="post-content">AVS just uses the CPU.<br />
      <br />
      AVS always runs slow.<br />
      <br />
      You need a faster CPU. Try reducing the res and/or turning pixel doubling on (making it run at half res)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Whoa... you have almost 3x my processor speed...<br />
      <br />
      To me, 4-10 FPS is regular speed, and more than that, it's fast :p<br />
      Trust me, one day you'll find slow framerate to be better... (Gives you more time to [sarcasm] drool, realize you're drooling, then look again[/sarcasm] or just to have more time to enjoy the beauty...)<br />
      <br />
      What window resolution ya using? I used 328x328 (gonna soon change to 330x330,320x320, or 300x300 tho)<br />
      <br />
      328x328 is optimal window size for me... since you have a fast processor, 400x400 should be good enough.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OpenGL is not some magical potion that instantly speeds up an application. Acceleration something like AVS in hardware is not an easy thing to do, because after all, a 3d card is just a 'dumb' polygon rasterizer. Even the latest vertex and pixel shaders won't help much.<br />
      <br />
      I also know someone (you?) mentioned that OGL was tons better than Direct3D because it was faster: that's probably related to the drivers your manufacturer provides. Of course OGL has many advantages over D3D (cross-platform support, to name one), but in terms of speed they are roughly the same.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Childish</strong><br />
      Um excuse me Rovastar... the ironic 'AVS sucks' and 'Milkdrop sucks' discussion was fun, but lately you (and Illusion) have been taking every chance you have to crack down AVS, using exaggerated and/or incorrect arguments.<br />
      <br />
      "I get about 4 FPM (frames per minute)"<br />
      <br />
      "Use a low resolution, not 200 x 150"<br />
      <br />
      "Milkdrop allows you to do your own beat-detection, AVS doesn't"<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You don't see *us* doing this in your forum, right? Sorry, but this is just childish. If AVS really was so bad, how come there are tons of AVS presets? Because not everyone wants 1024x768 @ 30fps... and clearly the added possiblities are a valuable trade-off against speed and display resolution.<br />
      Sorry if Milkdrop doesn't have the user-base that AVS has, but that's not our fault. Why doesn't Ryan ask Justin to include it in the default Winamp package? And maybe Milkdrop's configuration interface just isn't as accessable as the drag'n'drop interface of AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Comments like those add nothing to the meaningful discussions that we're trying to have here. If you think AVS sucks, why do you spend all that time hanging around here? This is not something I'd expect a forum moderator to do.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Chill UnConeD the above comment was directed at Horse-Fly's<br />
      'well, use avs at fullscreen, but use it at lower resolutions, not 100000 X 1000000'<br />
      <br />
      I was simply redressing the balance. It usual for newbies to run graphical programs at a res of 800x600 upward esp if you have a PC built in the last 1 or 2 years. AVS displays all the reses available. it is only natural you do not select the lowest one!<br />
      I know why I run any other viz I choose a higher res than 300x400 or something.<br />
      <br />
      AVS is different to all that. People that do not know AVS get understandably very confused with this. Horse-Fly was trying to imply that GabboRasta was being greedy by select massive res when the reality was he probably using a res less then his desktop. A bit harsh I thought.<br />
      <br />
      Take my machine for example. I have a still fairly decent AMD TBird 1.333Ghz. (SO about the same real speed as the GabboRasta)<br />
      <br />
      If I run say your Pack II with 320x240x32 (True no pixel doubling) at Fullscreen with the Rendering Options half way. It never gets above about 12-13fps. Therefore even my sarcastic "Use a low resolution, not 200 x 150" does not seem that far from the truth. SO I am really 'using exaggerated and/or incorrect arguments.'<br />
      <br />
      For a newbie and the even more experienced among us may seem crazy.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to help GabboRasta concerning this in this thread.<br />
      <br />
      So please put these comments in context.<br />
      And I do not even mention MilkDrop in all of this.;)<br />
      <br />
      I don't think AVS sucks I still use AVS sometimes. Hell I have about 50 visuals on my machine I write presets/tutorials for R2 and do loads of help with beta testing too and Tripex 3 as well. (These plug-ins do not have to run at 320x240 to get above 30fps. The public will a naturally get confused.)<br />
      <br />
      Sometimes I feel that the AVS community is a little 'sheltered' regarding new stuff. An example of this was the surprise of MilkDrop in our debate on these forums a few months ago now. Most had never even tried it let alone know you create your own effects until that thread was created. And people expect thing to run at a higher res now a days. People, rightly or wrongly, expect to use their 3d cards.<br />
      <br />
      My comments try and reflect this.<br />
      <br />
      I also stick by my beat detection comments. As I have never seen any other beat detection other than the only 'average' built in BPM counter so I presumed that AVS does not do this or people do not understand how to do it. Please show me some.<br />
      <br />
      The only thing that annoys me about AVS is all you lot hogging the new preset section on the website so I cannot see when a new preset is released as it has been flooded with AVS 'plug-ins'.;)<br />
      <br />
      'You don't see *us* doing this in your forum, right?'<br />
      <br />
      Err......I have seen a fair few of *you* on the Smoke forums.......Nuff Said.<br />
      <br />
      'Because not everyone wants 1024x768 @ 30fps'<br />
      <br />
      Are you really saying that you do not want AVS to run at 1024x768@30fps? Come on UnConed you'll love it. If I offered you a nice 2.5Ghz PC now I am sure you would take it.:)<br />
      <br />
      Anything below 20 fps has poor beat detection for a start. A load of other new Plug-ins want you to run them at 60fps+.<br />
      <br />
      Everyone wants things quicker and better. And there is nothing wrong with questioning why something is slow. Hell I hopefully have found a way of increasing MilkDrop’s speed for most presets by up to 20%. This will make things better. Questioning stuff is always good. Too often I have seen answers to questions of ‘it has always done that’ or ‘that is the best we can do’ only for a better solution to be available.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I digress.<br />
      <br />
      The majority of my posts here are informative and try and help the people.<br />
      <br />
      I thought you would understand that. :confused:<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">I do have to admit, that it is true that most people might have a newer PC, that has a pretty good vid card up and running, that will get milkdrop to run 40+fps.<br />
      <br />
      but i bet the most people lok at AVS and then Look At Milkdrop and say 'What the hell? they look somewhat the same, then why the hell so i get shitty frame rate with AVS at lower resolutions <i>in Windowed mode!</i>' then post threads saying <i>'why cant AVS be OpenGL rendered??'</i>.<br />
      <br />
      both of you are right:<br />
      AVS uses Direct3d/DirectDraw and Milkdrop uses OpenGL rendering, and Milkdrop runs faster at higher resolutions becuase of this.<br />
      AVS is Customisable, thus have a shit loads of avs packs for it on <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/winamp.com" target="_blank">winamp.com</a></i>, Both i think have pretty good beat detection regaurdless of frame rate. Both are good Visualizations, and both are powerful in their own right.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Rovastar: if your intentions were to redress the balance, why did you make it sound that even 200x150 was too much? The other quotes I provided were exactly the same (and I feel they were just the same in context as out of context).<br />
      <br />
      We've had this discussion a million times. Yes, AVS would be *better* if it was faster and ran smoother on higher resolutions. But that doesn't mean that it's worthless in its current form... you make it sound as if it is.<br />
      <br />
      I also don't understand this:<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        If I run say your Pack II with 320x240x32 (True no pixel doubling) at Fullscreen with the <u>Rendering Options half way</u>
      </blockquote>Are you referring to the Rendering Performance slider at the bottom of the Fullscreen options in AVS? Right below it, it says "Higher framerate --- lower framerate". And you're complaining about the framerate when it's only set halfway? I don't get it.<br />
      <br />
      You also make it sound as if we've never tried Milkdrop in our whole life. I don't know about the others, but that's not true. The reason I use AVS is because it allows me to plug effects together in various ways. Milkdrop is essentially (in AVS terms) a 'superscope + DM' combination, along with various drawing options related to fade out, brightness, etc. If I look at my packs, I know that 99% of the presets I make are not possible to recreate in Milkdrop.<br />
      <br />
      Also as far as the beat detection thing, if you wish to use AVS's built-in beat detection, you can go right ahead and plug your code into the handy onbeat code boxes. If not, you can simply use getosc and getspec to access any and every portion of the sound data that Winamp provides to plug-ins to do your own beat-detection, just you like you guys do for Milkdrop (except that it calculates a few variables for you). Of course, it's not newbie friendly, but neither is doing beat-detection yourself in Milkdrop.<br />
      <br />
      I also don't see how me posting in one thread in the smoke forums is the same as this. The only reason I posted is because BlurPak2k1 used the smoke forum to ask Ryan Geiss to create a 3D accelerated AVS.<br />
      <br />
      If it was meant to be a joke, sorry, but it most definately came across as mockery to me (that's why I provided the quotes that made me write this post in the first place). And if you insult AVS, you're insulting everyone who spends his time creating and watching presets, because you're telling them that what they do is worthless.

It dosent matter some people like one and some people like another.. BTW UnConeD you shouldnt jump the gun about things like that....... Try and take a joke.. I like AVS and Milkdrop both but Illusion was joking not trying to insult AVS.....<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK when I said *you* in the *'s. It was in the context of *us*. That you mentioned before. I took that to mean the AVS community. That is what I was referring too. That is why I used the *'s. I was quoting you so it stayed in context. OK.<br />
      <br />
      It was not directed at you more at the AVSer's BlurPak2k1/Scarface2k2 (maybe now I feel the same person . \me more confused (posts as I have been writing this it is more clear)) with his unhelpful comments. His latest round was...well....I don't know. :confused:<br />
      <br />
      The majority off my posts are to be helpful (that is how I started when replying to this thread) when posting here occasionally me and you (I thought at least) had a joke about the two systems.<br />
      <br />
      And the 'same as this' same as what mate? There is no ill feeling from my part here.<br />
      <br />
      Just as Horse-Fly's res of '100000 X 1000000' was sarcastic, Mine was too. It was only a little banter.<br />
      <br />
      About my settings I was trying to show people on the board what a newbie’s settings may be. And why there is so much confusion. I am not insulting AVS in this post. Maybe I did not explain that properly.<br />
      <br />
      About the beat detection there are hundred of thousands of presets there. How many do there own beat detection? I have not any so that is why I presume that there was none that you could do yourself. What I said preciously was in response (I believe) to the line-in and not getting the beat. I was saying that there are alternatives available.<br />
      <br />
      I have still to see 20 lines of code working out what the beat is doing.<br />

      I know you have tried MD UnConeD but the evidence was in the MD vs AVS thread (A thread started by the AVS community not me) and the number of download of the zip that we created there as to the lack of interest in something new.<br />
      <br />
      As for your packs true most of them (maybe all) cannot be created in MilkDrop but I could also say the same thing about many of my better/complex ones and AVS. You are oversimplifying MilkDrop. They are different they do different things. Just swings and roundabouts really.<br />

      <br />
      First of all, I don't have 3d video card... That means Milkdrop v.s. AVS outta my head.<br />
      <br />
      Ok, let's make the rest quickly...<br />
      <br />
      What Framerate ya got? A lot (if not most) of the best presets are unfortunately slow - But it trades off...<br />
      4-10 FPS is acceptable, remember that : Otherwise, get used to it! Sides, I can't imagine watching "Zero-G Maze" at high FPS... Remember the name : Zero-G. No gravity... not-so-fast-human-propelled movement...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, Skarface2k2, I gotta say that you icon really matches the name.<br />
      <br />
      Tried Milk drop, didn't like it. To me a lot of the presets looked the same. I can say the same thing about AVS, but with AVS there is a whole lot more that things can look like. :p Either is fine if it floats your boat.<br />
      <br />
      I must agree a with Unconed though, I tire of the jabs, in both direction, a mite.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>ballance?</strong><br />
      huh..where did gabborasta get help here?<br />
      i mean normaly with life you ask and recieve...when it goes to negation and frightening the ballance can't work well..isn't that truth?<br />
      <br />
      yeah the subject here were to know if there were any way to get quality of speed and to frame per frame..<br />
      <br />
      you looks like old peoples fighting cause of the one stolen lolipop in their childhood.....<br />
      <br />
      ok...blame me if i'm wrong but the matter in aid is to aid when you've got a restaurent..and fight in the backroom...how'll the hungry one in the main room will get fed up?<br />
      <br />
      sad isn't it.....<br />
      <br />
      so then.....there should be an alternative farther than inside the software..<br />
      <br />
      like if you ask yourself to help yourself you won't go thus the limit<br />
      <br />
      if you ask your pals it's gona make twice the needed<br />
      <br />
      (this is to compare avs that got options and drivers/stuff)<br />
      <br />
      so if there is an alternative other than changing resolution<br />
      <br />
      (when i run my own avs in 320-x it goes about half a frame per second to 2 and i says truth...i'd be glad to get more quality too<br />
      <br />
      (ah yeah and the colorfading goes unfluid and it's ugly in lowres)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      so to conclude it<br />
      <br />
      i'm a fool who loves angry and happy peoples , the high and the low<br />
      and i think that if you're angry about someone you just have to tell him in private (this is old of hundreds of undreds)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      so see ya</p>
