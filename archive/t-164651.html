<div class="posttext">Not bad for a first. you can't really read the into preset though.<br />
<br />
Flaming Guitar:<br />
The movement of the srings on the guitar is nice, but the hand moves a bit much. It'd be better if how much it moved depended on the intensity of the music maybe.<br />
<br />
You didn't change the n value in your scopes. Tsk tsk. You don't need that many. You could also use two movement to get the picture looking right instead of two dynamoves.<br />
<br />
Jelly Jesus:<br />
Sacriligious, probably, but I'm agnostic so whatever. :) Dunno why it's so slow, but it is a tad too slow. Also, Jesus shouldn't jiggle without music. :p This is my favourite of the pack though.<br />
<br />
Partiot II:<br />
I dunno, the while is just kind of overpowering. I know things are going on, but I can't see what because of all the white. Maybe if the reflection of the music was bigger or the bands were smaller.<br />
<br />
Smoking Beam:<br />
Not bad, close second to JJ. I'd do something with that wave though.<br />
<br />
You don't need 800 points to make a line. Just use two and set it to line instead of dot.<br />
<br />
Very Square:<br />
Not my cup of tea as preset go. Looks pretty cool, but it doesn't do much for me. Not really my style.<br />
<br />
Canazza Electric:<br />
Ah, now this is the kind of thing I'd expect from a noob. :) Flashy, lots of colour, and can't really see what's going on. Doesn't seem to have much music response either. Everyone's allowed one. :)</div></div><hr />
