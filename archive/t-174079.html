			<strong>(p)Reset button</strong><br />
		
		

		While creating synchnonized stuff, say 2 SSC's, I often need to close/open AVS because the scope I'm working on gets reset everytime I change something in it and the other SSC does not reset. You know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Now wouldn't it be an idea to have some sort of button that resets the preset? This prevents much irritation on my side because double clicking on the classic vis also toggles oscilloscope/spectrum/off. <br />
<br />
Downside: closing the AVS window saves the current preset (preset00.avs?) This has prevented quite some preset-losses due to WAcrashes, (although WA5 hardly crashes anymore on my PC) or perhaps this could be included in the function of the button...

		Just use global variables instead, and all your synchronization problems will be gone.

		or ctrl+shift+k but global variables are the best idea.

		I did write SS, but I had problem same as you.<br />
If next release of AVS will have this button it's pretty cool.

		There won't, Unconed is right. At first I thought there would be situations apart from DM's and SSC's that relied on it, but for as far as I can see there aren't, so just drop this. Globvars are the best solution.

		I have an addon to this. Open the AVS Debug window, then enable &quot;Clear all local variables on all code recompiles&quot;. This also clears the global values too.

		neo: Activating this option is the cause of the problem, not the solution.<br />
If you activate this option this happens:<br />
You change a code block, it is recompiled and the variables of that one component are reset.<br />
variables of other components and global vars are left untouched.<br />
<br />
Deactivating it could help keeping your scopes in sync when editing, except if you change your whatever-you-want-to-sync code.<br />
solution: as UnConeD said, use the registers to store those whatever-you-want-to-sync values :)
