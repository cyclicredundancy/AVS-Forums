      <p class="post-content">I'm pretty sure the AVS FAQ would've answered this, but bring up the AVS window (if it's not there at all then you've got a real problem), double-click to open the config window, then go to Settings-&gt;Display. Uncheck "Overlay mode"</p>

      <p class="post-content">Word of advice, don't go running into forums shouting 'H-E-L-P' 'I've got a problem!' 'pls help im going crazy'.<br />
      It makes you look like an annoying kiddie who hasn't read the proper documentation.<br />
      Instead, try explaining your problem in detail rather than assuming everyone knows what you mean with words like 'default config' (in this case, you apparently meant 'display it in a regular window').</p>

      </blockquote>well I actually assumed this was a forum which was frequented by experts who would know exactly what i meant when i said "default config"<br />
      <br />
      anyway i uninstalled the program as advised by Deamon....problem solved...<br />
      <br />
      so thanks to those who replied<br />
