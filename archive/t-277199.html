<br />
<div class="posttext">Umm I would download the pack, except that it just links to a jpg. (You may want to sort that out.)<br />
<br />
Also C++ and AVS are not the same.<br />
For AVS tutorials please have a look here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060).<br />
For C++ I would suggest having a look here (http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=c%2B%2B+tutorials&amp;meta=&amp;btnG=Google+Search).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay I've had a look through now :)<br />
<br />
The first thing that I noticed was the very small or non-existent reaction to music, which is kinda the point of AVS. (getspec() and getosc() are your friends :))<br />
<br />
Quite a few empty black background, generally that's not cool.<br />
<br />
Colour work is okay. You avoided mindlessly scrolling through the rainbow and the over done psychedelic look.<br />
<br />
The stand out preset of the pack for me is Cool2, if you made that actually react to music then it would be quite good.<br />
<br />
You seem to have good knowledge of how to layout a preset, all you really need to learn is how to do the coding.<br />
<br />
Your installer need some work as well, you only need to include the ape's etc that don't come with Winamp as standard that you use.<br />
/checks pack<br />
Yeah you only need to include that picture of you with your presets as the other bitmaps are standard too.<br />
Also make the installer check where the person has installed there Winamp, not everyone has in it C:\program files\winamp ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks for the comments man ,<br />
i am reading through the things u post there , on the way learning to code , this is my 1st pack so i don't know much bout codings so i decide only use very simple dm which i know to do all the presets , and the superscopes are all actually from the samples with a bit changes on them , i am quite confused with the getosc thing , btw why is the primer by atero cannot be download ?:cry:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">deviantart likes to lose peoples old work.<br />
PAK-9's tutorial is good.<br />
<br />
getosc(band,width,channel)<br />
  = returns waveform data centered at 'band', (0..1), sampled 'width' (0..1) wide.<br />
    'channel' can be: 0=center, 1=left, 2=right. return value is (-1..1)<br />
<br />
So to make a simple oscilloscope with a superscope the code would be:<br />
[Point]<br />
x=i*2-1;<br />
y=getosc(i,0,0);<br />
<br />
Click the expression help button and have a read through.</div></div><hr />
