		Your best bet is to use NSIS which is available for download from the winamp or the nullsoft site. If you need help, there were a couple of scripts posted here, and there is an entire forum dedicated to it.

		I have trouble with NSIS, I always get confused with something.  Is it an MS-DOS application?  If it is, that's probably why:( <br />
<br />
I have an installer called &quot;Spoon Installer.&quot; I can't say anything about it though because I haven't used it yet.

		Yeah NSIS is somewhat difficult to use, but many people have released their own generalized scripts for it. I haven't used it yet, but I don't think it's DOS.  And if using others scripts is still too difficult then you can use the winzip or winrar self executable creator, but they aren't that great.

		The one that I used was a command line app, but the flexability and freedom it affords you are great.
