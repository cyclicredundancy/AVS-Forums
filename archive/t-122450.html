      <p class="post-content">Your best bet is to use NSIS which is available for download from the winamp or the nullsoft site. If you need help, there were a couple of scripts posted here, and there is an entire forum dedicated to it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have trouble with NSIS, I always get confused with something. Is it an MS-DOS application? If it is, that's probably why:(<br />
      <br />
      I have an installer called "Spoon Installer." I can't say anything about it though because I haven't used it yet.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah NSIS is somewhat difficult to use, but many people have released their own generalized scripts for it. I haven't used it yet, but I don't think it's DOS. And if using others scripts is still too difficult then you can use the winzip or winrar self executable creator, but they aren't that great.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The one that I used was a command line app, but the flexability and freedom it affords you are great.</p>
