		Okay, so it's not exactly &quot;Bleeding edge&quot; but, it's a hell of a lot better than my last one. <br />
<br />
A quick question though, is there any &quot;Easy&quot; way for me to smooth it out a little bit?  If you watch it you'll notice that at certain times it really vibrates rapidly and sort of ruins the effect.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I'm not to good at this yet.  But every one I make gets better and better.  <br />
<br />
Someday......
