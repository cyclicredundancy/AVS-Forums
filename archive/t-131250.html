			<strong>I only see a black screen</strong><br />
		
		

		<font size="3">When I opened the visualization for the first time it worked fine.  Later, I tried it again and all that appeared was a blank black screen.  I tried re-installing winamp (full) and it still will not work.  I also tried adjusting the color.  What is the problem?</font>

		You didnt describe your problem properly so its difficlt to point out the problem, but heres what you can do:<br />
1) Check whether a preset is loaded, if no preset if loaded then you will not see anything. Right click on the AVS screen and select any preset from the list.<br />
2) Are you using fullscreen? On my pc, when I use Pixel doubling and resolution something X something X 32, I dont see anything.<br />
3) Is the song playing? some presets are so made that you cant see anything  if the song isnt playing. e.g UnconeD's energy ball.<br />
4)If the above solution doesnt work, then try uninstalling winamp, then delete the winamp directory ( make sure you have installers for all the components you have downloaded ) and then re-install winamp again.<br />
<br />
These are some of the common solution I could come up with. If it is anything to do with hardware, then sorry I cant help you.<br />
<br />
P.S :- Make sure monitor is turned on ;) :p

		Are you even using AVS. Visualisation is a vague word.
