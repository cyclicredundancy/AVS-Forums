      That hurt... Guess it IS real...<br />
      <br />
      Very good job UnConeD... I mean, Excellent job UnConeD...<br />
      <br />
      5.1 out of 5 stars (More than that, then it's exaggerated). they're the best things I've ever seen.<br />
      <br />
      I believe it's gonna be notably harder and harder to make better packs though... I don't think I can predict your next move =)<br />
      And heck, I think you had slightly enhanced the AVS making community by those nice Trans and Render APEs... (I doubt the render APEs gonna be used anymore though...)<br />
      <br />
      :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Steven, you are a living genius that definantly revelotioned the way of makin presets, i can't describe how good this pack is, the only thing bad thing is that there is only 12 presets and many of them is diffrent versions of of other presets, (steven, we want more)<br />
      and btw i love the APE's you made</p>

      <p class="post-content">&lt;sound of jaw hitting floor while watching nuclear warfare&gt;<br />
      <br />
      Hey, O think I can see my house...<br />
      <br />
      &lt;runs to window&gt;<br />
      <br />
      Oh crap. :eek: :cry:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Nice job.<br />
      <br />
      Onr little teeny weeny thing. I found that on pixel doubled 320x240 (I know, what the point?) on the ultra high quality nuclear warfare the water isn't blue (not for me anyway), it's black. That and the world dosn't show up at all until there's a beat in both versions. (If only you could force a beat on the first frame, making the pic effect list enabled all the time slows it down too much :( )<br />
      <br />
      :up: :up:<br />
      <br />
      Wish I could make stuff like that. :mad: :cry: :( :) :D<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      (I really am starting to use those things too much)</p>

      <p class="post-content">wow what a terrible pack. :down: :down:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      haha<br />
      <br />
      APRIL FOOLS :D<br />
      <br />
      probably the best AVS pack ever created.<br />
      <br />
      and nice renders. what do you use to create new render objects and trans effects?<br />
      <br />
      this is more than just an avs pack, its an avs upgrade, cause along with the 12 amazing presets you get 2 new renders and 2 new trans effects.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm is it because it's an executable file? In that case, try the link below... it's still an EXE though, so rename the file after downloading it (the installer installs a new font on your system, so I can't just zip the presets up :)).<br />
