<div class="posttext">Hi, I'm new here, so I hope this is the correct forum! :D<br />
<br />
anyways, after working out my equation for converting 3D coords into 2D:<br />
<br />
x=x1*z1/dst<br />
y=y1*z1/dst<br />
<br />
I am looking to implement rotation. I am working with superscopes, and have worked with winamp for quite a while, so most of the jargon you use i should be familiar with!<br />
<br />
I have d/led el-vis's 3D t'ing and looked at his .txt file to go with it. I see the xs, xc etc etc and am wondering what it all means!<br />
<br />
basically, what is this, along with the equations leading up to x,y,z4 and why are they there?<br />
(It's all very well making scopes, but i like to know how it all works, and then make one myself!)<br />
<br />
thankyou in advance, I hope I make sense!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">first of all, don't use the el-vis method of 3D.  it's slow and not very dynamic.  download avs primer :down: which has an explanation of 3D - a rough and non-precise one, but it works.  i'll be updating it soon, and it'll have a better version...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks! The AVS primer set t'ings out much better, along with other explanations<br />
BUT...<br />
It doesn't explain what:<br />
<br />
x2=x1*sin(zt)-y1*cos(zt); y2=x1*cos(zt)+y1*sin(zt);<br />
x3=x2*sin(yt)-z1*cos(yt); z2=x2*cos(yt)+z1*sin(yt);<br />
y3=y2*sin(xt)-z2*cos(xt); z3=y2*cos(xt)+z2*sin(xt);<br />
<br />
means, and this is what I want to know. also, exactly what x,y,zt mean would be useful.<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">xt, yt, and zt are variables used to rotate the 3-D object.  Those three lines are an implementation of a rotation matrix, but since AVS doesn't support matrices, the crossproduct has to be spelled out.  Basically, you can modify xt, yt, and zt to make it move.  A complete explanation of 3-D will be coming out once Atero updates his primer(which I believe will be soon).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">'Kay, i shall wait till then, then!<br />
In the mean time, I will work on non-3D presets, and may well release a pack of them for reviewing.<br />
Oh, and one question: what exactly do d and r mean in DMs?<br />
r seems to be rotation, but d...? :D<br />
anywho, thanks for help so far!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">And as I said in the primer...don't just use my code because it's there, use it knowing how it works and why.  Again, I'll be updating soon, with a better explanation of all that....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks Jaheck<br />
And don't worry Atero, I generally pick code apart before using it in anyway! (My dad conditioned me well...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">finally, a noob that dosent irritate the hell out of everyone, n1. GL with the avsing, took me ages to figure out 3d rotation. Pretty worthless post really but im exceptionally bored</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol, so's this but hey!<br />
I wouldn't consider myself a n00b, as I have worked on AVS for some time, but there we go!<br />
<br />
p.s.<br />
The link for PiMP seems to be broken, should I e-mail someone, and is there another place for me to get it?</div></div><hr />

I cannot beleive people still use Pimp :) NSIS was the follow up to Pimp and now NSIS is open source and all the info you need is here<br />

I am pretty sure that Nullsofts Pimp has been official discontinued now and has been for some time.<br />
<br />
I honestly want to reject AVS preset packs that have the old Pimp installer. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">From AVS Primer: <br />
This particular preet shows the ability to use one effect, and then<br />
effect the effected effect without effecting the effect effecting the<br />
effect. <br />
<br />
It took me 6 times to understand that, although I still don't understand it! :igor: <br />

BTW... You spelt preset wrong.;) :weird:</div></div><hr />
