      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D rotation</strong><br />
      Hi, I'm new here, so I hope this is the correct forum! :D<br />
      <br />
      anyways, after working out my equation for converting 3D coords into 2D:<br />
      <br />
      x=x1*z1/dst<br />
      y=y1*z1/dst<br />
      <br />
      I am looking to implement rotation. I am working with superscopes, and have worked with winamp for quite a while, so most of the jargon you use i should be familiar with!<br />
      <br />
      I have d/led el-vis's 3D t'ing and looked at his .txt file to go with it. I see the xs, xc etc etc and am wondering what it all means!<br />
      <br />
      basically, what is this, along with the equations leading up to x,y,z4 and why are they there?<br />
      (It's all very well making scopes, but i like to know how it all works, and then make one myself!)<br />
      <br />
      thankyou in advance, I hope I make sense!</p>

      <p class="post-content">first of all, don't use the el-vis method of 3D. it's slow and not very dynamic. download avs primer :down: which has an explanation of 3D - a rough and non-precise one, but it works. i'll be updating it soon, and it'll have a better version...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hrrrm...</strong><br />
      Thanks! The AVS primer set t'ings out much better, along with other explanations<br />
      BUT...<br />
      It doesn't explain what:<br />
      <br />
      x2=x1*sin(zt)-y1*cos(zt); y2=x1*cos(zt)+y1*sin(zt);<br />
      x3=x2*sin(yt)-z1*cos(yt); z2=x2*cos(yt)+z1*sin(yt);<br />
      y3=y2*sin(xt)-z2*cos(xt); z3=y2*cos(xt)+z2*sin(xt);<br />
      <br />
      means, and this is what I want to know. also, exactly what x,y,zt mean would be useful.<br />
      Thanks again!</p>

      <p class="post-content">xt, yt, and zt are variables used to rotate the 3-D object. Those three lines are an implementation of a rotation matrix, but since AVS doesn't support matrices, the crossproduct has to be spelled out. Basically, you can modify xt, yt, and zt to make it move. A complete explanation of 3-D will be coming out once Atero updates his primer(which I believe will be soon).</p>

      <p class="post-content">'Kay, i shall wait till then, then!<br />
      In the mean time, I will work on non-3D presets, and may well release a pack of them for reviewing.<br />
      Oh, and one question: what exactly do d and r mean in DMs?<br />
      r seems to be rotation, but d...? :D<br />
      anywho, thanks for help so far!</p>

      I am pretty sure that Nullsofts Pimp has been official discontinued now and has been for some time.<br />
      <br />
      I honestly want to reject AVS preset packs that have the old Pimp installer. :)
