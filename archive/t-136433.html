<div class="posttext">Well, I'd like to have the entire collection of avs presets that came built-in with winamp. The problem is that as newer versions of winamp/avs came out, the newer presets weren't added but replaced older ones. So it would pe painful to start downloading all winamp versions from 2.5 or whatever, install them one after other, and so on, and finally install the latest version I'm using (2.80). So would it be nice if I can get that collection from elsewhere, stand-alone, to put it into winamp path (and keep the existing/newer files with the same name). Any help ??<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Take my advice, don't watch those tired old presets. Read this article and download some of the packs off here. You won't be disappointed.<br />

<div class="posttext">I do not consider those oldies so tired. I remember there was some who came with 2.71 or something so. One was called dr. love or something similar. I liked them. Just a different opinion. However thanks for your reply.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">get an old version of winamp and install the recent version over it, you'll have your old presets then ;)<br />

edit: avs was introduced in winamp 2.61 (see whatsnew.txt), get that and a 2.7x version and you should have most presets</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok, that would be, get the versions with major avs updates and install. after finishing that i would consider adding other vis packs as recommended. but until that i have to see what i'm doing about the avs version (2.60)that came with v2.91 , it does not work with previous skins and was buggy to read some presets from 2.51 that came with winamp3, while 2.51 was able to display those new from 2.60 . I saw on another thread it was recommended to replace the 2.60 with another one 2.5.1</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Trust me, once you see other much better vis packs you will realise how inferior the newpicks are. Be enlightened, please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some of those Newpicks are intersting, Read: Duo<br />

<div class="posttext">True, newpicks are inferior to a lot of other presets, but I still like them... Duo's presets in Newpicks are more like an anomaly to me...<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I tried to recreate the classic feel a couple of times... never succeeded, of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">One person that no one ever seems to mention is the AVS Artist named Jim Manley.  If you haven't seen his pack, (he's only made one) check it out!  It's awesome!<br />
