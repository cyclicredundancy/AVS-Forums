<div class="posttext">Hi DaffodilDi. Always great to see newcomers to the wonder of AVS. :) Anyway, here's my preset review:<br />
<br />
Bubble Rings: A bit plain for my taste, but I love the SSCs. I see you've dug into EL-VIS's start guide. 3/5<br />
Butterfly Stars: Nice, but needs a bit of work. You might want to use a more commonly used font, too. 2.5/5<br />
Color Swirls: That is a fantastic piece of coding! Looked a little better with the simple on line mode. 3.5/5<br />
Drawing Hearts: This one's a bit too similiar to Butterfly Stars. 2/5<br />
ElectroBump: A bit static, but I love this one! 3.5/5<br />
Flower: For all its simplicity, this is one of the best relaxation presets I've ever seen. 3.5/5<br />
Flower2: Unfortunately this doesn't live up to its predecessor. 2.5/5<br />
Ghostly: Hmm...not that good. 1.5/5<br />
Glitter Trail: Somewhat abstract with the text, but still nice. 2.5/5<br />
Gradient Colors: Doesn't do much, but it's a great effect. 3/5<br />
Happy New Year: Looked much better with &quot;clear every frame&quot; turned off, but not by much. 1.5/5<br />
It's Gonna Be Me: The same problem as with New Year, but this is a lot better. 2/5<br />
Let's Get Loud: Awesome pseudo-colour clip effect with the simples! 3/5<br />
Love 'n' Hugs: You're lucky I've got all these fonts! Still I don't like the direction you're taking with presets like this. 1.5/5<br />
Love Swirl: This is more like it. I love the swirl! 3.5/5<br />
Make Your Mind Up: This doesn't do much either, but good nonetheless. 2.5/5<br />
RotoSwirl: Great colour effects, but a bit stoppy-starty. 3.5/5<br />
Smile: There's that evil monster again... 1.5/5<br />
Star Bounce: Another fantastic movement! One or two coding errors though. This the best so far. 3.5/5<br />
Starfield: Pretty weird. Was it meant to jerk like that? 2.5/5<br />
Stormy Night: This is a great example of how sometimes you just don't need a colour clip. 3/5<br />
Sunburster: It's so...blue! 2/5<br />
Swirlit: Pretty damn nice. 3/5<br />
Swirly: Again, this one's a bit too plain. 2/5<br />
<br />
The verdict: A few too many of your presets do almost nothing, which is never good. You definitely need to watch what fonts you use, because some of those are pretty uncommon, to the best of my knowledge. But your coding definitely makes up for this, expecially in Star Bounce, which ties with ElectroBump for my pick of the litter. Just keep at it, you're quite good!<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
Originality: :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
Overall: :) :) :) :( :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My favourite's gotta be love swirl, despite not having that font. Pretty decent for a newbie pack. It has more variety than most, and variety is the spice of life. I'm in agreement with uNDefineD when it comes to the indivdual presets. I'm not gonna take the time to do a thourough review because I have a meeting to go to (and possibly a job afterwords (fingers crossed)).<br />
<br />
Overall I kinda liked it. I'm not sure what starfield had to do with stars, but perhaps that's because I didn't have the font you used. I never really was a fan of static presets, like some of yours are,  but the ones I really liked balanced it out. (When you start coding your own dynamic things is when stuff starts to get fun)<br />
<br />
Keep it up. You can only get better. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">How do I say this... I think you're at both ends of the newbie position...<br />
<br />
You started coding - good ones - Good!<br />
...Until I noticed the only 2 SSCs in Swirlit is similiar to Justin's Superscope Love. I compared them, and what do you know. Exact match.<br />
<br />
You're using text too much - Bad...<br />
<br />
My comp have a weird tendency that if a text is set on replace, everything above it is erased (Like putting a black clear screen, then putting the text on additive rite below it). So... I have to put each text in a fx list that is set on max blend output. Texts are extremely slow. The thing I do just to see them makes them slower. Please, no text. Get along with SSC - Then you'll somehow find a way to get around texts and make a SSC with the same shape and picture - AND, you'll be able to make it move around, change colors, or even make it rotate in 3d... da possibility is endless.<br />
<br />
Otherwise... You're not coding. - Start to learn coding. Do a simple x-y movement. Do a simple rotation. Replace that blitter feedback with a movement/DM (When you're doing beat change, well, that's advanced stuff... start simple!)<br />
<br />
Well, I can't say you're close to finishing the newbie years... That pack's text presets weighed it down a lot... Without them, 3-3.5 star material. Just try to remember the completeness part =)</div></div><hr />
