<div class="posttext">This is a collection of various presets I have been working on over the past 2 years while at high school :P<br />
<br />
Comments on each preset are below along with improvments I would like to make before (maybe) publishing :D<br />
<br />
Comments and suggestions VERY welcome, and thanks for taking the time in advance!<br />
<br />
(At the moment i could not be bothered putting these comments in each file so hopefully this will do :P)<br />
<br />
<br />
2Vox - One of my very first presets, looks great with slower music as the white spectrums seem to be surrounding the Center one.<br />
<br />
Black and White Blocky Scope Ring - Quite like this one but im wanting to stop the  visulisation flowing out of the center after a period of time - probally size of the ring but i cant fix it.<br />
<br />
Bump - I like this 3D effect on the vox but i am not sure whether to leave the bump stationary or to move it as it is currently.<br />
<br />
Colour Blocky Scope Ring - Variation obviously, one of my favourites.<br />
<br />
Colour Snake - Another of my first ones, Only problem being that every so often it leaves one patch of pulsing colour when changing presets.<br />
<br />
Colours + Rotating Voxes - Quite like this one as well...<br />
<br />
Fading Spectrums - Ill probally go with the first one but im wanting the foreground spectrum to appear fully over the rest rather than slightly see through.<br />
<br />
Fuzzy Beating Vox - OK, you probally hate this one and its ver harsh but still :P<br />
<br />
Overlapping Scope - LOVE this one, when it moves and the flowing part seems to stand still... LOVE IT<br />
<br />
Proper Spectrum - In my searches i could not find a proper spectrum AVS anywhere so here we go - nice and boring but it took ages to find out how to code this, theres probally a much simpler way i missed but oh well :P<br />
<br />
Roto Swirl - Simple and Nice<br />
<br />
Spinning Rushing Colours - Yes unoriginal name. I was wanting this one to appear as though rushing through a tunel with the colours changing on a beat but still rushing out of the center. Meh didnt turn out but its still cool, however would still like more of a 3D effect on the tunneling.<br />
<br />
Static Everywhere - Confusing but looks quite cool at times. Would like to spice this one up a bit, suggestions welcome!<br />
<br />
Strange Ring - Another of my favourites, yes the colour map is messy and some ideas on improving this one would be welcome as well.<br />
<br />
The Original Spectrum - My first attempt at a true spectrum. This one is very dodgily coded but it seems to work and its a nice change :D.<br />
<br />
Water Dots - Would you belive this was my VERY FIRST preset. Loved it then loved it now. I like to think its original but u neva know eh.<br />
<br />
Wrapt - Hopefully another original, This is another of my favourites.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think there are a few very good presets.<br />
The original spectrum preset is simple but very very cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The AVS guide was also on the original link :P<br />
<br />
Thanks for the support kauahagga<br />
<br />
After reading what i could of the guide it would seem that the spectrum presets I made were just as dodgily coded as i thought :P. The whole way to draw single lines etc. is something id been looking for for quite some time, i really should use these forums more :D<br />
Ive started trying to code them again and will get back.</div></div><hr />

 I got to give it to ya, for first pack this is good, even tho' you have been working on the presets for quite a long time. Just for a hint, aesthetics is everything; if preset has good beat responsiveness but looks like crap, then the presets is crap. But don't get me wrong, beat responsiveness is very important and presets that dont respond to sound aren't exactly the best of all. <br />
  AND... don't use RGB colours (like in &quot;Water dots&quot;), people don't like it much... i learned it the hard way :p<br />
 I really like &quot;Roto swirl&quot;. Add some convolution magic and dingle around with colours and it'll be great preset.<br />
<br />
aye, mind the matt... his presets suck a lot more than yours :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">aesthetically: yes,<br />
coding: no! :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry to ressurect my age old thread :P<br />
<br />
Been trying to find stuff on how to use convolution filters properly all over the place... no sucess.<br />
I assume they work the same way as photo editing software but for each frame or something, but i don't even know how to use those properly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the positive comments Jaak btw.</div></div><hr />
