      <p class="post-content">Pretty cool... very attractive but not very responsive. Its a nice idea and pretty well implimented, my only major gripe is that the ground and sky take time to appear and, because of this, when the preset is first loaded the unicycle is magically hovering over the void. The other thing is that the wheel sometimes overlaps the landscape... not very often though. Its a nice preset though, the colours and shading are great, reminds me of a platform game.</p>

      One of the cutest presets I have ever see. The only problem I sopt with it that sometimes the angle of the unicycle increases so much that the upper part of the cycle dashes with the terrain.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If I ever get around to learning particle engines, I have a pretty good idea on how to make a good mario preset, but until then I'm stuck using texer to make an odd looking pixelated plumber.

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, my mario was going to use a number of texer images, corresponding with a numberr of single dot scopes. Eg, one for mario walking left, right, jumping, dieing.<br />

      For the terrain i was probably going to use more complicated shifting thing... like this one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was meaning fake ones, just use tons of synchonized superscope particles dots to make general shapes/colors then use a nifty convoloution filter trick to make everything smooth out, it will hopefully end up looking something like the super mario brothers that came out for the original nintendo. I also am working on making a nintendo64 paper mario type one, but I am having trouble making the pictures look right in the avs... stupid aspect ratio</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm... why not construct mario from superscopes using w and h to make him pixel perfect if required... the end result will be immensely fast (fps) compared to these texer nightmares you are currently concocting, besides how would you switch texer images? An alpha DM?<br />
      <br />
      There is a really easy way to make a particle system in avs: simply use loads of single point superscopes. Anything global to the system (for example: a global velocity for wind direction) can be synchronously calculated in every scope.</p>
