<div class="posttext">I'm sure there is a better place for this but I'm in San Diego which is going up in smoke and I am getting tired with my now dry scrachy throat so I didn't look very far past searching for AVS help i the forums......put it wherever it should be, I am sorry for any inconvinience(sp?).<br />
<br />
I've never published presets b4, and decided to see how people (unofficially) liked them.....please download my pack (if the download works) and take a look.  It should be the attached file, and is compressed.<br />
<br />
      Special thanks to Steven Wittens for    allowing me to modify and use one of his Superscopes, and also for teaching me how to use one (although not very well) through the help with superscopes forum.     <br />
My color coding in the superscopes comes from that thread as well .<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">OK if that didnt work correctly you have to use winzip to extract the files in order to use them; i would have said this above but was unable to fix it without contacting th admin.......<br />

<div class="posttext">Some stuff you got there aint bad. A few I even liked, though overall I'd say it looks a bit n00bish. But hey, that's ok for a first pack :). So stick around, search the forums, download Atero's primer (important one, that), and keep practising. Learn some coding, and soon you'll be able to make some really original presets as well :).<br />
