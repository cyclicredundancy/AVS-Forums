Thank you very much. :)<br />

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I don't think I'm familiar with the /nocheck switch.<br />
<br />
At any rate as soon as I open the executable a box pops up titled: Missing AVS Plugin. It says, &quot;Setup could not detect VIS_AVS.DLL in your Winamp directory. Do you want to download it now or continue installation? I clicked to ignore this message where it asks for my destination folder. It's already set at E:\Winamp\, which doesn't make much sense as that is a DVD/CD-ROM drive.<br />
<br />
Anyway I browsed to select C:\Program Files\Winamp\ and clicked next. At the next screen I chose not to install the plugins and then clicked install. <a href="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/8249/raz3nf1.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is what I saw.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the problem was, I haven't had any other problems before installing packs made with Pimpbot.

Disabling the text-containing effect list makes it kinda work though.<br />
No output blending option works.
