does anyone have it reacting well<br />
Had you searched, you should have realized that AVS beat detection is crap, and writing a really good beat detection algorithm is really difficult.  <br />
<br />
I find it difficult to believe that you really did search these forums - I only pulled some of the threads I saw on AVS beat detection.  It has long been a problem and has been discussed many times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I guess the only real proof that nobody has it working well is that everybody has it working badly(except maybe UCD who may have edited the hex for AVS to fix the beat detection:p ).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think that is perhaps even beyond UCD to fix.... YOU HEAR THAT NULLSOFT!!!! <br />
<br />
Meh... its no use, they seem to have selective deafness when it comes to statements about AVS.</div></div><hr />
