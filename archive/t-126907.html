<div class="posttext">I'm creating an AVS preset with a custom font text effect. I'm wondering if it is possible to put a font file within the AVS presets folder (similar to how bitmaps are placed there) and still have it work. Because I want to give my preset to friends (and anyone who would want it once I unveil it) but I would rather find a way where people wouldn't have to install a font just to see the text effect correctly.<br />
<br />
I can't use a bitmap with the text because I'm making use of the Blend 50/50 filter and need the transparency effect. Some portions of the text are supposed to look like &quot;cut outs&quot; to show the effects underneath 100% while the rest has to be semi-transparent to show the other preset effects underneath at 50%. Or maybe I can use a bitmap, but I'm too dumb to figure it out. I do want to avoid the pixelation that occurs when people run the vis fullscreen, which is why I'm going with a font that has a predetermined size.<br />
<br />
If Winamp accepted animated GIFs, my problem would be easily solved. Right now it's just an issue of finding a way to show my text effect without the hassle of people needing to install a font.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">several ways to solve your problem.  One(and the best method) is to make a NSIS installer program that will install the custom fonts as well as the presets(search the NSIS forums for more help).  Two is to create a bmp of the text you want to display and use that instead.  Three is to create an avi file using AVSgrabber or the like - if you want animated text.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the installer for tff2.0 (source included) installs fonts for windows 95/98/nt/2k/me without restart and xp with restart (i think, don't quote me on it tho), as well as apes/avs files for winamp 2.x or 3 with a 1337 control system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the code works fairly well, there is a small bug with the one menu, so i remodeled it slightly for my own needs.  i also included the option of installing avs 2.5.1 with the installer so nobody will have stupid problems with not having the latest version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">umm...you SURE that 2.5.1 isn't wa3-only and 2.5 is wa2-only?  i can't see any other differences in the model itself...you might want to fix that (&lt;edit&gt; IF it's a problem, that is ;) &lt;/edit&gt;)<br />
<br />
and i really want to know how you &quot;remodeled&quot; it to fit your needs - it took me about two weeks to work that all out because of the crappy psuedo-logic i had to use.  and what's the bug you're talking about?  i know of one that i haven't gotten around to fixing (i will by tff3.0) that the APE window wont turn off by the parent tree (only by the &quot;for winamp 2.x&quot;, &quot;for winamp 3.x&quot; windows)...is that the one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So you need the text to be animated? If not you could use UnConeD's APE: Picture Render II which is a much better picture rendering tool for avs and allows bilinear filtering to the picture (no jagged edges or pixelation no matter what resolution)<br />
<br />
Get the Picture Render II from this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=118025) <br />
<br />
Otherwise, just make sure your friends install the font before viewing your preset :) But if it's not a free font then comes all the nasty copyright&amp;law stuff you have to worry about...</div></div><hr />
