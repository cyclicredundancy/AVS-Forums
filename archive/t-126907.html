      <p class="post-content"><strong>Question about fonts...</strong><br />
      I'm creating an AVS preset with a custom font text effect. I'm wondering if it is possible to put a font file within the AVS presets folder (similar to how bitmaps are placed there) and still have it work. Because I want to give my preset to friends (and anyone who would want it once I unveil it) but I would rather find a way where people wouldn't have to install a font just to see the text effect correctly.<br />
      <br />
      I can't use a bitmap with the text because I'm making use of the Blend 50/50 filter and need the transparency effect. Some portions of the text are supposed to look like "cut outs" to show the effects underneath 100% while the rest has to be semi-transparent to show the other preset effects underneath at 50%. Or maybe I can use a bitmap, but I'm too dumb to figure it out. I do want to avoid the pixelation that occurs when people run the vis fullscreen, which is why I'm going with a font that has a predetermined size.<br />
      <br />
      If Winamp accepted animated GIFs, my problem would be easily solved. Right now it's just an issue of finding a way to show my text effect without the hassle of people needing to install a font.</p>

      <p class="post-content">several ways to solve your problem. One(and the best method) is to make a NSIS installer program that will install the custom fonts as well as the presets(search the NSIS forums for more help). Two is to create a bmp of the text you want to display and use that instead. Three is to create an avi file using AVSgrabber or the like - if you want animated text.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the installer for tff2.0 (source included) installs fonts for windows 95/98/nt/2k/me without restart and xp with restart (i think, don't quote me on it tho), as well as apes/avs files for winamp 2.x or 3 with a 1337 control system.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the code works fairly well, there is a small bug with the one menu, so i remodeled it slightly for my own needs. i also included the option of installing avs 2.5.1 with the installer so nobody will have stupid problems with not having the latest version.</p>

      <p class="post-content">umm...you SURE that 2.5.1 isn't wa3-only and 2.5 is wa2-only? i can't see any other differences in the model itself...you might want to fix that (&lt;edit&gt; IF it's a problem, that is ;) &lt;/edit&gt;)<br />
      <br />
      and i really want to know how you "remodeled" it to fit your needs - it took me about two weeks to work that all out because of the crappy psuedo-logic i had to use. and what's the bug you're talking about? i know of one that i haven't gotten around to fixing (i will by tff3.0) that the APE window wont turn off by the parent tree (only by the "for winamp 2.x", "for winamp 3.x" windows)...is that the one?</p>

      <p class="post-content">So you need the text to be animated? If <b>not</b> you could use UnConeD's APE: Picture Render II which is a much better picture rendering tool for avs and allows bilinear filtering to the picture (no jagged edges or pixelation no matter what resolution)<br />
      <br />
      Get the Picture Render II from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=118025" target="_blank">this thread</a><br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, just make sure your friends install the font before viewing your preset :) But if it's not a free font then comes all the nasty copyright&amp;law stuff you have to worry about...</p>
