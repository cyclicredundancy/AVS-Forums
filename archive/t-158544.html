<div class="posttext">OK this version should resolve the loading preset bugs, finally. Hopefully. Also added some new superscope capabilities, including 'skip', 'linesize', and 'drawmode' (chooses points or lines).<br />

<div class="posttext">100 is pretty big... just make sure your n is set low enough, and then it should be a big fat line.. if you do hundreds of points, you'll have a lot of 1 pixel by 100 pixel line stripes =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, i was thinking of line width dependent triangel rendering ssc if i read 'linesize' :D, but oh well... skip is very cool ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
and again i must say... no arrays... no vectors... very cool things could be done with arrays, vectors would make coding much more easyer and many ssc/dm codes much more shorter. But I understand, you got work to do with winamp 5.<br />

i cant say anything about loading preset bug, this bug hasnt occured to me in previous versions, i just hope its fixed :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is one hell of a bug:<br />
<br />
1) Go fullscreen<br />
2) Click left mouse button<br />
3) When the cursor goes under Winamp/AVS/config window, click in the lower left corner of the config window - well under the config window - where the docking window used to be.<br />
AVS docks, but the main AVS window stays where it is and stops updating the portion of the screen under the AVS window (except for the frame).<br />
&lt;edit&gt; The AVS window also gives you the Winamp main window popup menu when you right click after you do this.<br />

<div class="posttext">er... magicX, what do you mean by AA? <br />
<br />
The superscope works in more detail than pixels anyway, so why would you need it?<br />
<br />
If a scope looks pixelised, then you need to work in a bigger desktop resolution (or avs fullscreen one), there is no other way around it.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you meant antialiasing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes i am ;) i talked about this with UCD in another thread, right now, i don't remeber where.<br />
<br />
But basically it should be able to smooth a line along its vectorial direction (eg vector from point 98 of 800 to point 99 of 800).<br />
<br />
You could smooth it by bilinear filtering for example.</div></div><hr />

OK so would an implementation like:<br />
<br />
<br />
bla=arrayalloc(size);<br />
arraysetitem(bla,index,value);<br />
poo=arraygetitem(bla,index);<br />
arrayfree(bla);<br />
<br />
be adequate?<br />
<br />
obviously size, index, and the array pointer itself would still be floating point values, but be rounded to int as necessary to make sense...<br />
<br />
I can do this fairly easily. Would that meet the needs? If not, what else would be needed?<br />

<div class="posttext">Sounds good to me, although more &quot;traditional&quot; subscripting (bla[index]=value) would be nicer, though (if feasable), although I think it wouldn't add too much as long as the array was dimensioned right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That seems terribly convoluted, and I'd rather you didn't put effort into that because eventually I'm betting it'll get changed, and you'd have to leave it in the evallib for old presets (if you didn't, that would be bad.)  Personally I'd prefer that you tried to fuddle with the evallib so you could do different things with the lefthand side of an assignment, e.g. the traditional<br />
array[sizex][sizey]...; // array allocation consists of no assignments<br />
array[x][y]=borgle;<br />
You could then do things like user globals: <br />
$global;<br />
$global=bangle;<br />
Overloading globals ($global != global) would be nice too ;)<br />
But in terms of the arrays, I'd like to see the following syntax:<br />
<br />
array[sizex][sizey]...; // allocates array of size sizexXsizeyXsizez...<br />
array[5][3]=bloor; // assigns value bloor to index 5,3<br />
array [2]=blargh; // assigns value blargh to all indices in y=2<br />
array =skaggle; // assigns value skaggle to all indices<br />
array=warts; // variable &quot;array&quot; is different from array &quot;array&quot;<br />
<br />
probably asking for too much here...but it'd be really, really, really nice :D with the code you suggested there's no way to do multidimensional arrays with any ease as far as i can tell.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK well here is my thinking:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Making the arrays accessed via a function rather than a new language syntax is a lot easier (I know this ultimately doesnt matter that much to everybody else, but it changes it from a quicky day project to a much larger project that could potentially break a lot of other shit)<br />
 Global variables that have names may be possible, but create a whole host of memory management issues -- i.e. if every preset creates its own global variables, they stay around forever? Garbage collection? See below.<br />
 Arrays are a lot easier to keep local (not global) for the above reason.<br />
 Otherwise, we'd have to do some sophisticated garbage collection-type things. Which takes time to implement, and lots of testing before we could really be serious about putting this in the main distribution.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yes, we could go completely overhaul shit. But ultimately that'll just mean that it'll take tons of time and break shit and be a big pain in the ass. :/ I don't know what the best thing to do is...<br />

I'm not sure how the evallib handles assignment and variable-address retrieval, but maybe if you could code it like this:<br />
<br />
arraygetitem(array, 5) = foo;<br />
bar = arraygetitem(array, 5);<br />
<br />
Then you could put a pre-processor step in to convert from array[5] into that. That would rock ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why I don't know if array's should be worried about now.  I think eventually it would be best to wait until it is a bit easier to do the full version and when there is a bit more time to do it.  I don't ever really like languages that take the function approach to arrays and such.  It is much more of a hassle to first have to use the functions, and then when you find time and switch it over - the old functions will still have to be included in new versions.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no, arrays are a very good idea, and would be extremely usefull. They would certainly allow us to do many things that we have been otherwise putting off. Such as propper tentacle effects, and speeding up older presets by making more complicated things into single scopes.<br />
<br />
I dont think they would scare off the new comers, as they dont need to know about them if they dont understand it. <br />
<br />
But still, i think its vital that the released version of 2.8 is just as stable as 2.6 is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:down:<br />
I have a ton of things I could use arrays for, and I'm sure that most of the other advanced programmers here do to.  It's not something I'd want to stall the release of WA5 over, but I would *REALLY* like to see some proper array management.<br />
I'll be blunt - that arrayalloc() shit sucks major ass.  Like I said before, if that gets implemented, people will start using that and then there'll be no way to change it.  I know it'd be a lot of major work, and I appreciate that - you're only human (well, to us you're an uberhuman) - but I think trying to use a bad form of array management would be a really bad idea.<br />
As for garbage collection, why not create an internal list of every $global created, and then when a preset is turned off, delete all $globals in that list?  Or, when the preset is turned off, look through all the variables and delete all the ones that start with $ (or whatever other marking they'll get)?<br />
Another thing I'd still like to see is a user-expandable varlib.  I don't know if this is possible, and if it's not I'd like to see it expanded again, especially if we're gonna be using arrays.  (I'm going to assume for now that array[5][5] will take up 25 variable slots, correct me if I'm wrong).<br />

Global variables are almost ok, they'll be perfect if they could be accessed like this:<br />
reg( variable ) = value;  // set value<br />
and blahblah = reg( variable );  // read value<br />
Or, if you'd like to continue using function only on the right side of equation, use this for setting value:<br />
value = reg( variable );  // almost same thing<br />
It's like eval(&quot;reg&quot;+number+&quot;=blahblah&quot;); stuff in other languages ;)<br />
And to access arrays with standard syntax ( array[ level1 ][ level2 ] ) will be hard (impossabile?) to program in just a few days, I understand.<br />
I thing one 1-dimentional array will be enough for the first time.<br />
<br />
P.S. maybe you don't want to do major stuff with AVS because it's free and doesn't do any good for you - maybe you should make a donation stuff, I'll give you 50$ or more if you do :)</div></div><hr />

For the second part... don't be lazy.<br />
1-D array... It *can* be made into a 2D with a little improvisation I guess.</div></div><hr />

When you take the sign of a global variable, it is always 1 or -1, never 0.</div></div><hr />

I'd say no arrays for now. They'd only be really useful with proper looping control structures (though you could always use a skip=1 superscope as a for loop ;) ).  <br />
<br />
My fear of adding loop capability would be what if a preset does an infinite loop? :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Now that someone mentioned it.  I think loops might be much more useful than arrays.  As for the infinite loop problem you have two choices, you could trust people not to send presets into an infinite loop.  Or do what gaekwad2 said.  I think the first would be better.  <br />
<br />
Maybe a harder but overall better solution would be to put in some kind of feature that allows presets made by other people to use loops.  But doesn't allow n00bs to use loops unless a checkbox in the display options is checked.  That way n00bs who don't need loops simply can't use them unless the checkbox is on.  Which would prevent idiots from accidentally sending there presets into infinite loops.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In Macromedia Flash, if a loop goes for too long (I think about 10 seconds) a popup comes up asking if you would like to abort the script. This happens every ten seconds if you select not to abort but the script is still looping. Perhaps this can be implemented in AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OK I'll think about loops and arrays, and we'll do it later (post wa5.0).<br />
Here is avs 2.8b2, which mainly just fixes the sscope skip bug in b1.<br />
<br />
http://www.firehose.net/~deadbeef/avs28b2.zip<br />
<br />
Ideally this will be the ver in wa5.0 that launches, well, any day now...<br />

<div class="posttext">I think arrays will be more useful than loops. I mean, loops are great, but priority of arrays is above loops.<br />
Arrays will enable particle engines, complex random-scopes, complex flows etc. What major improvements can loops make? And - preset is recompiled at any change, every time you check a checkbox or type a symbol. Imagine that you're typing code and you didn't finish it and it's already compiled - and does infinite loop. Imagine how much harder it is to build loops (with standart syntax I mean) than arrays? I'm voting for arrays first!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'd say they are the same priority.  A lot of things that you would want to do with arrays can't be done til loops are implemented.  <br />
<br />
I have a feeling they will both be added at the same time to AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yuh, arrays are nuffin without loops...<br />
<br />
but thing i vote for is less buggier avs, this is above everything :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th December 2003, 06:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">arrrays aren't nothing without loops - they are just a bit less.  You can still use arrays to draw a cube or something much easier - just use array[curr_pixel] to get the predefined vertice for the 3D figure.<br />
<br />
For example: square<br />
INIT:<br />
n=6;vertices[6][2]={{-1,-1},{-1,1},{1,1},{1,-1}};<br />
FRAME:<br />
q=0;<br />
PIXEL:<br />
x=vertices[q][0];y=vertices[q][1];<br />
q=q+1;<br />
<br />
Then it would be really cool if matrix/array math was added.  3D rotation and just about everything would be a bit easier, although possibly not faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">IMO, it's more important to get avs stable and to do some &quot;small&quot; improvementsto avs right now like multiline text and maybe some others to have a proper release ready for WA5.<br />
<br />
There's been so much progress that it might take me a few months to work all the stuff out i could do with those new features.<br />
<br />
I agree that arrays, looping and a better assignment structure are valueable but for now they're not nessecary.<br />
<br />
People have been messing around with avs for about 2 years without any changes, tweaking it to the max of its possibillities.<br />
<br />
Now, there's a flood of new stuff and peopel keep on asking for more although it's been barely used yet.<br />
<br />
Let's leave this stuff for coming up releases. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's a good idea anubis, didn't think of that.  which is funny cos i've wished for it in cpp for a long time :p<br />
<br />
(of course if it's there i'd never know about it cos i'm a n00b cpper)<br />
<br />
<br />
btw justin, it's really not that hard to make avs crash (or at least lock up).  i've done it several times before.  i can never repeat it, but it's entirely possible.  all you really have to do is make it do a TON of slow operations all at once.  you might even be able to do something like:<br />
init: n=pow(w*h,2)<br />
point: n=n+1;p=p+1;x=p*n*pow(-1,p)*cos(p);y=p*n*pow(-1,p)*sin(p);red=p/0;<br />
<br />
at some point i'll make a special &quot;fuck you&quot; preset that just crashes avs just for you justin ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have a question.  Is there a posability that fullscreen on a second monitor feature could be added to the AVS. You can see my specs. I noticed that in the modern skin If I click the full screen button in the video window it goes full screen on whatever monitor the window occupies. <br />
<br />
I hope that made sense.  I'd like to see that same feature added to the AVS if possible.<br />
<br />
Also I am aware that milkdrop is supposed to do that. But I cant get it to work.</div></div><hr />
