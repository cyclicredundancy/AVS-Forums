			<strong>some ideas</strong><br />
		
		

		Even though your AVSs were a bit simple, I was surprised that you made them quite pleasant. Though, I find that pixels don't always look great.<br />
<br />
 For example, I found that adding a water affect after the effect group in #16 gave it a smooth and interesting look. Adding a blur or similar effect after the list helps with smoothing.<br />
<br />
 #19 and 22 need work.<br />
<br />
 There is somethings you can do with your scopes that you may find useful. It is that you can control the colors on a per-point basis. (Note: the colors variables (blue,green,red) range from 0 to 1, which is the same as the range 0 to 255 in the color selection window)<br />
<br />
 For example, in #22, add &quot;blue=blue+v&quot; [don't forget the ;s] into the point box of the first scope. It looks like you know what v is, so I won't bother explaining, but that will add or subtract blue(depending on v) from the yellow that you chose. That will make the yellow vary at each point from white to perfect yellow. You can also use variables such as i or b or sin(t).<br />
<br />
 Don't stop now...
