      <p class="post-content"><strong>Use an AVS in other application?</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I'm completely new to the subject visualisations and their possibilities, but is it possible to use a Winamp AVS as a movie in other applications, such as Flash MX of Frontpage? Any answer is appreciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">first open AVS + the editor with the preset you want to capture<br />
      <br />
      1) best place to add the APE is at the bottom of the list I don't know for sure if that's needed, just do it to be certain. ([+]&gt;misc&gt;AVSgrabber 2.0 alpha, drag to bottom)<br />
      2)select the outputfile. click [browse...] to select a folder and name your file. .avi is added automatically after your filename<br />
      3)select the playback rate (framerate). best is to leave both checkboxes on unless you want to do something else with your file.<br />
      4)select output format. select uncommpressed video or a codec from the list by clicking [choose...].<br />
      5)the .dll file is only for capturing music as well. for a website, this can be quite annoying. I personally didn't install the out_grab, but if you want to you can select it in the winamp preferences&gt;plugins&gt;output.<br />
      6)if you're done, hit [Grab!] to start grabbing frames and hit the same button to stop. the counter displays the frames captured</p>

      out_grab.dll goes in *\winamp\plugins\<br />
