		I know that there is going to be a new auto-start feature, but I think there are some others that should be put on there.  An alpha setting for the fullscreen avs would be nice. Also, the ability to use all the applications under the fullscreen without closing it or moving it to the back, but leaving the mouse pointer on top of it.  An F-key bind to turning on and off visualization would be nice, as well.<br />

		alpha setting for fullscreen was already discussed- search the forums before you post<br />
<br />
AVS at fullscreen runs too slow to be used well, especially with other apps running at the same time.  The closest you can get to this is to enable overlay mode and check the box changing your desktop  to the overlay color.<br />
<br />
PLEASE search the forums, read the FAQ, and tips and tricks before you post, otherwise you'll get all of us regulars mad at you.

		Well, my vid card/computer has bigger balls than a clydesdale, so I can run avs, burn a cd, run several instances of Phoenix Browser, my AIM client, Kazaa Lite, and warcraft 3 running in a window all at the same time with fairly little lag, and no audio skips.  This thing handles it like a champion, so I still wouldn't mind a fullscreen alpha.  By the way, I R s00per winAmp n00bz0r, so could you plz tell me how to enable overlay mode ?

		Avs dosen't get FPS through your video card, it's through your cpu. To get overlay dock avs in config, click on the settings tab and go to display. Then simply check the overlay box, make sure your background is the same as the overlay colour though.

		Thx so much for removing my ignorance.  One more suggestion for AVS, though, and that would be to have an option where it went into fullscreen mode as your screensaver.

		That has been brought up before.  Search the forums.  This is impractical because of the horrible performance AVS gets at fullscreen, unless the resolution is brought down tremendously and pixel doubling is turned on.<br />
<br />
If you want a music-reactive screensaver, download Geiss.
