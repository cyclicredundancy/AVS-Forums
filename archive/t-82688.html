      Why not Nullsoft create a seperate program, such as MilkDrop, where you could incorporate your AVS presets and it would run just as smooth. For performing musicians like myself (who always give credit to Nullsoft), who uses visualization live, this would be a god send.<br />
      If there are any programs such as this already in existance, someone plese tell me where I can get it! If anyone knows what it would take to do this, tell me and I may be able to program it myself if it is too hard. I'm sure I'm not the only one who desires something like this e.g. Acidheads :up:, Potsmokers :up:, etc. Any help on this topic would be eternally helpful.<br />

      <p class="post-content">What do you mean with 'separate program'? Milkdrop is no more a separate program than AVS is: they're both Winamp visualisation plug-ins. If you're disappointed about the speed of AVS, do a search on these forums and find one of the many threads that asked the same question.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>oh yeah... well :P</strong><br />
      I already made the suggestion... an I know this is an older probably concidered dead thread..<br />
      <br />
      also not to sound like an ass.. but if there are that many complaints or questions about speed, why isn't one of them listed in the FAQ as of yet? The FAQ I just checked talks about the math, the "settings" but it doesn't say.. "this is a list of common speed enhancements" or the like...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway... I'm off not to search for those lovely speed questions so lovingly mentioned...<br />

      <p class="post-content">The reason it's not listed in the FAQ is because the guy who maintains it (me) is not sitting at his PC 24/7. :P Will update it.</p>
