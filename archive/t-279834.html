<div class="posttext">here is the thread where I will put my presets learn how to package them into groups and advance in the advanced avs perset worlds<br />
<br />
these will be my stream of light river pipe presets<br />
<br />
Background - I have been making and remixing these presets for a while and recording them to dvd with my music I thought rather then hang at the music forum I would release a few of my presets over time...<br />
<br />
peace <br />

<div class="posttext">These are far from perfect. This may just be me, but presets that flash colors at a high framerate are just annoying and give me a head ache. But I did like robert1, it looked kind of like backlit plant cells. One of my favorite artist is FramesOfReality, whom is an exceptional abstract artist, you should check him out. Most of your presets lok like they were put together in a couple of minutes are just a jumble of color. If you do like your current &quot;style&quot; try to slow down your flashyness to on beat transitions. Good try and good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thank you for the comment I have studied FramesOfReality work from time to time when he does a release on DA.  I actually went thru about twenty of his works critically and gave him feed back about each one in a reply on DA <br />
<br />
my DA id is xoet...  but these are the years of transition and I am becoming h92o coded as Ice nine.<br />
<br />
The problem with the flashy stuff might be that I did not have enough attachment space to upload the image that goes with the presets...  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">a suggested move would be to use .bmp files and then compress both the image and avs with winrar not winzip because winrar has better text and image compression ratios.</div></div><hr />

a suggested move would be to use .bmp files and then compress both the image and avs with winrar not winzip because winrar has better text and image compression ratios. <br />
which might play a role in compressing 100MB and up, but not in avs with filesizes from 1 to a few hundred KB to compress. <br />
h92o, it doesn't matter, really which archive you use...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1. use only required color-depth (32-bit is overkill, 8-bit should be alright for most color images) for bitmaps and enable rle-compression when saving bitmaps<br />
2. i suggest .7z for compression, it's open-source, supported by many modern archivers and gives even better compression ratio than proprietary winrar<br />
3. if still to big you can upload your files to yousendit.com, sendspace.com and the many others available</div></div><hr />
