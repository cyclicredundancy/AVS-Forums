			<strong>Simple Play list..?</strong><br />
		
		

		I assembled some presets into several..Play list.. this isn't a release of any kind.. or any real remix.. just sort of gathering of presets...that I enjoy..You should be fine as long as you have 2.81d.. and all the remaining resources should already be installed for most, Like I said is mostly just a play list of sorts, with AVS files( which is awesome you guys thanks )<br />
Folders:<br />
Names relative to connections in my head , to the representation..<br />
<br />
6MOD7 - 60's Mod spanning to 70's<br />
7MOD8 - 70's Mod spanning to 80's<br />
8MOD9 - 80's Mod spanning to 90's<br />
BIT - Lower bit level graphics<br />
BWC - Black White Color<br />
Div/POS-NEG - Personal Favs<br />
Flow - self explanatory<br />
GSR - or as I would like to call it 9MOD0 - 90's - 00's<br />
Inner - I dunno.. it fits<br />
Min - Minimal but 3D kind of fits a scene<br />
Soft - Girl Party.. uhm.. or something like that<br />
Tech - was a start ... has some good ones.. would like to expand, but its in there<br />
TV - You know that Old analog TV that sitting there in the homeless camp..viewing Marilyn Manson videos.. with radioactive interference.. yeah that one..( always sitting sideways..<br />
<br />
So I also have a folder of other presets that I pulled out.. but did not include it..<br />
<br />
I thought that maybe as a general topic other AVS'ers or just people who like presets.. had a view about the structure or maybe what could be done to improve it..<br />
<br />
When you unzip I would make a folder first because I packaged it inside of the main folder..<br />

		although still too big to be attached, 7z compresses the same package down to 291kb - which is why lzma is the compressor of choice in PimpBot :p<br />
<br />
apart from that i feel pretty overrepresented in the tv selection, considering i did not own such a thing in 10 years :)
