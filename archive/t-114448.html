			<strong>Tomb Raider Visualization</strong><br />
		
		

		Well, I wasn't exactly sure where to post this, but here goes<br />
<br />
When I saw tombraider last year, I remember thinking that I wanted an lcd to display the visualizations that Laura's brother had on his setup in the trailer.  Here's what I'm talking about<b></b>:<br />
<a href="http://home.rochester.rr.com/proneax/imgs/tombraider.jpg" target="_blank">http://home.rochester.rr.com/proneax...tombraider.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If anyone knows if they used a program that's already made, or if it's a hardware output of the mixer they're using there?? or if you know what any of those visualizations are called, equations for them, anything, please post it.  It would me really cool if someone could recreate those screens. <br />
<br />
Thanks

		Left Screen top : Simple spectrum (Use getspec or spectrum option).<br />
Left Screen Bottom : Same thing.<br />
Right screen top : I'm not sure, but :<br />
 Take 2 3D SSCs, each of them displaying a line going across, and repeats again. The crossover line should be colorcoded out, and the line should be detailed (Points along them). Make them perpendicular. On z1, I think (abs(sin(x1*n))+abs([sin or cos](y1*n)))*0.5 should do something close... N is the number that tells how many waves can be seen (Though not &quot;n=1 so 1 wave&quot;). Adjust the camera to look at &quot;ground level&quot; (0 in z1 is middle of screen), make it static. Warning : This *will* be very slow.<br />
Right screen bottom : Random dots?<br />
<br />
The only information I have is that picture, so they may be inaccurate, and I still have to know what the bottom right thingy is supposed to be.

		Since its from a film it probably isn't even a real visualisation, more likely some premade animation which was then displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
The key point is that with enough knowledge and computer power you can make (almost) any visualisation with AVS. Something like those screens should be possible (and quite easy by the look of it). The fluff and background for the visualisations could be added too using all kind of scopes and effects.

		Thanks a lot guys, Nic01, I'm pretty new to AVS, I'm not sure where to plug that formula in, or how to make these two different superscopes.<br />
<br />

The top right one looks like an exploded shere, it starts out looking like a solid 'dot fountain' and then it unfolds into those &quot;triangular&quot; sections  as they move out from the center and fall away at the edges, at which point a new one comes up in the middle, pulling up the bottom edges of the triangular sections as if the whole thing is a cloth, with the edges turned up and somone pushing something up into the middle.  In the picture, it's at the final stage of the 'animation' if you will, and you can't yet see the new one coming up in the middle.  If you have the movie, its exactly at 26 minutes.<br />
<br />
As far as the dots, they appear to form a roughly cylindrical (sp) shape and rotate around a central axis with the top of the cylindar rotating toward the viewer.

		Take the time to learn the code, and the maths involved to make the vis', then implement them in AVS.  Besides that, the 'piped' vis' in movies aren't that great anyhow....

		Well i haven't watched the movie and the pictures are kinda crappy. But in my opinion if you try to implant that idea into avs i think you will be disapointed, because avs rendering quality isn't so high and it might look more &quot;juicier&quot; in the movie than in avs.<br />
<br />
So if you don't know much about superscope coding (or about avs) then it is really a lot of trouble for nothing if you decide to make it yourself and learn avs from scratch.<br />
<br />
Just a thought...
