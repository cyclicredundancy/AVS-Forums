<div class="posttext">HI all, I was sitting here staring into my computer screen, well into one of the 100's of avs presets I have downloaded, and I got to thinking (yes it hurts somtimes but I try) &quot;OMG these presets are F**king AMAZING!&quot;  <br />
<br />
I have SOOO many that I can possible review them all. So Here I am saying:<br />
<br />
To all the AVS gods(too many to name them all) THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to code the beautiful things for us to look at, thank you for helping good avs presets comming, thank you for entertaing, visually, those of us who hae nothing better to than sit infront of a computer and listen to the endless supply of music out there.<br />
<br />
I have tried to make avs presets, but I lack the time and practice, not to mention the grasp of math required to make some of these wonderful presets.<br />
<br />
I also thank the guys at Nullsoft for writing the avs studio(I can imagine what a challange it could have been)<br />
<br />
In short, thanx guys, you make my spare time more fun.<br />
<br />
:up: :up: :up: :up: :up: :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">BTW Tuggummi, your avs presets are THE most viewed on my pc... I hope that one day I can do some justice to your work withsome remixes.  With your permission of course.<br />
<br />
Tuggummi, could perhaps email me a list of the avs packs you have put out. I wanna make sure I have them all.  <br />
<br />
I'm a big fan</div></div><hr />

my favorites of UCDs are III, IV, V, VI<br />
my favorites of Jheriko's are 6, 7, 8, 9<br />
<br />
Those are my 3 favorite artists.  I have other favorite packs(both of zamuz's, Desibel+, El-VIS VR, Pickin Dim 3, most of paranoya's stuff), but those are the greatest artists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hm, favorite artists? in no particular order it's gotta be nemoorange (http://nemoorange.deviantart.com), skupers (http://skupers.deviantart.com) and tuggummi (http://tuggummi.deviantart.com). but of course i like the work of a lot of other people aswell. once again i need to mention pishiru (http://pishiru.deviantart.com), who has probably been overlooked by some people.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I figuered... I starting my first year in a Computer Information Systems Bachlors degree... So I can understand that what you do is kind of a thankless job<br />
<br />
<br />
thanx tugg, I already had most of em... I just missed 4-8 so now I have them all.<br />
<br />
Hey all u other avs gods out there, advertise your presets here.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">As I said, I'm not a god, but if you still like some simpler packs, here is my second pack. :) I hope you like it. Please let me know what you think of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tug : I have all your packs before viewing that list. Am I a nerd?<br />
<br />
Anyways : There's still a lot to be seen. Really. A shitload. You'll prolly pay tribute again when things progress more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">S-uper_T-oast</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th September 2003, 03:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I like to think of my self as a God, but reality always puts an end to that idea. I suggest you look up Pickin Dim 3 by fsk, don't know were you could find it, but it has some of the greatest 3D scoping i have ever seen. Another good one is piR, his presets are only on his website from what I know, and since I don't have the address readily availabe... He does have some really nice looking things. Lastly, I'd like to mention Scopeguru who releases one pack I know of, it has some of the best 3D synchronized scopes EVER, I'm talking about things like a couple hundred scopes to make a piano that has keys that move &quot;correctly&quot; with the getspec signal. I love AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tug : I have all your packs before viewing that list. Am I a nerd?<br />
<br />
You being nerd definetly doesn't depend on you having all of my packs :p<br />
I guess you're just bored &amp; got too much freetime in your hands :D Tho i don't whine if even my older stuff is wanted :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">HEY, I am a NERD... What of it... Nerds are cool too... Maybe only to other nerds :D ... Perhaps you should go and rent &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;  I think there are like 3 of them<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I almost understand how UnConeD and Jheriko solved their Quartics, does that make me a god? Unfortunatly not, all it got me was some major headaches and a lot of unfinshed homework in school. :)</div></div><hr />

So many ideas... so little capabilities...<br />
<br />
And Super-Toast, it's just Whittaker's method - They used numerical solving method, therefore you can only get so close to the actual thing without slowing down too much.<br />
Fortunately, we can get close enough to make it look good :)</div></div><hr />
