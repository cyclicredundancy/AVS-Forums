      <p class="post-content"><strong>Define AVS</strong><br />
      While I've been fiddling with AVS since about November of 2003, I still can't really define AVS in a few short sentences. Reason I'm asking, I've applied for a job at a graphics art firm. Right, wrong, or otherwise, I put down on my application under the Other Skills &amp; Activities section that I have "Experience in Winamp's Advanced Visualization Studio since November 2003".<br />
      <br />
      At the time it sounded like a good idea simply because I thought it would show commitment and because visualization sort of sounds artsy. Anyway, I know sure as shit that when I go in for the interview he's going to ask me what exactly AVS is. So I've been going it over in my head, and well, it's tough. I need something concrete that I can quickly reply to him without dawdling, unsure of what to say.<br />
      <br />
      It doesn't have to be very technical, even something slightly witty might be enough to persuade him to change the subject. Any ideas?</p>
