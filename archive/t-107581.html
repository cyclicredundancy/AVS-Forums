Takes a while to warm up but that is damned cool! The bullet effect is pretty nice, and the text effect is mega cool.<br />
<br />
Its just a shame that you used stick men..  but I guess that a guy made from ellipsoids or cuboids would have just slowed it down far too much.</div></div><hr />

Matrix revisited is the best Matrix preset I've ever seen.  Probably the first one with off-beat response.  On the text, though, I'd put about 15 semicolons (for blank spaces).  Maybe find a way to randomize the dynamic shift...?<br />
<br />
Do more stuff like this. :p Keep up the good work, man!</div></div><hr />

hmm?<br />
stick men are the coolest! and they are one of the few truly 'universly'(in Earth at least) accepted symbols<br />
<br />
yeah, the only other universal symbol i can think of is the sun</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm trying to do a lobby scene. I would like suggestions to other scenes you would like done in avs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Are you going to use ssc for the pillars? Are they going to have chunks being ripped out of them by bullets?<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is stick men fighting in AVS, you could copy one of the epic fight scenes from the matrix with stick men. Even better would be to make a generic hand-to-hand fight preset with the matrix style camera effects, using men made of ellipsoids of course.<br />
<br />
BTW you should release a matrix minipack or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd October 2002, 15:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, ssc for pillars, not sure about 'chunk's being ripped out though, might slow it down A LOT. <br />
<br />
At the moment, I've got the background layer and pillars done, the hardest part though is adding stickmen. Expect it to run slower than Reality. Also I should prolly rename these to more descriptive names.<br />
<br />
As for hand-to-hand fights, while I'm no xiao xiao, I'll have a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd October 2002, 16:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes ripping chunks would be slow. I just thought that perhaps in your eliteness you could see a better way of doing it than me. The way I would do it is to make a central cuboid for the pillar then wrap some smaller ones around each pillar (say 8 for each one) then make them shatter into triangles when they get hit and have them fade back in after the shatter animation is done. If you made the cuboids out of traingular faces I think that it would look good but unfortunately that method is really f**king slow (I've been working on shattering glass cubes) if you want it to look like solid triangles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd October 2002, 17:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Another method would be just darken patches on the pillars.<br />
<br />
And here's a sneak peak of an AVS animation program. (Requires VB6 runtimes)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I want a fuck scene :D<br />
<br />
Seriously!<br />
<br />
Actually, if you could do the scene of the actual matrix itself (the towers with the people in the pink tubs and lightning), flying down through it endlessly, that would be 73h ub3r</div></div><hr />
