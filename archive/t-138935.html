      <p class="post-content"><strong>OpenAVS (You have a better name?)</strong><br />
      Ok, so i have been coding for a few days now on a language system similar to the one used in avs, and so far, i have one that accepts variable declerations, and does math n'such. I am going to hopefully add in the ability to write custom functions, and possibly look up pre-written functions this weekend. If anyone has any ideas on a name for this project, it would be greately appreciated, as I was thinking of posting my code on sourceforge.net soon (all you coders best get in gear, and help me ;) ). I have some ideas of my own on how i would like to do the designing of presets etc.. in the new version, but am very open to suggestions. In the spirit of open source, i am also very happy to share around what i have written. Right now I am coding for the xmms system, but am writing it in a way that seperates core plugin code and pretty visualizer code in two seperate modules, that way we can hopefully have an easy time porting it to winders (yet another reason that i need some other developers on board with me). For the actual visualizer code, I was thinking that SDL would do a very nice job of rendering, and being free/portable. If anyone is interested, working in some OpenGL stuff would be a heck of a lot of fun too :)<br />
      <br />
      Let me know if you are interested, cuz im gunna need help with this one :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, ive been coding a pascal compiler from scratch for a side project, and to take up less time, i used flex/bison to do quicker generaton of the language rules, and lexical analysis. Worked out pretty well :) I hear there are ports for the winders, so if all goes well, this should be a damn portable project :)<br />
      <br />
      I was thinking of compiling to an intermediate code format - still to be devised of course - but that would run a heck of a lot quicker than interpreting every time it loads any ideas UCD? :D<br />
      <br />
      Currently it is very very interpreted... doesnt even translate into any sort of icode... so its way un-optimised, and needs some work... but i dont think that its going to be anything too major to get goin well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i thought of the names openvis or openviz, but actually both names were used for different projects already. coincidently openviz is an application from <a href="http://http://help.avs.com/OpenViz/news/ov_23.asp" target="_blank">avs.com</a>.<br />
      <br />
      well there's been a lot of talk about this before and it never resulted in anything. so i'm hoping your doing better, although i can't judge if pascal is optimal for this task. other programming languages might ease cross-development, and i'd love to see osx, linux and windows supported, maybe even (Open)BeOS. many other operating systems might have better multimedia-capabilities than windows. iirc, <a href="http://jheriko.deviantart.com" target="_blank">jheriko</a> was also interested in working on something like this. my suggestion is -since you sounded like you want to make it an open project- that you team up and register the project at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">sourceforge</a>. this might attract other people as well to work on it. but then it really needs a name. of course it would be nice if this new visualization plugin would be in a way compatible to avs. i don't know about the legal situation here, but then again nullsoft built in that svp loader, which plays sonique visualizations, <a href="http://www.sonique.com" target="_blank">sonique</a> is a product from lycos.<br />
      <br />
      so, back to the name issue. remember that this can be anything (i.e. 'dog', 'house' etc.), it doesnt need to have this close association to the name of avs. if you still prefer this, think of OpenVS, OpenAV or IVS (independent vs)... whatever.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, i like the sound of freevis a lot :)<br />
      <br />
      The pascal thingie was just a pascal compiler that i was working o as practice in writing lexers/parsers/compilers in c/c++. This one has a lot more avs syntax like syntax, and is still written in c/c++, but hasn't taken nearly as long as i wrote it with flex and bison. Well, if no one has any objections, should we go with FreeVIS?<br />
      <br />

      damn, i didnt click the link before i wrote that... does that mean that FreeVIS is out?</p>

      <br />
      Might as well build one big, decent compiler rather. I can make it output assembly (and thus be as fast as any regular code) rather than be interpreted. Think about how it is layed out:<br />
      - Is it typed or untyped?<br />
      - Support for objects?<br />
      - Extensible?<br />
      - Event-driven or linear?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Are you going to have it generate assembly only for the routines that do math type functions? or just have it spit out a shared object or the like?<br />
      <br />
      Also, what were you going to use for rendering your vis? I was going to try and go for a cross platform type thing, and use sdl to render, as that has been built for linux, winders etc. I thought that if we did it that way, we might be able to bring some new people into the community that were forced to oogle at presets made until then :)</p>

      Im going to commit the code for the assembler (for the virtual machine) that I have already, although, I'm going to stop work on that for now, and design the virtual machine. If anyone is interested in helping out, get setup on sf.net, and send me an email :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">This seems like a great project.. I'd love to contribute, unfortunately I have no good development environment at the moment... this computer is far too crappy and lacks any tools or the space to install such tools. I should have my old machine back soon though.. then i might be able to lend a hand. I have no real knowledge at all of compilers and parsers, I made a really shit command line interpreter once but thats about it. However I have a pretty fair knowledge of 3d programming and opengl. I've made lots of small 3d side projects before.. 3d rendering in qbasic several spinning cubes, particle systems and other such basic pap in opengl and endless vb and gdi crap too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I would love to have some extra help! :)<br />
      <br />
      Currently the project has changed course a bit, and im working on developing a virtual machine... dont ask me if this is the best route to go, but it does seem to be the most fun :) Maybe I should split the two projects apart, and focus solely on the visualizer &gt;.&lt;<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I am going to need help later on building visualization portion of the virtual machine bits... I havn't really posted any information on the architechure that I have sort of planned for this thing, but if anyone wants to start chatting on the sf.net forums for dilate, we could probably start to work thing out there :)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, currently I have it all building in Linux, but would like to move towards having it be cross platform, so any help from windows developers would be very much appreciated!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, like I said, I'm looking to make this a cross platform thing, which is why I was looking for some Win32 developers to help out with getting it running in windows. I'm not using any linux specific libraries right now, so it should compile just fine in windows.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I'm beginning to realize that this virtual machine project is more of a personal thing, that I would like to do, and isn't necessarily going to make the development of dilate go any quicker. So I found the ferite language parser, which looks pretty awesome, and very flexible. We could use that as the language parser for the preset, as it has a fairly small footprint, and just develop the interface to the various mp3 players out there seperatly. Sound ok?<br />
      <br />
      btw, Ferite is cross platform, so as long as we use something like SDL to do the windowing, we should be able to keep everything but the interface to the various players cross platform :)<br />

      definitely wrong, there's quite a lot free vj-tools for linux.<br />
      <br />
      i hope developing it for linux will ease porting it to osx.

        <p class="post-content">Actually, it should make it very easy :)<br />
        <br />
        I started developing ferite-sdl bindings, and the work is going fairly well. The thing that you might be interested in knowing is that ferite will build for osx, and so does sdl. This way, it should be pretty easy to port. Also, I just got an ibook, so I expect to be doing some work on porting it to osx ;)</p>
