<div class="posttext">I can't get AVS visualizations with an avi movie to render that movie.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?  I pray to Mike that someone can help me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you hopefully have the avi files copied into c:\Program files\Winamp\Plugins\AVS<br />
<br />
Okay...let's say you add a render AVI.  When you do this, do you see your avi file in the file selection area of the AVI area of the editor?<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then exactly what happens when you click the avi?  I assume the avi doesn't have any sound in it.  Could you give a little more background information on *what* happens when you do _________?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hello, Yes, my avi's are in that folder and yes I am able to select them from the editor. But no avi plays. The avi's do not have sound and they play normally in Window's media player. I have re-installed winamp several times, even trying older versions. The problem remains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So when you add the AVI, AVS doesn't lock up, it just doesn't play?  Do other AVIs work (ones that you haven't made...like ones that came with Winamp or somebody else's presets preferably)?  <br />
<br />
It might be a format problem.  Just because Media Player plays it okay doesn't mean AVS will recognize all formats.  How big is the file?  If it's not too big, I could have you e-mail me it.  (I have dialup, even though I have an unlimited e-mail server).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You are correct Sir. AVS doesn't lock up, it just doesn't play the movie. All other effects work fine. The presets with avi's that other people have made also have this problem. I have two very small avi's from published presets that would be good for emailing to you. One is 30KB the other is 10KB. But this would only verify that they are valid and should be displaying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not sure what to do since this doesn't sound like a bad file format problem.  I PMed you my e-mail, so you can e-mail me them if you want, but it doesn't seem to be as simple of a problem as I originally thought.  <br />
<br />
This sounds like more of a question for someone else.  Sorry I couldn't help you. :(</div></div><hr />
