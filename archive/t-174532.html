		It would be nice if I could get the title from any item in the playlist.<br />
<br />
$(getplaylisttitle:n)<br />
<br />
Where n is the playlist item number who's title it is I want to grab.

<br />
I dunno if this is what i'm looking for, but does this.<br />
IPC_GETPLAYLISTTITLE 212 [somenumber]<br />
<br />
Returns the title value of playlistentry [somenumber] right?

		Nah not like that tommy, i've done that already with $(title). Maybe I should explain the context of what i'm doing.<br />
<br />
I run a karaoke show Friday and saturday nights.  Whenever I cue up a song, I change the Id3 title tag to the name of the person that will be singing that song. This way I can just show the customers the winamp playlist if they want to see where they are in line.<br />
<br />
Using the overlay color feature of AVS I can display AVS behind the karaoke lyrics.  So far I can display a countdown timer behind the lyrics, so the singer know's how long they have to sing for...<br />
<br />
I'd like to put the name of the next title in the playlist instead of the current one, that way the countdown timer basically say's &quot;This is who is singing next, and this is how long you have to wait&quot;

		hmm what about a freeform skin with a slightly resized time display? :)<br />
another option would be to write you own (general purpose) plugin which displays the counter

		god sometimes i type like i smoke crack.. <br />
<br />
ok lets say this is the playlist..<br />
<br />
1. Banannas<br />
2. Summer Lovin<br />
3. Hot for teacher &lt;----currently playing<br />
4. Hound Dog<br />
5. Cruisin USA<br />
<br />
I'd like to specify which position i'd like to grab the title from. <br />
<br />
Right now we have $(title:n) which returns the currently playing title.  I'd like it if I could do a $(title:n)+1 to grab the next title, or $(title:n)+2 to grab the title 2 entries down the list. Alternatively having $(title:n)-1 to grab the previous title.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't care if it was added to the text renderer or a new superscope function as long as I could declare it as a reg function and render reg text.<br />
<br />
It just seems like too usefull a something too pass up.  Please consider adding this function to avs. Or if someone would be so l33t as to write an ape, i'd be very grateful.
