      <p class="post-content"><strong>Framerate Limiter - Request to UnConeD</strong><br />
      I know the Framerate Limiter idea is nothing new,but as i read that UnConeD has already written a FPS Detector ape, i thought that this could easily be transformed into an Framerate Limiter by inserting some delay code.<br />
      <br />
      This would be kinda great as i have a lot of best at xx.x fps presets!</p>

      <p class="post-content">and what if the framerate is below xx.x? what then?<br />
      <br />
      I think the biggest problem with this is that it might cause the framerate to be 'blocky'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">BLOCKY???<br />
      <br />
      Don't know what you mean by this.<br />
      <br />
      It could be done like this:<br />
      <br />
      Check fps<br />
      <br />
      If fps&gt;xx.x increase %loop%<br />
      If fps&lt;xx.x decrease %loop%<br />
      If fps=xx.x do nothing<br />
      <br />
      do some hungry processes for %loop% times (could be a double inversion of the frame for example)<br />
      <br />
      See if your pc is not able to even achieve xx.x fps the loop will be always 0.<br />
      <br />
      Otherways the ape will always adjust it to the desired fps.<br />
      <br />
      Quite simple, i'snt it? I'd do it myself, only prob is that i'm too busy with coding hotlist and my c++ knowledge is not the best.</p>

      <p class="post-content">obviously if the fps is already less than desired, you cant do much abuot it. but thats not the point. i think its a damn nice idea magicX</p>

      <p class="post-content">what I'm saying is that if you have a FPS slowing APE at the end, it would stop the processing for one frame. Thus, there would be 'delays' in the updates. (At least I think...not positive).</p>

      <p class="post-content">hang on, are you saying it will physically limit the fps, or just run code loops so that the preset is running slower.<br />
      <br />
      the second one should have no problems at all, because it is just like puting in heaps of pointless effects to slow it down.</p>

</pre><br />
      <br />
      That should do the trick, it measures the rendering time of everything except the APE itself and adjusts framerate accordingly. I don't feel like whipping up an APE project for it.

      <p class="post-content">Dunno, I still don't see the use of this. If a preset goes too fast, increase the AVS size and be amazed at the miracles of 400x300 or 512x384...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ahem, back to the Topic.<br />
      <br />
      Shreyas, go for it, will be great.<br />
      <br />
      And UnConed, you can go to higher res of course as the ape should always keep the fps if possible, so it won't limit the resolution you can do with it.<br />
      <br />
      But i recently watched old Presets i did on My Celeron 400 and now they ran on 63 fps and looked all messy unless i reduced the framerate to 20 again.<br />
      <br />
      That should be the purpose of this APE, getting the same effect on each machine no matter which hardware is used.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heh Blazer same with me. But try opening up Kazaa and clicking the theater tab. This causes the frame rate to be normal on my machine until I close Kazaa for some reason. Some other programs will do this as well, usually ones that have to do with multimedia type stuff. I don't know why this happens, though, or why the frame rate was stuck in the first place.</p>
