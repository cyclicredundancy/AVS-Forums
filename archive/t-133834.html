      Heh, finally got a new <b>original</b> preset. (well, not quite, just a teaser (and more of a scope than a whole preset)) Still needs some tweaking, and a better way to determine the twist.<br />
      <br />
      Comments and criticism, welcome.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Woah i love that cube. Excellent beat detection and movement. The twisting should happen with both scopes though. I know it's a ballache but that would look sweet. I tried something similar with an old 4d cube i made but it didn't work out too great. You've done it much better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The twsity lines overlap between the scopes. The original idea was to have it twist on all axes (that's why all side had the number of point in pps), but now I'm thinking it might be a bit confusing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah.. more twisting is required.. ide like to see it be twistable on all three axis, rather than just twisting the lines that run parralel with y=0.<br />
      <br />
      other than that.. get a b.g., and youve got a fucking marv preset..<br />
      i dont think i have ANY of your other stuff.. so i was very suprised.. but im not a very big part of the community here, so i could have easily missed all of your work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not much to miss. I have one pack that scored 3.5 about a year ago. Everything else is just on the board here. Thre were a couple of decent ones in the pack, but it was pretty missable. <a href="http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml;$sessionid$5HY4YZB4OEP5E5YAAAARC0I?componentId=101466" target="_blank">Link</a> if you want it.<br />
      <br />
      I have to get the twist to gradually end as well as begin. Right now it's only gradual at one end.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure what you meant by warp more freely Atero. :igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">emm...not get stuck in one place so much. it's hard to tell what it's doing when it's spinning so fast...slow down the rotation and speed up the twisting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Its a break dancing cube!<br />
      Anyway to make it more confusing, but i guess a little more interesting, is have the ends get closer and further apart, maybe even go through each other while still being warped and twisted.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I love it! You have an extreme amount of potential with this superscope. Obviously the preset needs a lot of work as far as aesthetics are concerned, though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, removed some variables, now it can twist on all three axes, but I can't get a nice shift between them. If I use the standard x=x*.9+y*.1 the corners get rounded and it looks like crap (same with x=x+(y-x)*.1).<br />

      <br />
      Anyway, I have five orignals (six if I can get this one working good) and a few mixes of them, and the twistiest tweak of Jeriko's (sp?) bizarre space twisting, lined up. I posted a request for mixes in the main forum but only Razand Magic replied, pust the total up to about 11 (I think). I'm aiming for 15.</p>

      <p class="post-content">haha, now THIS is a kinky preset :D The scope is fab (would be superb if you had done a milkpackage (not a package but I can't remember the word) of it ;) ) What would be also cool, is if you could make the one cube explode to many twisting cubes..could be quite hard tho.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, didn't get the multi-twist thing worked out, but I messed a bit in an attempt to make a decent preset out of it. This is what came of it. Better with the DM, or without, or with a DM that took longer to write than this message?<br />
      <br />
      I assume everyone here has picture 2, colour map, and convolution. If not, they should be available in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90097&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1" target="_blank">this</a> thread.<br />
      <br />
      P.S. I like the ide of using a water effect to create a flame like effect. :)<br />
      <br />
      P.P.S. The name of the preset is also the name on a song. It just seemed to fit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No offence but i really don't like that fire. It's slow and irritating and the colours don't look right. Plud you've gone majorly out of your way to create a fire effect on a scope. That can be done quite easily with just a few simple effects. Like this, it isn't perfect but it looks damn good in my opinion :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey man, don't wory about it, it's all about taste. I like the translucency of, and the glow around my fire. Yours is nice, but it can't do that. I'll see what I can do to speed it up (still tweaking after all).</p>
