<div class="posttext">AVS has gone Open Source at SourceForge.net, but what's with its source code?<br />
<br />
I couldn't find the source code nor any files.<br />
It seems as if someone left AVSs source code out to rot in the public while WinAMP has the latest source codes (not available to the public) and DLLs (bundled with the latest WinAMP downloads).<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what is happening (or what happened) to the source code and where it's available for download?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can get the source code from here (http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/) and you'll also want the last update from here (http://nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/).<br />
<br />
As for what happened when it went open source you can have a look at this (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=216394) thread.<br />
<br />
Any more than that, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the help QOAL and Yathosho.<br />
Just wondering if that was all to the changes at http://nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/<br />
Seems kind of odd that there are only 5 files included to update it.<br />
My friends all said that it does not change it into a v2.81d.<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
btw. Thanks anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Your friends all said?  Did they actually look?  If they did - do they code?  If they code - is it C++?  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty interested in building my own version and delving into the code (it keeps crashing on one of my boxes and I wanted a debug version) so I've just taken a quick look at the changes:<br />
<br />
&quot;main.cpp&quot; has a version number change, &quot;2.81b&quot; to &quot;2.81d&quot;.  There a chance, then, that 2.81c may have additional changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;render.cpp&quot; looks to contain the main change, which is a change in the way the ini-file path is generated (using a registered message versus a system call).  Nothing too exciting.<br />
<br />
&quot;res.rc&quot; changes the copyright message.<br />
<br />
&quot;wnd.cpp/wnd.h&quot; add a new accessor for getting the winamp window handle (used in &quot;render.cpp&quot; to send the message).<br />
<br />
I've not had a look around for the 2.81c source.  If anybody has it - let me know please!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It feels a bit mad answering my own post - anyway here goes...<br />
<br />
I couldn't locate the 2.81b source so I built up the 2.81c refresh with Visual Studio 2005.  I have gotten rid of all the compiler warnings except for the MMX EMMS warnings (I want to look into these in more detail).<br />
<br />
After some teething problems (it kept crashing until I realised I was trying to test it against WinAMP 2.95) it seems to be working fine and, my brief testing confirms that it certainly seems to look and act like the 2.81c version.<br />
<br />
If I get some time I'm going to try both profiling for bottlenecks and building it with the latest Intel Compiler (perks of the job) to see if ICC can work its optimizing magic.</div></div><hr />
