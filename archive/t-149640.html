      Ok I'm sorry If i thought too much of you guys, I mean I like you all, you are nice guys and all,but I only just try to show off that maybe you should try to learn programming, actually you just need the real spiritual thing, that's what I want to say :)<br />
      Sirit is the most powerfull thing you ain't got. Free your mind and don't believe what everything is in ya. you know try to think from your perspective of view, and when you are good, then you will maybe understand what I mean.<br />
      IN PEACE WITH YA, AND HEY DO NOT CLOSE TOPICS WHEN YOU WANT IT TOO.<br />
      IT WON'T HELP THE COMMUNITY.</p>

      We can program just fine. I've written several components for AVS that perform some complicated filters in realtime, only possible due to hand-optimized assembly coding.<br />
      Tom Holden's convolution APE compiles the kernel directly into tight code, which is even cooler.<br />
      <br />
      Just because you can tell a 3D card how to rasterize some triangles (so, you read the Direct3D/OpenGL docs) doesn't mean you're a good programmer. I'll be impressed if you deliver a plug-in that's as extensible and scriptable as AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">d00d, you really gotta lay off this. Now this is beginning to just turn into a flame fest - you are flaming AVS, and people are flaming you.<br />

      Nobody sees what point you are trying to make. Leave it be.<br />

      I locked the previous thread because you were just trying to cause trouble.<br />
      <br />
      There are a whole load of programmers here. Part of the skill of AVS is to do stuff that no others thought possible with a limited (compared to the full programming spectrum from the ground up)<br />
      <br />
      I respect you as one of the few visualization authors out there but your attitude is all wrong. By dissing another visualation esp. in a no constructive way does hold any respect. ANd from a personal level makes me less likely to get involved and try and help you make a better visualation that I do try and do (read you PM's and I will re-review you plugin)<br />
      <br />
      I have been more than fair with your constant spamming (here and in GD) but baiting others is not nice quailty. No more junk threads please you are pissing off people here, you can take this as a warning.<br />
