		First off, I'd like to mention that all of your presets have nice fast framerates (very good):):up:!<br />
<br />
In subdigital, I liked the overall visual effect:up:.  I (personally) prefer having the starfield with Additive enabled (so the stars look less like craters and more like stars).  But that's just my preference<br />
<br />
Another one I like the visual appearance of is supernova-death of a star.<br />
<br />
Dischord I thought was kind of cool because of its blitter feedback effect combined with the 2 superscopes that provides a semi-changing color combination (one stays same color, other scope changes colors).  You might even try adding another fireworks of a different color.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I couldn't see what was going on in the other presets :(.  A little too much visual stimulus for me, I guess <br />

		My fave, and the one with the most potentian IMHO was &quot;down the drain&quot;. I'd stick in another superscope of another colour right overtop of the one that's there, and make them both more reactive to the music. Here's a quick toss up. Needs to be polished and stuff, but it could be quite decent.

		heres a new one(im quick)<br />
i got the idea from turning superscope to lines on partical storm<br />
but i forgot how to get the weird grainy on beat clears(in my opinion the best part of partical storm

		Those are pretty good looking man. Heh, reminds me of my first few unreleased presets. I was such a dreamer. But even EL-VIS had to start somewhere (has anyone seen his first pack or two?). Maybe I oughta post my oldies someday.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my personal favourites are DISCHORD and subdigital. Good work, keep 'em coming.
