      I just became a senior member, and didn't even realize it until I was checking out my profile! Lol. I thought I clicked on the wrong profile at first, because I didn't think I would become a senior member until 150 posts.<br />
      <br />
      Sure there's already been a post like this, but to have something sneak up and surprise me is very unusual, so I thought I'd start a new thread.<br />
      <br />
      Yay!</p>

      Congrats on the senior membership. Now you can spout utter gibberish and have all the newbies think you know more than they do. :)</p>
