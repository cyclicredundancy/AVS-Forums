      Better? Don't like it because it is repetitive, slow and uses ugly colors.<br />
      <br />
      Besides, just because there's no law against something doesn't mean it's a good idea. Writing regular English is considered a form of politeness, so that the other party has minimal trouble in deciphering your message, making them more receptive to what you have to say. It also makes it especially easier for foreigners whose English is not perfect and should not learn from bad examples.<br />
      <br />
      It's a simple fact on the web: 'talk l1k3 diz' and you won't be taken seriously.</p>

      <p class="post-content">fletchface the people here are angry cause....dot you see it?<br />
      you start a new poll for every new preset you make and also they are not really that good to start a poll for .<br />
      Sure this is the Avs presets sub forum but that does'nt mean that it has to be filled with millions of threads and polls.<br />
      Try and make a pack of your presets and then post a poll on that OK?</p>

      <br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      Sorry can't give you any, the preset is repetive, has ugly &amp; grainy colors, is slow (that wouldn't matter if the preset were any good) and frankly looks like it's just a bunch of random effects thrown together.<br />
      <br />
      And if you would even try to act like a normal, polite &amp; intelligent person, instead of shouting "Im not a complete idiot, although im new here!!!" you could get a better &amp; more polite feedback about your work. Most of us really like to help new people if you just explain and tell your problem/question in a calm &amp; civil way.</p>
