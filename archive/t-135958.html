<div class="posttext">ok heres an pretty good preset i think. And  dont post if u dont like it because its a waste of time(for me and neone who reads it) also try to ignore the fact that im a newbie HERE because it doesnt mean im a complete idiot.   <br />

<div class="posttext">Interesting... FPS is a bit slow and the colors are kinda odd, but definately not the worst preset I've seen ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">regardless of your status unconed i dont appreciate your non-constructive comment and furthermore there is no law that says people cant shorten or abbreviate words and phrases.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and there's also no law against forcing people to shut down their computers when they install your software, but that doesn't change the fact that people who do that are assholes :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better? Don't like it because it is repetitive, slow and uses ugly colors.<br />
<br />
Besides, just because there's no law against something doesn't mean it's a good idea. Writing regular English is considered a form of politeness, so that the other party has minimal trouble in deciphering your message, making them more receptive to what you have to say. It also makes it especially easier for foreigners whose English is not perfect and should not learn from bad examples.<br />
<br />
It's a simple fact on the web: 'talk l1k3 diz' and you won't be taken seriously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">fletchface the people here are angry cause....dot you see it?<br />
you start a new poll for every new preset you make and also they are not really that good to start a poll for .<br />
Sure this is the Avs presets sub forum but that does'nt mean that it has to be filled with millions of threads and polls.<br />
Try and make a pack of your presets and then post a poll on that OK?</div></div><hr />

Ironically, today you'd actually be kinda hard pressed to find someone who types like that anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You want constructive critism?<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sorry can't give you any, the preset is repetive, has ugly &amp; grainy colors, is slow (that wouldn't matter if the preset were any good) and frankly looks like it's just a bunch of random effects thrown together.<br />
<br />
And if you would even try to act like a normal, polite &amp; intelligent person, instead of shouting &quot;Im not a complete idiot, although im new here!!!&quot; you could get a better &amp; more polite feedback about your work. Most of us really like to help new people if you just explain and tell your problem/question in a calm &amp; civil way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think the last line you said Tugg is slightly incorrect. You we do try to answer questions, but think of Atero, and then think theat we answer questions in a 'calm &amp; civil way'. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd May 2003, 13:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Uhm, yeah, well Atero is Atero :D (no offense Atero! ;))<br />
<br />
Heh, calm &amp; civil might not be the right adjectives, but if you act like that, then we act like that, or atleast i hope so :weird:</div></div><hr />
