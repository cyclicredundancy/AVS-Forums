			<strong>Fast processor and slow framerate</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi everybody. I'm posting this one because I just bought a PIII 933Mhz processor, added 128 Mb RAM with 133Mhz bus and 16 megs video card; I installed Winamp 2.76 and the AVS in windowed mode runs very fast, so I thought it would run the same way in fullscreen mode, but it didn't. I just get an average of 10 fps, and if the preset is simple I can get 12 fps. So I'm asking, what the f*** is happening?. I understand that fullscreen AVS in Pentium 200Mhz cannot run fast, but I just don't find any explanation for this. If anyone can tell me something about this issue, well, just post a reply. I ain't got nothin else to say or write, so bye, and see ya'll aruond.:cool:

		change your resolution of your fullscreen and also make sure its on a certain bpp (16,24,36    16 faster, 32 more color)

			<strong>Yep..</strong><br />
		
		

		You'll also want to unchek the &quot;wait for retrace&quot; box, that'll speed it up. DOn't bother tryinganything bigger than 400x300 resolution-wise, it's just too processor-hogging. I run it on an Athlon 850 at 320x240 32bpp withpixel doubling off (basically the same as 640x480 with pixel doubling). It runs around 20fps for the more hardcore presets and around 30-40 for less intense ones.<br />
<br />
 Hope this helps..
