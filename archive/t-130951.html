      <p class="post-content"><strong>APE programming with Delphi</strong><br />
      Well maybe this belongs to Troubleshooting, maybe not. I'm just posting here, so don't mind, it can get moved later if necessary.<br />
      <br />
      What i wanted to ask is the following, has anyone some exoerience with APE-Programming in Delphi? I know C rocks, but it's damn difficult to pot that code.<br />
      <br />
      It would be great if anyone had basic APE sources for Delphi which i could use, then i could blast all my programming knowledge into it instead of painfully porting it line by line.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dont know, I too have the same problem, anyway I have coped up with it..can you write apes in Visual Basic?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, i dont do VB, in fact i have even less knowledge in VB than in C, mostly based on the Fact that i dont like VB.<br />
      <br />
      Shreyas, pleas do one thing and dont introduc a "Shreyas dumb APE's" Category, PLEASE DONT! Use Render APE or Render instead, because if you got many APE's the category list is already filled up enough.<br />
      <br />
      The APE itself is actually just another bouncy version of the torturial one :p I'd like it more if it had some colorfading.<br />
      <br />
      If you dont know how, post me your sources, i'm gonna do it for you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay reasons why you will never make APEs in VB/Delphi.<br />
      <br />
      Delphi first:<br />
      <br />
      1.) Delphi is based on Pascal.<br />
      2.) Pascal was designed to teach programming by being an easier, slower and generally less powerful version of C.<br />
      3.) Delphi is intended for rapid application development (e.g. making crappy database programs)<br />
      <br />
      Net result: Delphi = Shit language for making anything that needs to be fast<br />
      <br />
      Now to explain why VB would be crap for APEs here take the above explaination replacing the word Delphi with VB and Pascal with Basic.</p>
