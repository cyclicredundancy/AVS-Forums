		yet another thread posted by me! i'm becoming a bit of regular!<br />
<br />
watching milkdrop for a bit, cos i'm bored, i think to myself...<br />
<br />
&quot; how is this so fast with all these effects? Why isn't avs this fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
if milkdrop can acheive these sort of speeds, why can't the technology be used in avs? I think this would be a substantial advantage, as there is  <i>so</i> much more you can do in avs, combining the two would produce some awesome presets.<br />
<br />
reply if your interested.<br />
<br />
p.s.  sorry if i'm reviving an old thread, couldn't be bothered to search before hand.

		*Sigh* Loads of threads about this in the FAQ.<br />
<br />
A whole section devoted to it.<br />
<br />
Imagine what would happen if everyone couldn't be bother to reply if the poster couldn't be bothered search.

		You definitely aren't reviving an old thread since you created a new one, but this topic has been discussed to some extent before.<br />
<br />
AVS could be much faster - it uses only the CPU to do the graphics processing.  It could be sped up a lot if it used the video card instead.  The main reason AVS hasn't been updated is because Nullsoft has basically thrown it away for the time being(seemingly forever) and focused on their other projects(winamp 2.9, winamp 5, WASTE, etc).  I wouldn't expect for them to ever modify AVS, although they could be working on it without telling us(highly unlikely, IMO).<br />
<br />
Basically, AVS has reached its pinnacle.  There's not much left to do with it(the reason why several AVSers have left) and there is no hope of an update for the time being.<br />
<br />
I wanna make my own AVS-type program, but I need a little more skill first.  Give me a couple years and hopefully I'll have something out. *crosses fingers

(i suppose)

		Summary:<br />
Videocards are 'stupid machines' that can only do certain things very fast. Milkdrop is more limited than AVS, so it can work on a video card. Doing AVS on a videocard is becoming possible now that videocards have pixel-shaders, but few people have such cards. It would also require a redesign from the ground up.<br />
<br />
Except for a few fanatics, the AVS and Milkdrop communities are quite friendly to eachother ;).

		The good thing probably is that there is &quot;les noobiens&quot; than in the field of avs, bad thing of course being the lack of variety, but i think milkdrop has part of the blame in that issue...

Only a half one since he is only part-time at the forums. But we still enjoy him. Can't a Mod change his level from &quot;Forum King&quot; to &quot;AVS Forums Mascot&quot;??? :p :p :p
