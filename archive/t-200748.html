      <p class="post-content"><strong>OK again about vis overlay support</strong><br />
      Now I've been bringing up this issue for ages now that that stupid vis window can't be rid of if you choose desktop overlay mode in vis settings but at least you could hide it and if you toggled the win amp to disappear it went with it.<br />
      when will win amp clue in to the fact that in desktop overlay mode the vis window should disappear and is not needed LoL<br />
      <br />
      but now with ver 5.06 you can only hide it temporary and then the darn thing pops back on the screen no matter what you do grrr instead of better it now impossible to get rid of the stupid thing this has been a bug since god know how long and now is even a bigger bug. one of the main reasons I like win amp is the desktop overlay vis setting that no other program has but win amp but now its useless<br />
      <br />
      anyways is there someway to get rid of it from showing ?<br />
      why does it not go away when win amp is toggled gone ?<br />
      (it does stay away for 5 sec then it pops in the middle of the screen)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      anyways TIA if ya know a solution to this issue cus its driving me mad and up the wall<br />
      <br />

      Works for me :igor:<br />
      Im afraid there isn't really any other solution to it, you could perhaps have winamp and avs on a secondary monitor if you want to have the controls in vision and set the desktop color as something bizarre that you never use (green for example).<br />
      Other than that... there's not really much you can do unless you discover some magical bug or something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i turn on the overlay mode and set the desktop to the colour, resize the avs window to my preferred resolution, and then minimize winamp, with it goes also the avs window minimized. simple as hell if you have all settings on default.<br />
