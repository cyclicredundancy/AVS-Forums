<div class="posttext">Hi.. im sorry if this has been posted allready but i looked and i couldnt find anything about my problem.<br />
 <br />
Im using the latest version of winamp and i have vista ultimate...<br />
Basicly.. One day my avs editor worked fine.<br />
<br />
But then i went to edit an avs i was given buy a friend of mine. and the player says that the avs editor is open but its not on the screen.. now i know what your thinkin. but i have gone through the steps to ensure that all open windows are shown on the screen. i.e deleting the neccery file in the win amp folder.<br />
<br />
So all the open screens are showing... honestly<br />
<br />
but the AVS editor is not there.<br />
<br />
i was then foolish enough to try Docking the current visual in the avs editor... which didnt work but it did mean that i      no longer have any AVS at all...<br />
<br />
So i tried upgrading again and it fixed the AVS screen so i could see them again.. but no edit screen still.<br />
<br />
So i left it a while untill it started to bug me, i tried upgrading again just to see if it would help. but it actualy   <br />
made my AVS stop working all together.<br />
<br />
Sorry For such a long post. But it saves me posting the details one buy one as you ask for them. Not that i wont if you do ask, but you see the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
can somebody please help me. i realy need to mess with some AVS. its bugging me.<br />
 Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hrmm well the only place the editors position etc is saved is in winamp.ini.<br />
<br />
[AVS]<br />
...<br />
cfg_docked=0<br />
cfg_cfgwnd_open=0<br />
cfg_cfgwnd_x=711<br />
cfg_cfgwnd_y=529<br />
...<br />
<br />
but since you already said that you have deleted the ini, I'm stumped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tell me about it..<br />
<br />
Ive tried everything even a total re-install didnt do it.<br />
Even went and manualy removed any Reg entries that win amp leaves in the registry.<br />
<br />
Its actualy getting worse.<br />
<br />
now i cant even right click on the winamp title bar and get the menu for transparency or any of the other window settings.<br />
<br />
I can the playlist right click menu and if i right click on any of the buttons i get there right click menus.<br />
<br />
But not the ones you get when you right click on the title bars..(i.e where it says winamp or playlist editor.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Wimamp is just broken. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry to hear about that. I use Winamp on Vista fine by some miracle...<br />
<br />
I'd advise a clean reinstall, its a last resort but usually works.<br />
<br />
Do you have any funky tools installed that mess with UI things? They could be the source of the problem... right click not working is too simple to be Winamp's fault IMO. That is the result of the OS or some third party software being broken or interfering with Winamp...</div></div><hr />
