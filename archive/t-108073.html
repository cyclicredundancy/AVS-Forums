<div class="posttext">1. Ability set AVS window sizes from preset code. And flag in settings to disable this.<br />
2. Arrays in some manner. One wrote about store\recall pair - this is same as arrays. But arrays are greatly needed. Of course arrays will require function to quickly fill them by data.<br />
3. GLOBAL VARIABLES! I read current wishlist but I wanna tell again - this MUST HAVE. And I'd like add one suggestion here - not exactly global. I suppose better create some &quot;Misc&quot; function, for example &quot;Variables&quot;. If it is included to &quot;Main&quot; section - then all variables listed there are global. If is included in &quot;Effects list&quot; - then variables are global for just this list.<br />
4. Simple effect &quot;Glow&quot;. It is quite hard to implement it on AVS code. But it looks very nice - like light around shining object. Of course it must have controls as obvious glow (in Photoshop) has - at least color, size, opacity.<br />
5. More editing options. Search\replace in code. Multiplie effects selection in tree window. Ability to export\import to text file. May be finction &quot;Import &lt;textfile&gt;&quot; (Ok, ok, I understand...)<br />
<br />
One thing looking as bug. Ok, I use program TClockEx. It's window replaces standard Windows clock. Very useful and popular program. But when I switch AVS to fullscreen - then TClockEx window flashes twice per second over AVS. Quite ugly. I DID NOT see same effect in any other program in fullscreen mode - not in Win Media Player, not in any MPEG-1\2\4 video player. With WinAmp I have to turn clock off when I like open fullscreen AVS.<br />
<br />
And finaly dreams... I dream about interface to OpenGL... :-D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think you'll find UnConeD's upcoming texer effect will be sorta like a glow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can use the convolution filter to make some glow effects too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey guys, you'd post a link here. This is a BIG stack of files.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is not exactly Glow. Unfortunately it doesnt' accept expressions, variables etc. Just imagine glow depending of level. And if glow will have start and finish angles then it can be used to simply create beams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sound like what you were really looking for then was the superscope. You can use the ssc to create light beams that give a glow effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yea, but they sucks processor. My favorite preset is Elvis's pulsar from original bunfle. It has glow effects but jist imagine - how much time I will need to create glow on LEDs in my UV-meter. I like glow effect. even some time ago I created WinAmp2 skin named &quot;black more&quot;. You can find it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I love the idea of coded window sizes.<br />
<br />
One other idea that could work with that is custom framerates:<br />
Optimize the window within certain size constraints so that the framerate works at the speed the author likes best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">And I would add ability change &quot;Pixel doubling&quot; flag from the AVS code.</div></div><hr />
