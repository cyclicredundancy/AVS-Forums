      <p class="post-content">Truly impressive<br />
      I like the 3D ones most...<br />
      <br />
      Tentacles:<br />
      it looks alive<br />
      <br />
      Fractals:<br />
      well, they're fractals. I don't know how you made them,<br />
      but they look awesome as fractals do<br />
      <br />
      Mechanical Curvatrue:<br />
      really nice 3D shapes<br />
      <br />
      To Boldy Go:<br />
      I like this one. why dont you paint your models? I mean - they look realistic, they just need a touch of paint.<br />
      I noticed that you have over 100 super scopes. Good to see that AVS can handle it. Gives me some ideas...<br />
      <br />
      XWing vs Tie:<br />
      Nice result. Perhaps coders should form teams and delegate tasks like model creation, world creation, special effects etc</p>

      <p class="post-content">The problem with colouring superscope models is occlusion... maximum blending monochrome objects is the cheapest way to do it.. originally the starship model from 'To Boldy Go' had blue glowy plasma on the warp nacelles and a blue deflector dish... occluding them was so damned slow and not very good though so I had to ditch them. The method I was using was to buffer restore the whole thing then render over the things in the foreground. I'm not sure that there is a better way... at least that I can understand. EL-VIS seems to have a reliable replace mode 3D going on.. but I can't make head nor tail of his code... its just too messy for me. :p<br />
      <br />
      I like your idea about coders forming teams to create different parts of a preset... I did try to form a team doing something like this before.. one member working on SSC model, one on a DM etc... but it never took off.<br />
      <br />
      The fractals are actually pretty simple... they are julia sets of order 2, 3, 4 and 5 morphing together with the standard tweening method of using var1*x1+var2*x2 where var1+var2=1;<br />
      <br />
      I'm glad you enjoyed my presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think this can be solved by severe fading of brightness away from the camera, as I had have done with 3D vector presets.<br />
      I used colours combined with fading - although I haven't tried this with surfaces.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Excellent excellent pack here.<br />
      <br />
      I love that intro, it's just so clean and to the point, yet so stylish. Plasmastorm reminds me of jabu jabu's belly on zelda: occarina of time. Aw i wanted to do the enterprise in one of my many ideas for space presets. :p<br />
      <br />
      Overall just absoloutely excellent. And more unconed goodness at the end can't be bad. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh god, i know the feeling. All those scopes for my stellated dodecahedron, so tedious going through every scope just to change one number. Argh. Very satisfying when you save and reopen and it all works perfect. And you sigh and realise it's 6am.</p>

      Jesus dude, that is a nice pack indeed :)<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      Jheriko? You've used Pimpbot to generate the .exe, right? I want to do that for my pack as well, but I can't find the .exe after the compiling. You know where I can find it? The readme file says it should appear on my desktop, but it doesn't. I know it requires NSIS 2.0. I have that. Should it be in the same directory, or does NSIS 2 have to run in order to have pimpbot working?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for advice in advance,<br />

      </blockquote>I had that problem also, if you get NSIS 2b3 (which you have) and pimpbot v1.0.5, you should be fine, it worked for me. You probably just don't have the latest version of pimpbot.

      <p class="post-content">VJ chutnov is ridiculously awesome. The camera motion is extremely well thought out, of course xwing vs tie fighter is well done too.<br />
      <br />
      i see you took your just another tunnel II to new heights , remembering how it was when you first presented it as a work-in-progress. i assume vj chutnov is based on this work.<br />
      <br />
      not quite a bendy tunnel looks great. is the dynamic movement how most tunnels are done?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Most tunnels are made using DMs, because thats the only good way to make a solid tunnel. SSCs have been used to make a tunnel(UnConeDs tie fighter preset comes to mind) - they just aren't solid tunnels.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The fake torus tunnel is done by intersecting a sphere and a one sheet hyperboloid to approximate (quite badly) a torus.<br />
      <br />
      VJ Chmutov is something a little bit special compared to the rest of the pack, it uses a new raytracing method. Also its almost 100% UnConeD's work and not mine, although I've used the same technique in the presets I have ready for my next pack and also in the Space Torus II preset which I've given a preview of on deviantart.</p>
