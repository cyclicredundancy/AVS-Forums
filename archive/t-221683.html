		I don't know which one you meant, especially if you don't tell us who created it.<br />
<br />
So i'll say: go ahead and do it.<br />
<br />
Don't count on me though, I suck at remixing.

		Er...sorry. I wasn't familiar with this one, but I like it. I wouldn't dare try to remix it. If it ain't broke, don't fix (or remix) it!<br />
<br />
But seriously, I agree with WoTL. If you have some idea of what should be done to it, go for it. The worst that can happen is it looks like crap. In that case you just don't show it to anyone;)

		See, the thing about this preset is that it's all the random movement that makes the preset. You can sit there adding convo filters and colormaps all you want; you may even get some really cool effects. But in the end, it is the movement that makes this one cool, imho. Yes, I suppose you can tweak the movement a bit, but WHY? It sort of begins to become another preset when you start changing DMs, so if you're willing to do that, you might as well make an original. As I said I will not fool with this one, Anything I could do would not be an enhancement or tribute to the first, and isn't that what remixes are for? ;)
