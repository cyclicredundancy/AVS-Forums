      just something i made quickly today.<br />
      most of the code was stolen from my bounce preset, but it still required a lot of work.<br />
      a nifty thing i discovered while making this is a way to fix the first and last point from overlapping when drawing a circle using;<br />
      <br />
      x=cos(i*$PI*2);<br />
      y=sin(I*$PI*2);<br />
      <br />
      instead of using $PI*2, which cases the first and last points to overlap (not very nice when using a texer2 on addative blend and having a single point twice as bright as the rest), i used $PI*(2-2/n)which distances the first and last point the same ammount as all the other points. yay!<br />
      mm just thought i'd share my discovery.<br />
      <br />
      i know the preset's kinda empty, but i suck at backgrounds and such. stil.. let me know what you think!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks wotl!<br />
      i had another shot and got something that worked.. changed the scope so it went inwards and out-wards (turns out you cant say "0utwar" here without it coming up as ******). so yes.. now it's fixed and finished.<br />
      enjoy!</p>
