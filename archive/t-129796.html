      Do you feel restless after making an incomplete preset and sleeping?<br />
      or can you sleep sound when you cant get something right and you have tried all night?<br />
      <br />
      i dont, i just keep thinking about it and cant sleep.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No. Can't really say that i lose my sleep over an incomplete preset. Though i admit that sometimes the sessions when i make presets go long in the night :)<br />
      But that's just, because once you pop you can't stop :D</p>

      &lt;edit&gt; thats funny that post wasnt there when i posted this the first time:igor:<br />
      I like it, its simple. I had something like this in mind when I asked you to do it, but you are right I should keep this one:).<br />
      <br />
      Cant decide on using the black&amp;white one,or shaded one and weather to have transparency and the ugly edge or no transparency and a square around it:igor:<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; OK this one looks the sexyest I think and it looks transparent half the time:D</p>

      <br />
      [backtotopic]<br />
      Anyway, no i don't lose my sleep over a preset that isn't quite ready and needs something more. But sometimes when i have an idea for a preset i want to make it haunts me when im awake, i just can't get my mind of an idea until i make it. But rarely i get ideas that i can actually execute in avs :(</p>
