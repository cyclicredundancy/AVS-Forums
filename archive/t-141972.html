      I'm a complete n00b and I don't know how to upload my vis. I heard there was somewhere for budding AVS artists where they could get feedback. Where is this area?</p>

      <p class="post-content">upload presets before they are done in the Presets subforum for feedback. Before asking a question:<br />
      1. read the FAQ<br />
      2. Read the 2 tips and tricks threads<br />
      3. Search the forums<br />
      <br />
      When you are ready to submit it to the Plug-ins section, PM sawg. Tell him you want a deluxe account, which costs $10 a year. This will let you upload your visualizations here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh, ok. I just realized that I have never been in that forum. Weird. This site has way too many forums that I would never go into.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, Strider:<br />
      The process is easy.<br />
      -Go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com</a><br />
      -Click on the components tab<br />
      -Click on the "Submit a Component" link - it's right up there in the top right of the screen.<br />
      -You will need to make a winamp user account first - doing this shouldn't be hard<br />
      -Once you have an account go back to the "Submit a Component" page, and sign in with your username.<br />
      -Click "Publish a New Skin or Component" on the right of the screen.<br />
      -Follow the instructions.<br />
      <br />
      Note: You can only upload an executable, so you have a couple of options on what to do:<br />
      1. Learn NSIS and make your own nifty installer script.<br />
      2. Use someone else's installer script - several AVS people have nice ones - you will just have to make some slight modifications.<br />
      3. This is the easiest one, but also the least professional - just use winamp to create a self-extracting archive.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps. If not, just axe more questions.</p>
