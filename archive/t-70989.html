<div class="posttext">I think I kept true to the original form, but still changed it enough to look much better. Disable the water effect if the framerate is too low.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Solamon, can you help me with something?<br />
<br />
You see how you got that screenshot of an AVS up there?<br />
<br />
Can you help me put one of my AVS's as an avatar?<br />
<br />
I just need to know how to take a screenshot of the file and save it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">aaron, do this, <br />
<br />
press &quot;print screen&quot; when running your preset<br />
then open up you favorite pic program (paint or paint shop pro)<br />
and then paste the screen shot on the image surface and then shrink it to 50*50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">aaron595</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2002, 20:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So, where does it save the file to?<br />
<br />
I pushed it, but it just kept going, and nothing new came up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I opened it in Paint, since I have no other programs, and it took the whole screenshot.  Isn't there a way to get rid of all that other junk it took a picture of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">aaron595</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2002, 20:54</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Ahh, there we go.<br />
<br />
I just used MyImager.com<br />
<br />
That place rules!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It doesn't save the screenshot, it puts it on the clipboard so you can paste it in your painting program with the CTRL+V command.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">okay, i know i havent been on for a few days so i kinda missed out on this mini contest<br />
besides i dont want to download all of these at once, think im crasy. no offence guys.<br />
<br />
but i want to add a new beginer here, sam erules as always, no deleting the orignal trans effects and rander objects. <br />
and its okay it change the settings &quot;just a little&quot; and not too much either. (&lt; my only addition to the rule.)<br />
enjoy</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice work FlatMatt. I really liked your preset.<br />
<br />
I have a question though. I entered into the comp but I wasn't even included in the results. Whats that all about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Montana</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th January 2002, 10:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">solamon, your preset was disqualified because you deleted one simple thing, THE COMMENT, remeber that all of the original things had to be included</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th January 2002, 11:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wooooow, 2/5, unbelievable, I finished it in 30 sec :D. I know the comp is finished but here's a later version :D (still not finished).<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, congrats Flatmatt I told you you'll win :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">WHAT!? :mad:I was disqualified because I deleted the comment file!!! Thats some real stupid $#!+. I just think you made that crap of an excuse  afterwards as a reason to bias me. JaY's preset didn't have the comment file included either, but he seemed to get 1st runner up! (BTW, I'm not trying to dis your preset JaY, it was definatly really good.) His preset didn't even have the same tunneling movement effect. Why don't you explain that to me?! I put in the effort to participate in your little 'contest' and all I'm asking is for is recognition in the lineup. My preset wasn't easy to make and I worked on it for a couple of days before submitting it. I don't know why you feel the need to disacknowledge it. It's insulting to me AND it compromises the integrity of your contest. What the hell is your problem Montana?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whatever man. :mad:You're pathetic. Pushed up against a wall and all you can do is swear. This is a public forum. It's obvious you don't have good judgement and now it's obvious you have no tact. It's just pathetic.:hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yep,you are absolutely right, Salomon-i have deleted both the comment and changed the name of the preset. My Ass Should be just as much kicked outta the competition as yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks for speaking up JaY. Truthfully, I don't really care about the contest. It just bothers me that I was removed and then when I inquire about it, I get some stupid blow-off answer. Why would someone respond like that? And then he swears up a storm afterwards! What??? How amatueristic. This is a public forum. COME ON NOW!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">to open these files you need to take them to winamp/plugins/avs and then turn the advanced visualisation plugin on.search for the preset in the list</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">solamon i forgot you in the contest, <br />
i'm sorry about that but i still like your preset. <br />
you would have got a 3 / 5 for your preset<br />
<br />
i don't wanna start a flamewar, even though you guys (jay and solamon) wanna do it, i don't care abot the contest anymore coz it's over. and oh yeah, <br />
<br />
jay&gt;&gt; you were a special case, because you did such a nice remix, i kept you in the contest even though you removed the comment, and you would have won but you removed the comment so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">solamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th January 2002, 11:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It's alright then. I understand that everyone makes mistakes and I don't want to start a flame war either.  I appreciate your honesty. We both share a common interest in AVS and there is no reason we have to fight or argue. Thanks bro.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I Do NOT want to start a war. No way,Montana. Ask whover artist you want that i have never tried to insult anybody's work no matter it is good or crap according to my taste. I never try to change anybody's stile or tell him what to do. I only give advice on how i THINK (yes,enough smart talk, people we re talking serious now) and NEVER critize without a point.I said all this just to show you and everybody else on this forum (to which i am new) that my intentions are good and wanna help any newbies in AVS (practically that was the idea of AVSociety). We all should be treated fairly and like one. There should be no difference between newbie and stoneage avsrs,between good and not so good (everyone likes what he has created best-he has put his own ideas and mood in his presets).<br />
 BTW i am very glad you liked the preset i made :)-it's just that the inspiration caught me and hit me with that dinamic movement i have been thinking of lately and couldn't stop myself with changing it :rolleyes: Anyways i am glad it all sorted out and i hope noone will go out angry of that little collision of hmmm whatever we had here.<br />
 Cyall.And don't stop AVSing :D :D <br />
