      <p class="post-content"><strong>Trouble submitting an AVS</strong><br />
      Plz help me someone,<br />
      <br />
      I have just finished my first AVS called "What are the stars singing" and I tried to upload it onto the Winamp site but it said that I had the wrong file format or something, My file has to be an .exe file (executable) but it is still a .avs. is there some external program that I am supposed to use for compiling my AVS's.<br />
      <br />
      Also maybe I was in the wrong area but where do I submit my AVS's?<br />
      <br />
      Any assistance would be greatly appreciated :) :) :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use NSIS to package them together (get it from the Develop section). I suggest you don't submit your first AVS though, for the following reasons:<br />
      <br />
      - If it's your first, you're probably still learning. Submitting to Winamp.com takes a while (2-3 weeks), so by the time it's published, it's not representative of your skills anymore.<br />
      <br />
      - If it's your first, it's probably not very advanced. Even though you might think it's very cool that you've made it, others will probably think "bah, this is boring" or "been there done that". Take a critical look at it and compare it to other AVSs.<br />
      This doesn't mean that you should stop because you're not good enough, but that you should practice some more because you're not good enough <u>yet</u>. Big difference...<br />
      <br />
      - It's only one preset. The library on Winamp.com is already huge, and adding tons of individual presets will only make it more messy and hard to find good presets. Wait until you have a nice collection to show off. This will make it more impressive and will encourage more people to download it (some people are too lazy to download individual presets).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      However, in the meantime I suggest you post them here on the AVS Presets forum. You'll get instantaneous feedback (instead of having to wait for weeks), and you'll get feedback from people who also make AVSes. They can give you advice (instead of just saying 'this is boring/too simple').<br />
      <br />
      Oh and this applies to mostly any publishing community, not just AVS :).</p>
