		They must be the wrong type of picture file.  Change them to a gif or jpg file and then it will work.  Just load them into a graphics program (photoshop or something) and then resave them as a gif or jpg file.

		Sorry, but this is a REALLY confusing request!<br />
<br />
Are you having trouble with:<br />
<br />
Adding Pictures to Presets?<br />
Adding Pictures to your Installer?<br />
Uploading Pictures somewhere?<br />
<br />
The more precise your request is, the better we can help you.

		hey, I had the same problem when submitted my pack. It says that the pic(s) must be in .jpg or in .gif format, I used jpeg file format but it just gave me errors claiming that the pictures are not in requested format. Then used gif format and it worked.... I think it could've something to do with the file size of picture, dunno..

		<b>Convert</b> it to .gif or .jpg. Make sure you have not just renamed it:<br />

eg:<br />
mypicture.bmp (original)<br />
mypicture.gif (changed name)

Yes, whenever I save something to a gif file it loses a lot of color information and looks super ugly.<br />
<br />
Hey, does anyone know - Is there a difference between jpg and jpeg files?

		Yes, the file extension of .jpeg is one of those gay four letter file extensions that offends people like me who still think that all file extensions should be &lt;3 letters long... it took me long enough to get used to filenames being bigger than 8 chars!<br />
<br />
Seriously though there is no difference, they both use the same encoding method.

		I don't really like the long file extensions.  They are a bit weird.  Just kinda seem awkward whenever I see them.  Especially when there are some that are 12+characters long.

		&lt; 5 letters == good, any more than four is just annoying.  there is something to be said about descriptive extensions, but when the extension is longer than the filename itself it's fucking irritating.

		Seriosuly though three letters = 26^3 = 17576 combinations... thats most likely more file extensions than those currently existing in use.

		yeah well how many of them are actually descriptive of anything?  and what about things like .fuk and .sex and .cnt? ;)<br />
<br />
seriously, there's also conflicts between file extensions - like .sun could be a sun networks file, or it could be a super uber noobie.  (okay, bad example.)  you run into problems of being specific so you don't fuggle users' file associations but still being recognizable.  hence the fourth letter.  although there is NO excuse for nonstandardization of .html versus .htm or .mpeg versus .mpg....

		In fact, multiple use of the same extension is already widely spread.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone should introduce standard file recognition tags, so we could skip extensions.

Apple already thought of that. More than 10 years ago too.

		And most programs have a filetype tag within anyway, so what's the point?<br />
<br />
Microsoft &amp; Co just needs to pull up some standards and make Windows use em. This would be way easier to find the prog a file has to be opend with. Furthermore the tag could contain information about where the prog can be found on the net if it is not available.

		On the original problem of .gif and .jpg not being recognised by winamp.com, I'm now having it.. with mspaint saved .gifs and .jpgs too... what could be more standard?<br />

		That's funny thinking MSPaint's file formats would be 'standard'. If there is any format breaker, it's Microsoft. Try finding a copy of Paint Shop Pro 4, since it's old and most of it's formats are accepted. It can even edit masked PNG's, but not the stupid Microsoft format ones, the proper ones.

		Ironically I used PSP 3.11 to originally save the .jpg, then mspaint afterwards assuming it would be more standard.
