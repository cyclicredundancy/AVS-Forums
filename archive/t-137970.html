      <p class="post-content">yes...it is very easy<br />
      <br />
      x1a=...(insert code here);<br />
      y1a=...;<br />
      z1a=...;<br />
      x2b=...;<br />
      y2b=...;<br />
      z2b...;<br />
      <br />
      x1=x1a*p+(1-p)*x1b;<br />
      y1=y1a*p+(1-p)*y1b;<br />
      z1=z1a*b+(1-p)*z1b;<br />
      <br />
      p is a value from 0 to 1.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      btw...this was in the tips and tricks thread. you should have searched the forums. also there is instructions on how to do it with three variables.<br />
      <br />
      of course, you can also get cool effects if you use seperate variables for p for x, y, and z (i.e. use px, py, pz) this way, you will have much more variation in the SSC.</p>

      <p class="post-content">this really wasnt in the tips and tricks thread.. to search for it you would of had to know that it uses linear filtering method to achieve its ends.. [the x=b*pt+c*(1-pt) part]<br />
      <br />
      But yeah, its reasonably easy as long as you understand how it works.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The general rule is:<br />
      <br />
      To morph between n shapes, pick weights w<font size="1">1</font>, w<font size="1">2</font>, ..., w<font size="1">n</font>. So that<br />
      <br />
      <font size="1">n</font><br />
      <font size="3">***931;</font> w<font size="1">i</font> = 1 (and usually 0 &lt; w<font size="1">i</font> &lt; 1)<br />
      <font size="1">i=1</font><br />
      <br />
      For coordinates x<font size="1">i</font>, y<font size="1">i</font>, z<font size="1">i</font>, you calculate:<br />
      <br />
      &amp;#160;&amp;#160; <font size="1">n</font><br />
      x=<font size="3">***931;</font> w<font size="1">i</font>* x<font size="1">i</font><br />
      &amp;#160;&amp;#160; <font size="1">i=1</font><br />
      <br />
      To generate these with uniform spread is not very easy though, and it's probably more useful to keep n=2 and morph from shape to shape rather than mixing all of them together.</p>
