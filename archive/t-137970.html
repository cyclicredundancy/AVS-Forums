<div class="posttext">yes...it is very easy<br />
<br />
x1a=...(insert code here);<br />
y1a=...;<br />
z1a=...;<br />
x2b=...;<br />
y2b=...;<br />
z2b...;<br />
<br />
x1=x1a*p+(1-p)*x1b;<br />
y1=y1a*p+(1-p)*y1b;<br />
z1=z1a*b+(1-p)*z1b;<br />
<br />
p is a value from 0 to 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw...this was in the tips and tricks thread.  you should have searched the forums.  also there is instructions on how to do it with three variables.<br />
<br />
of course, you can also get cool effects if you use seperate variables for p for x, y, and z (i.e. use px, py, pz) this way, you will have much more variation in the SSC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this really wasnt in the tips and tricks thread.. to search for it you would of had to know that it uses linear filtering method to achieve its ends.. [the x=b*pt+c*(1-pt) part]<br />
<br />
But yeah, its reasonably easy as long as you understand how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The general rule is:<br />
<br />
To morph between n shapes, pick weights w1, w2, ..., wn. So that<br />
<br />
n<br />
***931; wi = 1   (and usually 0 &lt; wi &lt; 1)<br />
i=1<br />
<br />
For coordinates xi, yi, zi, you calculate:<br />
<br />
***160;***160; n<br />
x=***931; wi* xi<br />
***160;***160; i=1<br />
<br />
To generate these with uniform spread is not very easy though, and it's probably more useful to keep n=2 and morph from shape to shape rather than mixing all of them together.</div></div><hr />
