<div class="posttext">Hi all... sadly i've been very busy for the past few months, but i am free again (for how long is anyones guess) and i though i'd use my spare time to make a few new presets.The first is a remix of an old one i made (completely different though... see below for a link to the original), the second is new, and the third is a remix of the second. <br />
<br />
Anyway, all comments/reviews/death threats/suggestions/improvements/etc are welcome, and i hope to do more work in the near future :D<br />

<div class="posttext">You probably don't have an archive that supports Rar files</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">why don't you just zip the presets?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have software that supports .rar. I could open the file and see the contents. But it won't let me unzip them. I think the file is screwed. Please put them in a .zip.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="posttext">Fairly n00bish.<br />
A lot of optimization in the code could be fixed.<br />
pi can be acos(-1), put p=acos(-1); in init.  put 256p=p*256; in init.  You can replace all the 3.15159*256 with 256p.<br />
<br />
In DM's, d and r are not used when rectangular coordinates is selected and x and y are not used when rectangular coordinates is disselected.<br />
<br />
There are a LOT of other optimizations that you need too- move as much code as you can out of pixel to init, beat, or frame (in order or prefrence)...of course, you cannot move code from pixel that has i, x, and y (in sscs) or d,x,y,r in DMs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dammit, I had a big thing typed up and then IE crashed.  Basically what mÂ²k said.  Also, don't use division when you can multiply instead(i.e. change r/64 to r*0.015625).<br />
<br />
These presets leave a lot to be desired - learn better SSC and DM coding and try again.  Keep trying though, it takes a while to get it for some people, but you can do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thank you for your replies. <br />
<br />
I tried to do a little optimisation, and i was amazed at the difference in performance. more to come soon :)</div></div><hr />
