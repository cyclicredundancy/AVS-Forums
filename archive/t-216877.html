<div class="posttext">Nice preset denksief√ºrsich! really like it!<br />
Only the grey background could be changed somehow. How about those colors i added in a few seconds:<br />
(see attached file)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S: matt, your &quot;preset&quot; only shows grey and white dots like on a TV-screen without a signal. it is to be feared that people most probably won't like such disfiguring &quot;remixes&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like stripes myself.<br />
<br />
Nice DM, but the background just needs some work and personally i don't think the gray fits here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">cool remix tug! :up:<br />

<div class="posttext">Well i wouldn't call it so much of a remix as just a small edit, if you really look into it you notice i didn't actually do much :)<br />
It just comes to show how great basicly the original was :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th May 2005, 16:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, that's for sure! It has great potential, actually im playing around with it all the time. ;)<br />
<br />
BTW: sometimes a small edit can turn out to be a big gain...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:D Thanks to everyone!<br />
<br />
As I'd mentioned in some of the replies on the link at DA, the colors do suck... and you guys sure won't let me forget it. :p<br />
But that's why it still in the scraps, it needs a lot of work still. It's very rough in this stage. I only submitted it for some feedback on the DM, which I'm real glad to find that everyone likes!<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the remixes, as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Btw. I made a preset with a similiar DM for Finnish Flash 6 (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1546029/). Probably the reason I was so familiar with it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I thought that maybe you could speed it up a bit by using a superscope which also generates the colors.<br />
<br />
I couldn't really get it to help in full screen though.</div></div><hr />
