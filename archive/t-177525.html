			<strong>Buttons in AVS</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		It's questionable if this belongs in the presets subforum or in the AVS forum, but I didn't start this thread only about the preset, but more about the functionality.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have already worked this out, but here's my way of doing this:<br />
<br />
You don't want the button to flip per frame when you hold the mouse button for multiple frames, what would happen if you would simply use button=getkbmouse(3); I solved this by generating a pulse when the mouse-button is pressed.<br />
<br />
This pulse normally would only trigger the button for 1 frame. You want it to switch per pulse. Here's how I solved it all (button is reg02). <br />
<br />
<pre><code><br />
xm=getkbmouse(1);<br />
ym=getkbmouse(2);<br />
rm=getkbmouse(3);<br />
mc=if(below(xm,-.9)&amp;above(xm,-1)&amp;above(ym,.9)&amp;below(ym,1)&amp;rm,1,0);<br />
mcpulse=if(equal(mcold,mcnew),0,if(equal(mcold,0),1,0));<br />
mcold=var;<br />
var=if(equal(mc,0),mcpulse,1);<br />
mcnew=var;<br />
mcswitch=if(mcpulse,bnot(mcswitch),mcswitch);<br />
reg02=mcswitch;<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
Example preset is attached (will most likely be in my new pack). <br />
The button appears when you move the mouse over the left and bottom of the preset ( xpos &lt; -0.9 or ypos &lt; 0.9 ) Click it and the preset changes. Also explained in the comment.

		Your method is waaaaaay too complicated (not to mention such a thing has been posted before).<br />
<br />
Pulse:<br />
<br />
old=new;new=getkbmouse(3);pulse=band(new,bnot(old));<br />
<br />
Then just check the x/y coordinates and and with pulse:<br />
if(band(pulse,...), /* do mouse click */ ,0);

		UnConeD got it. <br />
I am kicking aorund an idea like that for a prest library GUI type fux0red thing, it would be nice if it worked.

		%@#$!!! just when I think I've worked someting out... :mad: <br />
<br />
Nevermind...<br />
<br />
By the way, why is band() faster than &amp; ? Aren't funtions slower than operators in this case (pulse) ? :confused:<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Am I the only one who likes the altered preset or am I the only one? None of my friends seem to like it... :cry:<br />

		Hmm, doesn't &amp; do something else? The explanation on the help is hard to understand for me tho :confused:<br />
<br />
But band would be * too in occasions, band(1,1)=1 and 1*1=1 Just as long as they are numbers and the values are 1 precisely.<br />
Don't know what is the fastest way though :p<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
The altered preset is nicer with low fps, but with high fps it tends to flicker too much.<br />

		band() is boolean AND<br />
&amp; is bitwise AND<br />
<br />
the C representation of band(x, y) should be something like<br />
(((x == 0) || (y==0))? 0 : 1)<br />
<br />
x &amp; y is probably<br />
(double)(((int)x)&amp;((int)y))<br />
<br />
band() is 2 floating point comparisons and a boolean OR,<br />
whereas &amp; is 3 type conversions and a bitwise AND<br />
guess which one is faster ;)

		UnConeD's method has benefits &amp; disadvantages:<br />
<br />
For writing DM it has functionality, but, when I want to code other parts I have same problems.

		Comparing functions with operators in AVS makes no sense: the scripting language is way too high level to be able to decide what goes on on the assembly level.<br />
<br />
Get the WA5 SDK and look in the nseel dir, nseel-cfunc.c. Then come back and discuss speed issues :rolleyes: .
