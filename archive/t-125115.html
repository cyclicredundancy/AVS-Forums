<div class="posttext">I need help with the AVS Window. The Prev Next button does not work.. I have a massive collection of vis. could this be the reason. I hate right clicking then choosing... better to use the prev next button.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if you're using WA3, my first piece of advice is use 2.x (but then half the people in this forum would disagree with me).  then make sure you're using the right prev/next/random button; you can define these in the &quot;Preferences -&gt; Hotkeys/Presets&quot; menu.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nezumix, do you mean the actual buttons below the avs window or the keyboard buttons?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1. Dump Winamp3.<br />
<br />
2. Pick up Winamp2.<br />
<br />
3. Use Y/U keys to cycle through instead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's actually the buttons in the AVS window. it won't work on any skin whatsoever.. Yeah winamp2 doesn't do that but pls. get with the times...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th February 2003, 13:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The times dictate that Winamp2 is better.  Winamp3 has better skinning, but it is 10 times as buggy, and uses up more resources as well.  Plus it doesn't always work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nezumix</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th February 2003, 15:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I agree, Winamp3's improvements that proved beneficial for me was merely superficial, it only gave eye candy.. style over substance. I don't use their powerful features such as the media library b'coz i just use winamp to listen audio and that's it.. <br />
<br />
And I just wanted to cycle through the vis with prev and next button adn that's just what I want 'coz its much practical that way...<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just a bug so I have to wait for the next WA3 release again, whew.. I guess its back to Winamp2. (just for the vis that is)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For those who say Sonique sucks and cling on to WA3 like Ted Kennedy to a MGD, these people (http://www.armory.com/~crisper/Scorch/) would be quite interested in you....<br />
<br />
And nezumix, it's entirely more practical to simply use the keyboard shortcuts if you don't have a skin that'll give you the prev/next buttons on the AVS window.  Even better: get a better skin and stop bitching about it.  Even better: edit the damn skin.<br />
And, of course, there's always, well, not using WA3 in the first place.  It's like using WinXP just cos it's there and it's new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, he said that none of the skins work.  He should have Winamp2 though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hey, i've got another prob. with this one.. the keys DON't EVEN WORK.. hmmm. it's weird.. <br />
<br />
So, i stick with the WA2 solution until then</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I recommend giving your computer a nice format.  This may help solve some of the problems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Winamp3 has many flaws, but its video capabilities make me keep it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I prefer mplayer2 for video playing, it loads a lot faster than winamp3, is heaps more stable, and doesn't have as many bugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Mplayer2 is great...It is (unfortunately?) the only useful thing Microsoft has ever put out - but it's still the fastest out there.<br />
<br />
(Zeven's like me.  He needs a nice fast player to load all his pr0n onto.) :p</div></div><hr />
