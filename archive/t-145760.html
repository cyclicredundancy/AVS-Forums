			<strong>Cubed to death (mhesa back!)</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Well i'll be back next monday and it's thursday now... well anyway just a few days more and im back to school and back to surfing the forums etc. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a cube preset! (whoa... i can hear your sigh of boredom...)<br />
It's very plain (intented), it contains only the scopes, nothing more. And unless someone has better idea than: Blitter feedback effects, swirly dm's, water filter, interleave, mosaic, starfields, fadeout &amp; blur or &quot;d=0.5&quot; rays, im keeping it that way, because i want it to be fast and unless i or you can think about any original effect there is really no need to use the same old effects all over again. Now is there?<br />
<br />
Have Fun.

		That's nice, tugg.  Even with those nicely filled in sides, it still runs fast.

		This looks coool!<br />
<br />
Why dont you add 6 surrounding floating energy flares to each side that emit a flash onto a cubes side just before its lifting up.<br />
<br />
That would be original, would'nt it?

		Very nice!  The scopes in the center of the cube look pretty sweet.  <br />
<br />
It does look kinda plain though, even though I understand what you mean about that....

		That cube has nice sides, I like the shiny look at the lines were the sides meet.
