(This would make up for how awful the 2nd birthday tribute was)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This really comes up in a bad time... When was devarts birthday again? I already have turned down Ches Dragon's collab pack, but damn... i wouldn't want to miss this since i love devart and i spend most of my time there. Even more time than in the forums (sorry fellas, but you're not just that attractive ;))<br />
<br />
So devarts birhtday?<br />
Deadline?<br />
<br />
Maybe i could come up with something if there is plenty of time...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">By the way here's the DeviantART logo traced as a superscope.<br />
<br />
u=i*.544;<br />
f=below(u,.05);px=if(f,-.23,px);py=if(f,u*21-.61,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.05),below(u,.069));px=if(f,-.23-(u-.05)*21,px);py=if(f,.45,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.06899),below(u,.17));s=(u-.069)*31.4;px=if(f,-.61*cos(s),px); py=if(f,.45-pow(abs(sin(s)),.9)*.67,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.1699),below(u,.188));px=if(f,.61-(u-.17)*21,px);py=if(f,.45,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.18799),below(u,.209));px=if(f,.265,px);py=if(f,.45-(u-.188)*21,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.20899),below(u,.219));px=if(f,.265-(u-.209)*21,px); py=if(f,.0-(u-.209)*5,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.21899),below(u,.254));px=if(f,.065,px);py=if(f,.15+(u-.229)*21,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.25399),below(u,.294));px=if(f,.065+(u-.254)*21,px);py=if(f,.67,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.29399),below(u,.430));s=(u-.294)*23;px=if(f,.89*cos(s),px); py=if(f,.67-pow(abs(sin(s)),.9)*1.05,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.42999),below(u,.47));px=if(f,-.89+(u-.430)*21,px);py=if(f,.67,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.4699),below(u,.535));px=if(f,-.05,px);py=if(f,.67-(u-.47)*21,py);<br />
f=band(above(u,.53499),below(u,.546));px=if(f,-.05-(u-.535)*20.1,px); py=if(f,-.695+(u-.535)*9,py);<br />
py=py*.8-.1;<br />
alpha=bnot(bor(band(above(u,.107),below(u,.117)),band(above(u,.3646),below(u,.3737))));<br />
<br />
The resulting points are put into (px,py) in AVS coordinates. 'Alpha' is zero where the lines should be black, and 1 otherwise. Because of this, the scope should be drawn with additive or maximum blending mode.<br />
Depending on the amount of points you use to draw it, you might need to tweak the constants in the alpha line so that the scope's lines stop right at the D.<br />
<br />
If you're running low on variables: u and f are temporary variables and can be replaced by e.g. red,green,blue... If you don't need i elsewhere, you can even replace u by i (provided you keep the first rescaling line i=i*.544)<br />
<br />
I'm going to make an intro preset with this, because I don't have time to make a full on DevArt tribute... if no-one minds, this could be the pack's intro preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Jack: just make a cool preset... I'm sure you'll come up with something neat if you want to :)<br />
<br />
Btw here is my suggestion for the Intro. The scope is a 3D version of the one above, with connecting lines plus an optimized version of the beam effect from Whacko AVS III. Looks pretty rad :).<br />
<br />
I also added a credits scroller which will include everyone's name, and optionally some extra blabber.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other preset is my submission for the tribute pack. I don't have much time to make a special preset just for the pack, so I took the hairy blobscope which I posted a while ago to demonstrate how to calculate normals. It's still pretty neat, and well Atero always said I should publish it as a decent preset :).<br />
<br />
Once this is published on DevART, everyone should immediately +fav it, so it will get noticed, get featured and give AVS a much needed PR boost :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm...<br />
<br />
Just wondering how many of you guys even are deviantart.com members and submit on the site? Im not saying it should be a criterion to participate on the pack, but im just wondering why are you willing to join into a tribute for site you don't even use? :weird:</div></div><hr />

maybe horse-fly releases a new version of his fella preset for the pack?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">UnConeD that is amazing.  I was going to do about the same thing(without the volumetric lighting), but it looks like you beat me to it.  The DA logo doesn't move very fast, so you may want to speed it up a slight bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yathosho: Well since most people here will be working on the presets, why not post them too? It's supposed to be a collaborative effort anyway, and that way we can advise eachother on how to improve presets...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's not like they *have* to be exclusive.  If you want to release one in one of your packs, go ahead...just not before the tribute pack.<br />
BTW, I do think it should just be people who use AND post on devART...<br />
<br />
Very cool intro, UnConeD.  It's extremely slow, tho...I think that scope can just be somewhere from n=600-900 meself :) And there's the part where sometimes it rotates just a little to far, making the beam effect look really wierd....</div></div><hr />

so be it.... expect it whenever... i still have p8 and multi filter to finish. along with a 3d game engine that i have been working on for the past month or so, plus my ogl winamp visualisation plus my geforce fx demo... and yes i *DO* have a big fat juicy GeForce FX 5800.. how much did I pay for it? Here's a hint - the correct answer will always be less than or equal to the absolute value of your guess.<br />
<br />
damn why do i always take on way to much shit in my spare time. sorry guys but avs has taken a bit of a backseat for me lately.<br />

<div class="posttext">Spectral Milkshake - It's alright, but it's a bit repetitive and the screen nearly goes completely white a couple of times.<br />

<div class="posttext">What about this one? And in Electric, to get circles instead of horizontal lines, go to the movement inside the 2nd Effect List and disable the &quot;Rect. coords&quot; box. If you don't like that either, just disable the 2nd Effect List. You get rid of the lines and get some FPS :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ATI Radeon 9700 pro only outperforms the GeForce FX 5800 when 4xFSAA is enabled, otherwise the GeForce FX 5800 is the faster card. Also the GeForce FX can manipulate 128-bit colors and is much faster overall when the hardware accelerated functions are used.</div></div><hr />

And now i understand that it wasnt so good idea:<br />
<br />
1. its booring<br />
2. its slow<br />
3. im not good enough to make it move cool (cant u see i need help)<br />
4. im not good enough to make it do something cool<br />
5. it looks uncool (:weird: :P)<br />
6. its unreadable (well its readable but... well yea... ull see..)<br />
<br />
and i was too lazy to make the D and R petter<br />
i did this thing in one day and now i am not planning to make the code faster today <br />
<br />
anyways, what do you think of it?<br />
plz, give me some ideas what to do with it...<br />

<div class="posttext">Moves a bit too fast on my computer to be readable.  I would also have it start out looking at the front of it, not the side.  Like raz said, it needs some effects, which should be enough to slow it down so that it is readable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">...but to make it start looking front of it i need to recode all of it... and even the A (ouch!!)<br />
I'll see what will i do with the effects...<br />
I'll brobably make the ART bigger and correct the D and R...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th March 2003, 21:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You won't need to recode all of it.  Just change out the x, y, and z variables.  Actually, you only need to switch the x and z variables.  Shouldn't be too difficult.</div></div><hr />

skupers: dreaming of that green is great - not too sure about untitleda.<br />
<br />
and i'd also like to say that these presets don't have to be restrained to things having to do with DA, but it'd be nice if they wer - color schemes count too :)<br />
so far it's:<br />

<div class="posttext">- Fix aspect ratio (why doesn't anyone do this, it makes 3D scopes look like crap :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
- Why do the arcs have a zigzag filling but straight lines don't? Inconsistency is generally a bad thing. Also, the bottom part of the D's arc and the upper part of the R's arc don't meet the end correctly.<br />
<br />
- The beginning/end of the arcs is missing the connection between the front- and backprofile of the letters<br />
<br />
Anyway you still need to make a preset out of this :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">-you mean<br />
x=x3/(z3/2+1+dst);<br />
y=y3/(z3/2+1+dst);<br />
 must be <br />
x=x3/(z3+2+dst); (or something like this)<br />
y=y3/(z3+2+dst);<br />
 <br />
-at first i wanted to make the no_zigzag but the zigzag was easier, but ill make the zigzag to straight lines and i sayd before and ill say it again: ill make the D and R better<br />
<br />
-what da?<br />
<br />
thanks for help<br />
Ill do it! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th March 2003, 19:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Fixing the aspect ratio means that you make your scope look right even if you look at it in a rectangular window. Otherwise your scopes will look squished, circles will be ellipses and rotation will look weird.<br />
<br />
You need to multiply x by h/w or y by w/h. Or you could use min(h/w, 1) and min(w/h, 1) and multiply both x and y, or use max.<br />
<br />
Depends on how you want to fix it (always stretch x, always stretch y, stretch smallest, squish largest).<br />
<br />
Check attachment for an explanation about the other thing :).</div></div><hr />

I like it a lot to. I have been trying to write simple and tight code to improve on my programing skils. This preset includes the tightest  mosaic and solid scope code I can write at this time (any input on how to make it even better is grately apreciated). The only part that sucksorZ is that the scope and the (beautiful:)) squares can't be rotated:(.</div></div><hr />

Stickies are for important stuff/short term stuff IMHO.<br />
<br />
Still don't think these 2 'tribute' threads are really needed. Maybe it is also beacuse I hate DA site is there a slower site on the Internet.<br />

BTW it is bad form to ask one mod and then ask another. It is like a 5 year old asking his dad for a special treat and when he says no he goes running to his mum.</div></div><hr />

The two things I'd request from EVERYONE is that 1) you start posting comments in their presets for this tribute, and that you post something for a comment on the intro; and 2) you keep your presets DA related.<br />
<br />
Now, anyone that's posted anything, please please PLEASE don't get me wrong when I say this.  The only really good presets I've seen for the pack that are DA related are Nic01's probe (assuming he gets it fixed, of course), FSK's Squared remix, HF's Dreaming of That Green, and UnConeD's intro (I'd say my Cubism remix as well but nobody's commented on it yet).  I have (or at least I think I have) seen all of the presets in this post.  That's 4 (or 5) presets total so far.  Keep making them!  And if you posted and I didn't mention you above...make more!  NAYAH BITCH.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I believe he'll pick the best of yours if you have more than 3 - Except if the extra presets are just so good and he can't quite leave them out...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'll do a couple of presets if you want me to but i don't use deviantart that much except for downloading wallpapers and avs packs. A few people said that it should just be people who regularly post comments and release things so i don't think i should get involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
????? which preset is this?  i have a devart fella dancer, and that is the only devart related preset i have.  <br />
<br />
TO EVERYONE:::  Personally, i don't mind if you remix any of my presets, as long i get some credit in the comment, and that the remixer also get credit (also in the comment).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow, that is a REALLY cool effect.  but it's not very dynamic...i know you can do more with this :) also...it seems like your filtering could be a lot faster if you did it with a convolution filter or something...but maybe it's just me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought the original colors were... um... icky (don't hurt me! ;) ).  Added some color maps for it to rotate through.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  This is the first preset I've modified :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Wiser87</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd May 2003, 03:49</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually, use this one instead... fixed one of the colors that looked too similar to one of the other color maps and added another one...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">who said the colors of the preset have to be like the (very ugly!) colors of devart?? keep your fingers out of it, and if you play around with it, put your name in the comment and the filename (remixed by.. ).<br />
<br />
btw: remove the multiplier (in *my* preset) and you got your ugly devart colors. :D <br />
<br />
wiser: your version looks like the standard theme of deskmod.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">actually, it'd be better to include only that preset from me in the pack, the others ones i sent are kinda crappy, i think...<br />
<br />
and don't bitch at me for not using the edit button, cause the other post was made hours ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, I'm making a deadline - two weeks from now, August 1st.  That means GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASSES AND START AVSING.  Tomorrow I'll see if I can get some time to go through everything and get a list compiled, along with some requests on optimizations, fixes, addons, etc. (i.e. I still want yathosho to fix his preset to make it more dynamic).  EVERYONE NEEDS TO COMMENT ON THEIR PRESETS.  IF YOU DO NOT YOUR PRESET WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED.<br />
<br />
NOW GET TO WORK :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Due to the extreme and unadulterated laziness of you guys, we've got 13 presets (kind of) and something like 2 comments (kind of).  I've washed my hands in this project.  Someone else can pick it up if they want.<br />
<br />
I zipped up all the presets but the file is too big for the forums, so anyone who wants to put this out will have to look for them themselves.</div></div><hr />
