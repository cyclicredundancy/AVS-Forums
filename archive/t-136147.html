<div class="posttext">Come check my AVS Preset. It is kinda good, flying in the air and all. Only thing that I suspect is someone nice enough to take a look at it and rate it. Or just email me about it, don't care. I don't even mind if it is a harsh comment, doesn't matter. Only thing I hope to see on this thread is helpful hints in making it better. If you want to give it a comment, please rate it and give a comment like that. Thank you, peace out.<br />

<div class="posttext">Kinda like it, but hell, kinda did a bit different at the spiral. I was interested in the spiral so, I kinda used some few things and put that together. Thanks anyway. I don't do much of anything now, mainly most of my skins and avs's was deleted. There is one pack though, Death Speaks AVS Pack that is totally my ideal and haven't been done before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">... If you want to doesn't matter... My Death Speaks AVS Pack as more downloads anyway... So I might just delete Mighty Spiral AVS if I wanted too. I only keep the good ones. When I mean that, I don't joke.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You fail to see the point.  Ripping is a mortal sin, and that is *not* an understatement.  You act like it's a joke.<br />

<div class="posttext">No... I know it ain't a joke. Plus, if my mom's computer wasn't on the brink of crashing, I would get the old one off there and send it here... Think about it, this isn't my computer, it is my older brothers, thus I have to ask permission first to download anything, especially winamp!!! Do you understand me...! I would have credited the person. Hell if you want to change it without the actual file, go on a head. I don't care.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, someone did change it... Well the description ain't mine!! I also gave credit to the person who made the spiral!!</div></div><hr />
