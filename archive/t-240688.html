      i'm writing a avs review guide using word 2000 and it's still in the first phase of production however this review guide will only be for modern avs presets only as i'm not going to review old avs packs or avs artists such as avsociety who stopped making avs packs after avsociety volume 5 however if any body wants me to review them then please feel free to tell me but i might not review them anyway</p>

      <p class="post-content">What do you mean by a review guide? I'm a bit confused by this.<br />
      <br />
      And, please, try to space the reply out. It's much easier to read, as well, with punctuation. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">So, you want to make a what, list of reviews for all packs that are relevant iyo ?<br />
      <br />
      Well, good luck. If you have the will to do it, and don't usually have the ballistic approach to punctuation you showed in this post, it miiight be interesting.</p>

      </blockquote>Ballistic? Ballistic is usually employed as an adjective to describe something moving without an applied external force:<br />
      <br />
      "Once fired, the cannonball follows a ballistic trajectory."<br />
      "A ballistic missile spends most of its flight in free-fall."<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps you meant something else?

      </blockquote>That must be some sort of crazy slang or ethnic variation, I seriously doubt you would find it in a dictionary. "Ballistic" is derived from "Ballista" hence the projectile association... I dont know how you get to "choppy", "excited" and "angry" from there

      I would've understood it like "he shot 'em randomly all over the place" [the dots that is], but that wouldn't apply to this post<br />

      Anyway @shodan if you could review the old ones though this could be evolving into sth like "The Ultimate Guide To The Best Packs Eva!"</p>

      </blockquote>I suppose it may be somewhat of an informal idiom, but at <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ballistic" target="_blank">Dictionary.com</a>, in <a href="http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;va=ballistic" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>, and in <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=92414&amp;dict=CALD" target="_blank">Cambridge</a>, ballistic is listed as an adjective of such. :)

      </blockquote>"somewhat of an informal idiom", I dont think there is any "somewhat" about it, they all cite that usage to be either informal or idiomatic And none of them even alude to "choppy" or "excited".

      <p class="post-content">That phrase is used from time to time by Terry Pratchett in his books to describe random use of punctuation in, for example, letters.<br />
      <br />
      Admittedly, I didn't use it for the best effect, but it could apply in a way. Or not.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think that the use of ballistic like that is very modern slang. It might be 'officially' part of American English, but its not correct in English English :p<br />
      <br />
      It probably comes from analogy with ballistic missles, which have been popularised as terrible weapons. e.g. "This guy went ballistic", could be interpreted as: "This guy went and became like a ballistic missile", and the meaning remains intact.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: I just looked at one of your links to make sure I wasn't totally wrong :p<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=go%20ballistic" target="_blank">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=go%20ballistic</a><br />
      <br />
      "<b>go ballistic</b><br />
      <br />
      Become extremely upset or angry, as in Dad will go ballistic when he sees you dented the new car. This expression, a variation on go berserk, originally alluded to a guided missile going out of control. [Slang; mid-1980s]"<br />
      <br />
      Note their terrible grammar btw :)</p>

      what do you suppose the essence of language is? (hint: its not grammer or vocabulary)</p>
