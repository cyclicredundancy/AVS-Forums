<div class="posttext">Hi, people!<br />
<br />
I want to discover your opinion about the Preset in the attachment :)<br />
It's a new of my fresh Pak, which comes soon. I know, now you asking you, &quot;who is this&quot;. I Have published some paks - of course a little bit basic ... but its not easy, when you speak another language and understand nothing in this AVS-editor!<br />
Know anybody a little AVS tutorial in german :( ?<br />
<br />
And look in my signature and please satisfy my wish: rate LIQUID-FIRE!<br />
(do it for me ;) )<br />
<br />
BYE, your Bekay</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi, flattmat!<br />
<br />
I didn't steal your name, you didn't steal my name. When I had created my first presets of this pack, I had named one of these &quot;Liquid Fire&quot; - it was a pretty fine preset and I decided to make it to the main-preset and so the pack get the name &quot;Liquid Fire&quot; (BY THAT TIME I REALLY DIDNT KNOW, THAT SOMEBODY OHTER HAD THIS IDEA BEFORE ME)... so I wanted to upload the Pack ...... SHOCK :eek: <br />
This name was gave away - I was sad, because I was so proud of my creation and so I call my Pack &quot;Liquid-Fire&quot;. So Im sorry, when I hurt you. It was a good idea, and you had the Idea and I, too.<br />
<br />
And when you dont believe me, look at the presets of the Pack; these I didnt steal...<br />
<br />
And that is no fairy tale, I'm honest.<br />
Im Sorry :( , Bekay</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, shoulda stuck a :p on the end of that reply.  Funny.  Liquid Fire Preset Pack is named after my &quot;Liquid Fire&quot; preset.  What coincidences occur. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good preset, since orange is such a great colour. The only thing I say is make some more.. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's kinda cool, maybe it should be a bit brighter?<br />
Just continue on this line dude, in a few months you'll be a pro =)<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I like your preset, create some more and make a nice psychedelic package out of them...<br />
<br />
Here's something for you. The &quot;.bmp&quot; needs to be in the &quot;\winamp\plugins\avs&quot;-directory, quite important, as the preset crashes winamp if it doesn't find the image (under Win2000 that is...).<br />
And tell me if you like mine...<br />

<div class="posttext">Hi, Ravefluid!<br />
<br />
Cool Preset... a little bit like Matrix - pretty technical style! :) <br />
<br />
To Little Buddy: THX for the compliment;) !<br />
<br />
Bye, your Bekay</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey! Do you know, what I noticed: That this Preset (Trip of your Life) is really ugly... Do you feel sometimes the same as me:( <br />
   ----&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
You create a cool preset - You think it's amazing - You hope, you become successful with this brand-new style - then the next day you you gaze at the preset ... and you find it nasty!!!<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have to witness this...<br />
<br />
Do you made the same experiences???:confused: <br />
<br />
I hope, I didnt bore you.... Bye, your Bekay</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi, People, I want to make propaganda for my new preset pack. Though it isn't published, but you can download my old Pack (L i q u i d - f i r e (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=71911)), too ;) <br />
<br />
I want to ask you, how you find my artwork to my new &quot;LIQUID-DRUGS AVS&quot;:<br />

<br />
Cool or not cool???<br />
<br />
Your Opinion is welcome!!!!<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It looks neat!<br />
How'd you do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Bekay</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th October 2001, 21:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh, that wasn't so difficult;) <br />
<br />
First I made some sreenshots of my new Presets - of these I picked up the best - and then I put all together in &quot;Ulead Photo Impact 6.0&quot; ... and I'm not a tracer or something, in truth I can't paint very well.... but I try to work hard to reach good results. It must look professional, then I'm satisfied :rolleyes:<br />
<br />

PS: your graphic in the signature looks just great!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think it's a bit simple though, but I like the text effect.<br />
Try working a bit more on blending the images together,<br />
If you're working with layers, then just set the layer of the four small parts to &quot;screen&quot; or something, that should get rid of the black parts around it, and it would also blend the images together a bit more ;)<br />
And a mirrored(symmetrical) image in the middle looks a bit boring, try using something with a little more light and speed in it, maybe the top right one? :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Woahhh... You changed the pic! I think it looks sooo much better! I wonder how you do it...Look at mine, from the trial version of ulead..<br />
Of course its bad, but I dont know how to do everything yet. And I just whipped this up from scratch..<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you for the compliment, Nrein3000!<br />
<br />
It looks really better ... try to play around with the merge modes of certain objects! I had done the same, so you can make some beautiful effects.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think it's a sort of false advertising to put insanely edited pictures as your screenshots. Just glue together some screenshots of your presets and put a spiffy text label on it, nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Bekay</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th November 2001, 21:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">...mmmh... yes you are right, only screenshots are better, BUT I have used only Screenshots (I'm honest) - with the difficulty I have merged them all together;) !!!<br />
<br />
But I will be honest with you: For somebody like you, UnConed, It's no problem to use only screens, because your presets are really ART, and so the Screenshots of your presets are ART, too, and look just beautiful... but for somebody, who makes easier presets than you, it's very complicated to get downloads ... and so you try to make a pretty cool Artwork for yor Presetpack to attract the viewers!!!<br />
<br />
I hope you can understand this :rolleyes: <br />
