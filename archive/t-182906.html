      i remember winamp.com staff promising, that the plugins from the former "components" (winamp3 plugins) section would get merged into the existing database..<br />
      <br />
      that was almost 6 months ago. will it ever happen?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, i was thinking of the many avs packs submitted to it. not everybody used the classic winamp page, many received reviews or even features they might want to keep. though it would be sad losing them, i'd prefer a word from nullsoft. if they are incapable merging the components into the plugins section, i'd start the painful procedure and resubmit everything :(<br />
      <br />
      however, i am hoping that authors show in this post, that they favor a merger.</p>
