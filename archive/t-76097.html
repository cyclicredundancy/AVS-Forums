      These are some of my favorite presets-mainly because I liked the way the colors or the overall effect turned out. What do you think?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>my opinion</strong><br />
      I think the colors in your visualizations need work. Most seem to be random, bright, and scattered. Not that it's necessarily bad thing; it looks good in chaz 6.5.5 and even more so with underwater fireworks (which I believe to be your best-looking one). But, I'd recommend trying to change the render mode to 50/50 blend or to use less color clips.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I'd reccomened making sure of the order of your renders and trans effects in the list. Like in "c much better laser-like effect 3" (odd name, like most of yours), the blur effect is near the top, but if you move it to the bottom, it blurs the superscope, as to make it look less like pixels, but without being slower.<br />
      <br />
      I'd like to see your bright ideas (haha, I'm so punny), but the need work at the moment.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thanks.</strong><br />
      Thanks for your opinion. I will work on that for next time. I'm really glad to hear that someone else thought underwater fireworks was cool. It's kind of weird at first-especially for me. I was just messing around in AVS after school one day, and I really like the effect of how the colors change, so I decided to keep it.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>he he</strong><br />
      :) I just realized how weird it might seem to someone seing those names of my files. Well, I was doing AVS for a math project with another student, and I ended up making most of the presets, but he learned a lot, and teaching it to someone helped me gain a better understanding. Anyway, to make it not so apparent who did what, I changed his plugins to his first initial, A - and all of my presets had the prefix c. The name that followed them was just a description so I could know what the preset was like. I'll work on better names for next set.<br />

      :D<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>any other opinions?</strong><br />
      I'm just posting this message to hopefully get some more ideas on how to improve my presets.<br />
