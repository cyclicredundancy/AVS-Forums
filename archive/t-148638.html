      Email from Justin i recieved today.. hot off the press<br />
      Here is the nitty gritty of it:<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        <b><font color="red">Does Nullsoft have anything at all planned for AVS?</font></b><br />
        We don't really have anything concrete planned at this point, but with the release of Winamp 5 we should be continuing development. mig is going to compile a list of things for us to do, based on his own wishes and what he hears from the community. And I'll try to get some of it done when I can.<br />
        <br />
        <b><font color="red">Is open source AVS by any means possible?</font></b><br />
        At this point I wouldn't hold my breath. :/ It's tough to get a lot of things done in the current environment. We are working on changing this, but I really don't know what will happen.<br />
        <br />
        <b><font color="red">Are AOL trying to mute our passions?</font></b><br />
        Heh I don't think they are intentionally trying to, but alas their interests and yours are probably not completely aligned.<br />
        <br />
        <b><font color="red">Do you in particular have anything planned in the vis world?</font></b><br />
        Heh not so much. At this point my dev efforts are so spread out (basically all Winamp related development at this point is done by me and francis and christophe), that for me to update AVS some would be a lot. heh.

        The whole mail seems to explain everything pretty well to me - '(basically all Winamp related development at this point is done by me and francis and christophe)', sounds like an overstretched team for a project of this magnitude. I also had this strange idea that nullsoft were.. well.. more than three people. With such a small development team it seems excusable that Winamp 3 was so buggy and unstable and stuff. If you guys are out there listening or watching.. or whatever the hell you want to call it, please god don't rush Winamp 5 to meet some timetable or some burning desire to get it out.. make it perfect, even if it takes a year or two or more... I'd rather have a stable, brilliant 'work of art' piece of software after a veritable eternity of wait than a Frankenstein's monster 'cut and paste' hybrid of Winamps 2 and 3.:)<br />
        <br />
        Well... I hope that we get at least one of 'global variables', 'arrays' or 'bigger variable limit' since these are the things that restrict me the most.<br />
        <br />
        Render/OpenGL would be better.. but I won't hold my breath. :p<br />
        <br />
        Looks like I'm never going to get to touch the AVS source. :(

        I think it's just good that they do seem to at least acknowledge our benevolent existence :). 3 people working? That seems, kinda, stupid, must be budget cuts, or something. :rolleyes:</p>
