      <p class="post-content">The others have a weak FPS (framerate) except the number 2.<br />
      Try removing useless things in your preset to gain back the FPS.<br />

      It looks much more nicer then the other one but the fps droped a lot.You need to find somthing else for the render part beacause it uses to much fps and your preset is to slow.
