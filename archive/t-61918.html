      <p class="post-content"><strong>Spectral Lake Clone</strong><br />
      One of my favorite plugins has always been Spectral Lake, it's simple but just great to look at. If you don't know what it is you should be able to find it on winamp.com somewhere, but basically it just a basic spectral analyzer over a picture that is reflected over the x axis. It looks like it's on water because the bottom half waves.<br />
      <br />
      I have the basic setup done, but it doesn't look as good as I'd like and doesn't have the waving thing. I think this would be best accomplished with dynamic movement but I don't really have a clue how to do it. Plus I would like to 1 up Spectral Lake by making the waves go with the music. I'm digging through some AVS tutorials and this message board for help, but I'm still kind of a beginner with AVS. Any help or ideas would be aprreciated.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached my preset file that works with "island.bmp" in the AVS folder.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just whipped this up quickly. Any good?<br />
      I haven't seen this spectral lake plugin, so I don't know what you're trying to achieve, but this is my best guess.</p>

      That's pretty good although I had to add in a picture before I saw anything. Then I just pulled you're dyn. movement into my preset and it looks pretty good, but I need to make only the bottom half wave while the top half stays normal.<br />
      <br />
      Also I couldn't find Spectral Lake on winamp.com so I tried to attach it, but it was too big, maybe I should just submit it although it seems like the author should do that. Keep in mind this plugin is at least 2 years old.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The dm on its own won't leave the top alone. I used a buffer save/restore to keep the top half normal. I don't see why you needed to add a picture. The superscope appears on the first beat it hears.</p>

      For some reason it wasn't working right because I'm using the line input and I think it was having a beat problem, but when I hit stop and play it started working. Not bad, but I still gotta work out how to get it exactly the way I want. I've attached a screen capture from spectral lake, maybe that will help.</p>
