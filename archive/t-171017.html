      <p class="post-content"><strong>Random preset post.</strong><br />
      Just wanted to share a random preset.. just to show that J10 is still being worked on.. although not much since I'm pretty busy these days.<br />
      <br />
      For those with more powerful computers (and therefore higher resolutions) you can adjust the line number of each scope by increasing n and increasing x in r1=x*$pi*i; (the first point line of code in the ssc) proportionally.<br />
      eg:<br />
      <br />
      init:n=1000; point:r1=100*$pi*i;...<br />
      <br />
      becomes<br />
      <br />
      init:n=2000; point:r1=200*$pi*i;...<br />
      <br />
      when you want to double the number of lines drawn.<br />
      <br />
      Enjoy.<br />

      Opinions/suggestions/remixes welcome.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ooo very nice SSC's. Good work with the back to front rendering. Are the rotations of each ring dependent on any of the surrouding rings? Could you add a little tint of the background color to the shapes at all? I think that would pull the shape and the background together a bit more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The object is great, but the sound response is really bad; it just sort of floats there, oblivious to the music.<br />
      The outer ring seems to constantly say "hmm maybe I'll move... nah that's too much effort". Shiny presets with spinny parts need to dance around and tease you, y'know ;). Your camera codes need to be much more complicated than just simple cosines.<br />
      <br />
      I think it would be much better if you had the object move around smoothly, and had the rings spinning with smooth changing speeds (with some sort of inertia). Perhaps try to find something to fill up the emptyness around it.<br />
      <br />
      Heck, it would rule if you could have some sort of ghostly trails around when the rings spin fast, but I'm not sure if that's easily doable.</p>

      Funnily after some chat with montana on #finnish-flash I added a dynamic background colour tint to the 'envmap'. Also all of the rings rotations are independant but there is also a global rotation like effect resulting from the camera movement which may give this impression. The sphere is 'static'.<br />
      <br />
      UCD:<br />
      Thanks for the tips. I've been thinking of adding trails by drawing a really 'fussy' low detail versions of each ring 'behind' the entire object... which would create an effect without ruining the '3D occlusion effects'. So it might be possible.. but probably at the cost of fps.<br />
      <br />
      I'm gonna play with the camera later.. the only problem is that I can't make movements that pass too near to the object and so emptyness is quite tricky to avoid and also limits the camera movement range somewhat. I might change the rotation system to quaternions so that I can do some smoother movements without it going crazy at the 'poles'.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I'll post another version maybe later tonight with some new tings.</p>
