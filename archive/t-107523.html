Countless hours, Countless pacing, but Countless <i>dedication</i>.<br />
<br />
I finally finished it, 11 presets for your rods and cones to devour.  Some of them are excellently done, some are just 5-minute slap jobs.<br />
<br />
Feel free to flame them, Feel free to Mix them, Feel free to complement them.<br />
<br />
Everything is in the zip.  Just tell it where to extract it.

		Sorry to say this, but I don't feel that any of these presets are really original...<br />

		You squashed the first all important semi-colon in my superscope code 'n=8<b>;</b>' :(<br />
<br />
I have to agree with atero about the lack of orginality. Anyone can (and everyone has) just stringed together the predefined effects in numorous ways to produce a load of really average effects, and using APEs like metaballs is pretty lame too.<br />
<br />
At least you have started to make some more 'unique' things though, i.e. the custom scopes and movements. They are what AVS is all about, not presets with three moving particles and two waters and a fadeout...<br />
<br />
Keep making them! You'll get there eventually.
