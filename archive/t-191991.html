<div class="posttext">and my second pack:<br />
(would be good to post more than one attachment at a time)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I haven't gone through all of the second pack yet, but my favorite out of them is Hallucinogenic. In the third pack I like Candy Stripe, it has really good texturing to it. Almost like it was drawn with chalk, not like other stuff you see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Some nice presets.  Nothing too complicated, but its good to see you're keeping with it.  I'm glad that you cut down the final release to just 10 presets, 40's a bit much &amp; gets boring looking through all of them.<br />
<br />
Good colors, &amp; great FPS.  I like 'em fast, &amp; that's definately working for you.  I like your design on most of these.<br />
<br />
You should keep playing around with effects &amp; try to find some better ways of music sensitivity.  Some of these just didn't feel too dynamic with some fun music.<br />
<br />
But a good effort &amp; I'm sure there will be plenty more good stuff in the works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Cool, thanks for your input. Any tips on how to make better music responsive stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th September 2004, 10:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, i've already started V4 - a total of 1 preset, but it rocks, check it out:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th September 2004, 10:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I might be doing something wrong, but I'm not seeing anything. Also, is there supposed to be an 'Unknown Render Object' after the comment, or am I missing an APE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th September 2004, 13:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">PictureII.ape perhaps?:<br />
or just try reloading the preset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th September 2004, 10:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well here's the final version of the first preset in V4 (there are four in total now). What do you think? And can i please get a few more replies this time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th September 2004, 13:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Very awesome dm. Really good job. A+:D<br />
The only thing I have to say is that the getspec could be a tweaked around a bit. If you want try this and see if it still looks good and reacts to the music.<br />
<br />
<br />
beat:<br />
// ... stuff<br />
c1=getspec(0.001,0.99,0)*1.5;  // change these two<br />
c2=getspec(0.41,0.89,0)*2.5<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow that's what I did, because in a certain song the dm zooms out way too much, and doesn't look nice. It does it when there is a steady dropoff of a high frequency sound. Besides that it's pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th September 2004, 16:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sweet thanks man!, I tried your code change and it works a little better for some songs, but some others it didn't look at all like it should. I think i'll just stop it from zooming out too  much. As you might be able to tell, i'm not that good with getosc &amp; getspec, but all that should change now, because i just made the coolest preset ever! :</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 08:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright, I changed some things around here. There's a few things that doesn't change at all, like the blue box, the two back squares, and the black vertical lines for the sliders. Since they don't change calculating them every frame is a waste.<br />
<br />
So what I did is this:<br />
<br />
 made a new effect list at the very top and put the things that wouldn't change in it.<br />
 added a buffer save at the end of the effect list and a buffer replace right after it.<br />
 changed the input and output blending both to ignore.  disabled the effect list and enabled the evaluation override, then put &quot;enabled=1&quot; in the init section (this just makes the effect list enabled for the first frame only).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, after the first frame it just has to read the buffer to get all that stuff, instead of calculating it again every frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 08:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Make no difference to the frame rate (for me anyway), but thanks anyway, i'll keep you changes, although the preset's not quit finished, so i could need your help again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 08:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, with your processing speeds!:mad: :p <br />
<br />
/jk :)<br />
<br />
It does make a difference on my shitty celeron. Now i know why they say you shouldn't put food in a computer, because celerey sucks! Plus I have a damn integrated video card (it's stuck on the fucking motherboard, what good is that?) that doesn't do shit either.<br />
<br />
And I'd be glad to help you out if you need it, it helps me get better in the process, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">anyway, what do you think, do you like it or not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 10:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">What is it, a radio? It looks alright. Probably could use a little more coloring I think (it's kind of monotone right now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 12:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">it's supposed to be a dj's mixing deck, with the vinyls going around...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 12:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That was my second guess, because the name is Mr. DJ. I guess seeing it from the top view threw me off. I like it. So how the pack coming along?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 14:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that's the 5th out of 10 - so halfway there :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th September 2004, 16:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">make that 6/10 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can do more interesting stuff with really not that much more difficult stuff:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th September 2004, 03:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah well i'm still learning - thanks for your help though, i like the look of my preset more anyway. Ichanged that ssc to a texer 2 and now i'm getting a few more fps.</div></div><hr />
