      <p class="post-content">[offtopic]That reminds me, when I use the u&amp;y keys to switch presets AVS stops for a couple of seconds (it has stopped even for 10 seconds at times) and then switches to the preset, when i used to run AVS on Win98 it didn't stop to "think" at all and the switch would be instantaneous. I wonder what's up with that :weird:<br />

      But seriously ... 3 topics locked ... after god knows how long and with insominous names!!! this is ludicricely fucked up in so many ways its not very funny and I'm becoming very confused in whether to post here or not, nor whether its the AVS artists or some dickwads, I think after the topic named "Visualizations from windows media player!" should be automatically locked, I was going to post a new topic but i thought that a reply to a crap thread would be more appropiate than wasting more space than that has already been wasted, and also a storm stopped me :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's a little annoying, I'd agree WotL. But what can we do about it to make it better???<br />
      <br />
      As we can't do sth about noobs, they will always be there, we have to deal with them. So:<br />
      <br />
      First, I'd suggest a big flashing red sign/link the first three times somebody enters the forums, displaying:<br />
      <br />
      <font size="3">Before YOU post anything use the <u>SEARCH-Function</u></font><br />
      <br />
      or sth like this, because I didn't see the link at the first time, lined up with the the other red links above as it is.<br />
      <br />
      [flowerpowermode]<br />
      Second, I think some of us [I don't exclude myself in that] could be friendlier - at least a little - to noobs.<br />

      <p class="post-content">AVS forums is quite the hostile place, for starters we could be more nicer to new people, but that isn't always so easy.<br />
      <br />
      Personally i just can't stand people who make the X question the Nth time or people who can't even explain what it is that they want or people who are just in the wrong goddamn place in the beginning with...<br />
      What can i say, im easily annoyed, and when i get annoyed i tend to open my mouth rather than just shut up and ignore it (which would be the decent and best thing to do), that's just me.<br />
      <br />
      I could ignore idiots and n00bs and idiotn00bs, but i choose not to, i'll rather make a rant or a sarcastic comment or whatnot, than let the rage build up on me and then one day just explode and do something rash.<br />
      <br />
      AVS forums is my steam valve sort of :)<br />
      Pity for the new people though.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>AVS forums is quite the hostile place, for starters we could be more nicer to new people, but that isn't always so easy.</b>[/QUOTE]<br />
      <br />
      It is difficult sometimes to be nice and some in recent times have been complete idiots and being civil is more difficult.<br />
      <br />
      But what really was all that wrong with this/nils99's thread.<br />
      <br />
      True the question has been asked before in a roundabout way.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe you should look at the way the threads are responded to in Winamp Technical support where if anything you get more newbies asking more foolish questions.<br />
      <br />
      The general reaction there is one of support and welcoming even in the face of stupidity and sometimes crazy viewpoints.<br />
      <br />
      Simply ignore the threads if they are too much.<br />
      <br />
      Sometimes in newbies defence there is some aggression here towards them.<br />
      <br />
      We are going to get them here it is the new breed of people taht use the Internet now.<br />
      <br />
      It used to be people were glad of help they would try and find out themselves answers now people just ask without looking and more often then not demand answers.<br />
      <br />
      Ignoring is not easy especially when it is community that you have spend sucha long time building and the want/need to make it stronger with new useful members and stop people leaving.<br />
      <br />
      But try and give it a go. :-)<br />
      <br />
      I know I don't come here much. I pop in every so often to check what is happening but if there is a real problem thread you can use the 'report to moderator' link and all the mods of this forum will get an email and we can take any action if needed.<br />
      <br />
      Hope it helps</p>

      <p class="post-content">Some of my random thoughts on what is or has been happening recently..<br />
      <br />
      Often a thread gets started by a newb who's asking for a simple thing, not knowing if that function exists to begin with. For example we'll take switching presets per song.<br />
      The first reply then is in the line of "search + angry emote" , leaving the question unanswered. Bashing the noob for it is good IMO, but only <b>after</b> the original question has been answered.<br />
      <br />
      The next post will be about "how it could be done, <i>theoretically</i>", complete with ASM code and all if possible. The person who started the thread isn't interested in this. Again, discussing how it could be done is good, or better: great, but only <b>after</b> the question has been answered (and if there is any chance that the discussed code will ever be compiled, but that's something else)<br />
      <br />
      Then, some people whose names I won't use here started a 2-page dialogue in either a non-english language or in a form of 'teh 3ngl!sh' that is actually even harder to read. (I'm really happy with that you're talking in the IC forums now, guys :up:. thanks)<br />
      <br />
      In the past, when anyone went over the smallest line, either dirkeftly (then Atero) or one of the other guys stepped up, powered up his flamethrower and stopped the madness.<br />
      Today, most of the known AVS artists don't visit this forum on a regular basis anymore or just lurk. I'm not saying they should return, that's a personal choice, but they are surely missed.<br />
      <br />
      I think that that's what's being missed the most now: Not someone who goes in agains all the rules of course as it used to happen, <i>but the presence of a certain atmosphere (or whatever) where people correct each other to behave normally.</i><br />
      I admit that I have not been correcting people where it was needed too, but I usually tend to stay away from getting angry on a forum. After all, I'm 'just another member' like the other person is too. I'm also not certain anymore that other members - or better, mods - would join in such a discussion, since there is only a very small group of members left here who try to keep this place tidy..</p>

      <br />
      People just started to talk about the hostility of the forum in this thread since the question was already answered.

      <br />
      1) First, say your pray.<br />
      2) Get really ready while you're listening at the ending of music.<br />
      3) Press 'U' in a perfect shift (end of music) so the next preset will automatically switch.<br />
      <br />
      It's so easy! ;)</p>

        <br />
        Personally i just can't stand people who make the X question the Nth time or people who can't even explain what it is that they want or people who are just in the wrong goddamn place in the beginning with...<br />
        What can i say, im easily annoyed, and when i get annoyed i tend to open my mouth rather than just shut up and ignore it (which would be the decent and best thing to do), that's just me.<br />
        <br />
        I could ignore idiots and n00bs and idiotn00bs, but i choose not to, i'll rather make a rant or a sarcastic comment or whatnot, than let the rage build up on me and then one day just explode and do something rash.<br />
        <br />
        AVS forums is my steam valve sort of :)<br />
        Pity for the new people though.</b>

      <br />
      When I read the topics over here, it seems as if 80% isn't about AVS. It's all about bashing each other, posting pics and other senseless meaningless rubbish. Probably the reason why most of you also reside in the Recycle Bin forum... ;)

      <p class="post-content">Well to my excuse the people who usually even discover there's a thing called AVS within winamp most likely have a braincell or two more than people that have problems operating winamp itself.<br />
      <br />
      I guess i expect more out of people who come here. I just have this illusion that people <b>aren't</b> idiots. But im always proven otherwise.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You do have a point there; if you want to make AVS your hobby/occupation/whatever, you should be willing to do some research yourself. I just think ignoring is often better than posting nonsense.<br />
