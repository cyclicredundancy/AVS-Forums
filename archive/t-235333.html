<div class="posttext">[offtopic]That reminds me, when I use the u&amp;y keys to switch presets AVS stops for a couple of seconds (it has stopped even for 10 seconds at times) and then switches to the preset, when i used to run AVS on Win98 it didn't stop to &quot;think&quot; at all and the switch would be instantaneous. I wonder what's up with that :weird:<br />

<br />
As we can't do sth about noobs, they will always be there, we have to deal with them. So:<br />
<br />
First, I'd suggest a big flashing red sign/link the first three times somebody enters the forums, displaying:<br />

Before YOU post anything use the SEARCH-Function<br />

or sth like this, because I didn't see the link at the first time, lined up with the the other red links above as it is.<br />

<div class="posttext">AVS forums is quite the hostile place, for starters we could be more nicer to new people, but that isn't always so easy.[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
It is difficult sometimes to be nice and some in recent times have been complete idiots and being civil is more difficult.<br />
<br />
But what really was all that wrong with this/nils99's thread.<br />
<br />
True the question has been asked before in a roundabout way.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should look at the way the threads are responded to in Winamp Technical support where if anything you get more newbies asking more foolish questions.<br />
<br />
The general reaction there is one of support and welcoming even in the face of stupidity and sometimes crazy viewpoints.<br />
<br />
Simply ignore the threads if they are too much.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in newbies defence there is some aggression here towards them. <br />
<br />
We are going to get them here it is the new breed of people taht use the Internet now. <br />
<br />
It used to be people were glad of help they would try and find out themselves answers now people just ask without looking and more often then not demand answers.<br />
<br />
Ignoring is not easy especially when it is community that you have spend sucha long time building and the want/need to make it stronger with new useful members and stop people leaving.<br />
<br />
But try and give it a go. :-)<br />
<br />
I know I don't come here much. I pop in every so often to check what is happening but if there is a real problem thread you can use the 'report to moderator' link and all the mods of this forum will get an email and we can take any action if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th January 2006, 22:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Some of my random thoughts on what is or has been happening recently..<br />
<br />
Often a thread gets started by a newb who's asking for a simple thing, not knowing if that function exists to begin with. For example we'll take switching presets per song.<br />
The first reply then is in the line of &quot;search + angry emote&quot; , leaving the question unanswered. Bashing the noob for it is good IMO, but only after the original question has been answered.<br />
<br />
The next post will be about &quot;how it could be done, theoretically&quot;, complete with ASM code and all if possible. The person who started the thread isn't interested in this. Again, discussing how it could be done is good, or better: great, but only after the question has been answered (and if there is any chance that the discussed code will ever be compiled, but that's something else)<br />
<br />
Then, some people whose names I won't use here started a 2-page dialogue in either a non-english language or in a form of 'teh 3ngl!sh' that is actually even harder to read. (I'm really happy with that you're talking in the IC forums now, guys :up:. thanks)<br />
<br />
In the past, when anyone went over the smallest line, either dirkeftly (then Atero) or one of the other guys stepped up, powered up his flamethrower and stopped the madness.<br />
Today, most of the known AVS artists don't visit this forum on a regular basis anymore or just lurk. I'm not saying they should return, that's a personal choice, but they are surely missed.<br />
<br />
I think that that's what's being missed the most now: Not someone who goes in agains all the rules of course as it used to happen, but the presence of a certain atmosphere (or whatever) where people correct each other to behave normally.<br />
I admit that I have not been correcting people where it was needed too, but I usually tend to stay away from getting angry on a forum. After all, I'm 'just another member' like the other person is too. I'm also not certain anymore that other members - or better, mods - would join in such a discussion, since there is only a very small group of members left here who try to keep this place tidy..</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with this thread, it's actually quite a decently put question (what if somewhat frequently asked...) But the 3 other threads you already locked, now there was definetly something wrong.<br />

People just started to talk about the hostility of the forum in this thread since the question was already answered.</div></div><hr />

No offence to you, but if you did the same in Winamp Tech Support, you'd be banned within a week.<br />

When I read the topics over here, it seems as if 80% isn't about AVS. It's all about bashing each other, posting pics and other senseless meaningless rubbish. Probably the reason why most of you also reside in the Recycle Bin forum... ;)</div></div><hr />
