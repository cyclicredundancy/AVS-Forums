<div class="posttext">I've been reading the AVS forum for about a year now... That to the big guys for many code idea, and thanks for quite a few others with some killer work arounds or insain usage of simple effects.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Why don't you try making some presets then?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok,,, I did not what to BSP so much rather just to say hello. I don't have any auto-install pre-sets. But here's a quick and dirty .zip file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some interesting presets, I think life-divinity edit is the best of the bunch.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you wanted critique, but here is some anyway :P ....<br />
<br />
- That V;Y;Z;[;\;] text effect is a bit overused<br />
- God in your hands (and similar) get around 15fps on my 3 gig machine... bleeergh! I wouldnt mind so much if the effect couldnt be generated with 1 superscope and a convolution filter.<br />
- Its all a big religeously themed for me :P</div></div><hr />

Meh, I'm not going to say anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PAK-9, thanks for the input,,, I did not put it up for critiique but it is always welcome. But with out critique how can one grow, or know where he/she stands in the world.<br />
<br />
I have a copy of something just like &quot;God in your hands (and similar)&quot; done %100 in superscope. It just does not seam as nice looking.<br />
<br />
Also my presets are not really ment for the PC screen. I use my avs's as only one of my components while doing visuals at raves. So it's more of a background thing rather then watching them intently. Some may seam boaring, but then again if you are high on E, LSD or K, you don't want something to insain in front of your face. It's also because of where I use my work why I have so much religeous work,,, nothing like brain washing fvcking raver.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some quick questions...<br />
<br />
&quot;- That V;Y;Z;[;\;] text effect is a bit overused&quot;<br />
Do you mean in that peice or over all in the AVS scene?<br />
<br />
&quot;Its all a big religeously themed for me :P&quot;<br />
Did you mean a 'bit' religeously themed?  If so, yes true my work comes out like that... wait till you see some of my other ones,,, you'll be out burning bibles, and bashing buda. hehehe<br />
<br />
Edit: I also run my patches at 400x300, or in 800x600 with pixeldoubled turn on. It works wonders with my progector when I hook it up with a VGA cables rather then NSTC-SVideo</div></div><hr />

<br />
please by all means go head say what you think. Worse comes to worse you'll only teach me.<br />
<br />
Ps still trying to figure out what code is referenced to. meh,,, it's late my brain is dead from a long week end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
x=x4/(1+z4/dst);<br />
y=y4/(1+z4/dst);<br />
<br />
is better as:<br />
<br />
myVar=1/(1+z4/dst);<br />
x=x4*myVar;<br />
y=y4*myVar;<br />
<br />
Because your doing 2 divisions instead of 4 (divisions are expensive) and the 1+z4 bit isn't recalculated for no reason.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">oh ok,,, I see what he's talking about. But he's going to have to take it up with Elvis, I found a help file by him for 3d. I'm still yet to fully figure out what's going on. The 3d rotation loose me still.<br />
<br />
Add on top of it,,, I want to do red/cyan stile 3d. :) need to learn more.<br />
<br />
PS thanks for helping me speed up code. Now I get 64fps, rather 60.</div></div><hr />
