      Is there any type of guide so that I can learn the math for the superscope and other AVS things with math???<br />
      <br />
      I have played with the AVS presets but I dont get how to make my own.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well you're not going to get anywhere without a rubber voodoo chicken. You see, that's a vital component in making successful presets.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You might try Atero's AVS primer as a replacement, though it comes with no guarantees.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright, I'll answer your question in a somewhat concise manner.<br />
      <br />
      First, answer this question : <i>Why</i> should I learn superscope math?<br />
      If you can't answer that with a reason good enough for you to truly learn it, then you may have made a big mistake.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Get the <i>Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus</i> series by Andre LaMothe - there are two of them - I just got the second one(3D programming) on sunday, and it is awesome. They have a ton of useful information. Basically any math website or book will teach you something that you can use, although books like your standard math textbook will teach you the main concept leaving the rest for you to figure out(i.e. how it is useful, etc). Most of your math classes(until you get to college) will not seem like they are useful at all, but they actually can be - you just have to figure out what to do with what you know - the teacher just says how to do it, but doesn't give a purpose for doing it. mathworld.wolfram.edu is another good place, btw - but you have to know what you arre looking for.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dont know whether you really understood the concept and the logic or you are just experimenting randomly - but I reckon its the second. Good work - keep it up.</p>
