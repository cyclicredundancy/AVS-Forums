<br />
<div class="posttext">Is there any one that could post here any sorce where I would find any info about making a site that could use a &quot;winamp engine&quot; to play shoutcast station and dispaly AVS as a background, using html and flash for that matter.<br />
<br />
Im experymenting with above but cant find any source for it.<br />
<br />
What i mean is simple html page with little flash work ,using one of shoutcast sations as a background music and AVS as a background image.<br />
What i want to do is winamp to play the station but not to show ( at least minimized ) and self executable AVS code.<br />
<br />
I uderstand that low end comps wont display overlay in html but im aiming for high end users. Im running ATI 9700 pro and i like this nifty snik/snak.<br />
<br />
Any hellp ???!!!<br />
Thank all :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Don't think that that would be possible.  Your best bet would be to make your own visualization prog - it'd be easier.:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmmm... thanks anubis2003..<br />
well i can see avs running on my sys in my web site in html as a background and even is overlaying flash black spots too. So it must be a way to do this..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Before you get yelled at:  if you wanna add to what you just said, then use the edit button instead of posting again.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
What you just said is because you have desktop overlay mode enabled.  It will cause certain transparent pictures that you have displayed to show AVS instead, but it only works if AVS is running with desktop overlay enabled on that computer.  Integrating AVS into a webpage is, I believe, impossible.  What you're seeing is actually somewhat of a glitch with the overlay mode.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry about it too much - just try to keep from doing it again - it gets a little annoying(esp. when some people go and post 4 times in a row).<br />
<br />
From what I've gathered, what you are seeing is a glitch with the AVS overlay mode.<br />
<br />
It may be possible, but I think someone asked about this before and nobody knew how to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i guess it'd work, but the solution would not be very elegant - mostly due to the requirements of avs. you can capture sound (line-out) and avs output (overlay via tv-out) from a first computer. an encoded video (like quicktime) should then be embedded via in flash (i guess that's possible due to flash's good scripting possibilites and the rather open architecture). this solution is of course hardware extensive and bandwidth hungry. i'd rather watch for a professional visualization solution. i know that flosc (http://www.benchun.net/flosc/)  goes in the right direction. maybe have a look at vj central (http://www.vjcentral.com/) and its forums (http://www.vjforums.com/), the site is dedicated to professional visualizations, which avs is not!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">off topic - anubis, before YOU get yelled at, fix your fucking sig.  just how many times have you referred people to the forum rules regarding sig length anyhow?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I only yell at people when their sig is enormously huge.  Here, I'll take out the links to my pages, and once WR makes an updated sig for me, then I'll alter it to make it smaller.</div></div><hr />

If any one knows programing in avs let me know it.<br />
I might need some help with it.<br />

P.S. ... dudes please dont yell at each other, it hurts my virgin ears....  stay cool   :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You think that's yelling? That's nothing compared to some of the things Atero's done. If you ever get this website thing up and working right be sure to post the address here, because I for one would really like to see it working, but unfortuantly I am not very good at coding things outside of some loser superscopes and DMs.</div></div><hr />

&lt;edit&gt; btw anubis your sig is about 2.5x past the limit.  that quantifies enourmously huge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and you must ask yourself: is it *really* worth going to all that trouble for a friggin shoutcast station?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TranceFarmer</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th July 2003, 04:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">shure it is ... well if you dont see the posibilities then we have nothing to talk about then, do we??<br />
I belive that shoutcast should be on normal radio station, not mention wizely used wireless networking.<br />
No fricken commercials, usless hosts talking BS, just plain music. Isn't that what everybody is looking for???<br />
Computers are all ready puting in to cars, dvd's, screens, so the question is why not???<br />
<br />
+<br />
 web is growing with possibilies . Am i wrong??<br />
<br />
I have all ready sad too much, so please if you dont have nothing usefull to say about the subject then please don't waist my time.<br />
<br />
p.s. ...it dosent have to be shoutcast station it could be any one that can stream *.pls, but i like them and i think they should be the first ones to be in it.(and they will)<br />
<br />
TF peace</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">umm.<br />
<br />
you do realize that shoutcast is IMMENSLY CHEAPER than AM/FM radio, don't you?  people can't just set up high powered broadcasting towers in their houses you know.  and even if they did, we'd run out of frequencies to broadcast over.  there's only a small bandwidth you can use for commercial radio (fm is 88.1 to 109.7 MHz or something like that, and only in intervals of 0.2; am is 600 to 1600 kHz in intervals of 10).<br />
<br />
and you'll excuse me, but you're wasting more of our time than we are of yours.  this is NOT your forum.</div></div><hr />

I hate when ppl unswer with question on question.<br />
Everybody wanna be a smart ass on those forums.<br />

This is my last respond to this thread.<br />

Thank You Very Much for that WAIST.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Waist?  I have a 32&quot; waist.<br />
<br />
Not everyone here is a smart ass - only a few.<br />
<br />
If it's a waste for you to try to ask a question here, then it'll probably be even more of a waste for you to try to do what you're trying to do.<br />
<br />
If you like listening to music for free without any commercials, then just don't listen to the AM/FM radio - listen to shoutcast stations.  AM/FM radio will always have to charge - there is only so wide of a range of frequencies, and these radio stations have to first get a station and then have to make some money to pay for the incredibly expensive equipment, buildings, and towers.  You can't expect them to be able to play commercial free music - they would go broke.<br />
<br />
If you just skip through Atero's harsh language and other crap, he is trying to help, and does give some good info.</div></div><hr />
