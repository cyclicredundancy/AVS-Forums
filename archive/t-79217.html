      <p class="post-content"><strong>*almost* ready to post my pack... but one step missing =(</strong><br />
      Attached to this is the folder of my pack (w/o intro), but I have one request from you guys :<br />
      <br />
      1. Can someone get a good picture, either for thumbnail or description from a screenshot of the AVS window? (from the pack, of course)<br />
      <br />
      2. Rate it =)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use the PrintScreen button on your keyboard to take a screenshot. Or when the AVS window is active, use ALT+PrintScreen to grab that window only.<br />
      <br />
      Paste it as a new image in your favourite paint program such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. MS Paint will work too but it's stone-age technology compared to decent paint programs. You can get a shareware copy of Paint Shop Pro at <a href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jasc.com/</a>.<br />
      <font color="white">And you can visit astalavista.com to 'register' your shareware copy.</font><br />
      <br />
      Oh, I suppose you already know how to use PiMP or NSIS to make an installer for your presets? Make sure it auto-detects the AVS path (some people don't put it in Program Files).</p>

      Looks like it's going to be a killer pack...<br />
      I like that math preset, kindda funny, takes me back to my highschool dayz... sleeping, skiping &amp; dreaming...<br />
      Great use of text in Animatext...<br />
      Heck almost all of them are up to par with your remix work I've seen.<br />
      <br />
      Anywho- keep it up man... looking forward to the finished pack.</p>
