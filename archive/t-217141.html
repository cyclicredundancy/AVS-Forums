      Sorry Sticky, but i looked all over and still couldn't find a thread that answerd this problem. I was hoping someone could tell me how to stop the visualizations from changing every 10 seconds. I would appretiate it. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">In the avs editor window, click on settings and select Preset/Hotkeys. At the bottom, uncheck Randomly switch presets. From there, everything should work fine!</p>

      </blockquote>You looked all over but you missed the thread right above this one called FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS which states:<br />
      <br />
      <b>Question #9: AVS keeps cycling the presets around. How can I stop this and make it show the same preset indefinitely?<br />
      <br />
      To turn this off, you have to open the configuration dialog first (see Question #2). Then, go to the 'Settings' menu at the top, click 'Presets/Hotkeys'. Now, turn off the checkbox marked 'Randomly switch presets'.<br />
      Note that AVS will never cycle presets while the configuration dialog is open, even when this is turned on. Make sure that this is turned off anyway when creating presets, because you could easily lose an unsaved preset this way.</b>
