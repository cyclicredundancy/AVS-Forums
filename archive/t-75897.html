		I'll just repost my previous AVS wishlist which seems to have vanished from the forums completely...<br />
<br />
Huge wishlist... some ideas are more realistic than others.<ul><li>Wrap-ability for dynamic shift (have to use a 1x1 DM now)</li>
<li>XOR, bit-negation and bit-shifting operators (^, ~, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;)</li>
<li>Add built-in constants like pi, 2pi, pi/2, e, ln(2), log2(e), ... into the language.</li>
<li>Ability to set dot-size for drawing (like line-width)</li>
<li>Ability to change between dot/lines mode in a SSC dynamically per frame and per point</li>
<li>A complete change out of resolution-dependent units. They are still used in line width, font size, ... Or provide the option for pixel-units or avs-units (0..1)</li>
<li>Replace all color selectors by either a color-blender (like most are now) or add a piece of code to assign red/green/blue-values.</li>
<li>Add &quot;current&quot; to the buffer-list for Buffer Blending an effect-list. This would be like placing a Buffer Save at the end of your effect list and using that as blend-buffer.</li>
<li>Add a contrast slider to the buffer-blending mode for effect-lists. It would apply this contrast to the blend-buffer in order to provide a quicker transition from transparent into opaque.</li>
<li>Document *all* functions :) (missing functions docs: atan2 and exp). Exp would probably not be used a lot, but atan2 is vital for conversion between cartesian and polar coordinates.</li>
<li>Expand the 'language' with conditional jumps and returns. It would allow much better code to be written. Of course you would need to teach people things like &quot;minimize the number of jumps&quot; or &quot;make sure that the lesser frequent outcome of condition causes the jump and not the most frequent outcome&quot;.</li>
<li>Fix a dynamic movement not handling extremely large (both pos and neg) alpha values too well. Auto-clamping would be nice.</li>
<li>An option to alternatively mirror movements and/or dynamic movements in both X and Y direction. Like the alternate buffer save/restore. Preferably separate for X and Y. <br />
(hard to explain) A checkbox for the Dynamic movement that, when wrapping is on, chooses the nearest X,Y coordinates for a gridsquare (preferably separate checkbox for x and y). For example when one gridspot contains the coordinate (0.1,0.1) and the next contains (0.99, 0.99), then it would convert the second into (-0.01,-0.01). Or of course the first into (1.1,1.1), so that the 'shorter route' is taken instead of the long route.</li>
<li>A checkbox for the dynamic movement that , when wrapping is on, tiles the image mirrored at the edges so that you don't get non-matching edges. The same as using x=asin(sin(x*1.57))/1.57. Preferably separate for X and Y.</li>
<li>Ability for APE's to use the built-in expression evaluation library...or make it publicly usable through a DLL.</li>
<li>Ability for Render -&gt; Bitmap to read JPEG and PNG (support is standard built-in into Windows98 and higher). No GIF, because GIF is bad (software patents suck) and PNG is a much better replacement.</li>
<li>Improved beat detection. I've noticed that it performs bad even on techno tracks where there is a clear beat. Maybe AVS' b-detection is made for unclear beats and weird drums? (Idea: a simply &quot;nudge&quot; button that allows the user to indicate a beat... press the button a few times yourself in order to hint AVS in the right direction)</li>
<li>An explanation of just what those sliders in Colorfade mean... I think most people sorta get them, but a correct description would be nice :)</li>
<li>Improve the code editor boxes:<br />
 - Syntax hilighting and bracket colouring<br />
 - No length restriction on code (ok an 8K limit should be acceptable :)<br />
 - Multi-line editboxes everywhere... I like to space out my code. Perhaps adding tabs to the more complex effect-dialogs would help?</li>
</ul>I think that's about it... for now :)

		Ack, my connection suddenly dropped and I the message didn't appear here. I can't delete the 2nd one, but anyone who can, please do.
