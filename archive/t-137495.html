<div class="posttext">Teehee...took me all day but I finally got this (mostly) perfect.  Except it seems to like to hug the edges for some reason, and I can't figure out why.  Any ideas?  NO i'm not going to go into detail of the code because it's 12:42 am and i'm tired as FUCK...you'll have to figure it out on your own.  And I don't have a zip util on this comp :tear, tear: so you'll have to paste ALL FOUR SECTIONS OF CODE BY YOURSELF (omfg)<br />

<br />
UnConeD: Fuck off.  If you don't do PHP it's damned impossible to copy/paste everything because HTML doesn't do word wrapping and so you get a shit ton of carriage returns (duh...)<br />
<br />
Siddhartha: Just fuck off.<br />
<br />
Shreyas: Preemptive fuck off.<br />

Finally got this fuckoff over to my good comp...if a mod wants to fuck off that PHP fuckoffosity they can fuckoff do fuckoff so fuck fuck fuck fuckoooooffffffff.<br />

<div class="posttext">really nice :) i like the colors and the smooth look it has.<br />
<br />
this is kinda stupid, but i'll say it anyway: i was trying to do something with that texer pic (kinda bored), and i applied it to the standard starfield and it looked really cool, i think... maybe it'd look even cooler with a better starfield (you know with 3d rotation and stuff), just an idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Err Atero, your code had spaces in it. Any browser will wordwrap text (well, unless it's nested inside an element that is wide already, like this table) that is NOT contained inside a ***60;pre***62;***60;/pre***62; tag, so you wouldn't have had any problems. IE is even less strict and will word wrap at various other non-space symbols too. Other than having no color coding, which is a minor loss IMO, there wouldn't be a difference except that this thread would not be as wide as your ego. And instead of trying to fix the problem, you just edit your post and add a &quot;woo, wide thread!&quot;. That's inviting.<br />
<br />
And why the heck are you bitching at Sid and Tug? They both commented on your scope, which means they went to the trouble of copy/pasting it into a preset, yet you get mad because they made a minor note about the thread width, i.e. bad posting netiquette.<br />
<br />
Just because you're a regular doesn't mean the rules don't apply to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pot to kettle, pot to kettle. You are black. Repeat. You are black. Over.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry all, but i actually told atero to post it here after he tried to post it in an irc chat. (though i didnt realise he wouldnt be zipping it.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now the preset makes a lot more sense! Because i didn't know that i had to multiply the scope and use texer and a texer bitmap i didn't have to make it look like it should... :rolleyes:<br />

I actually like it now, i like it a lot :)</div></div><hr />

unconed: umm...OH YEAH... ;) but phpbb word wraps automatically with &lt;br&gt; tags, if i remember correctly from my hypercube post...<br />

and if i added carriage returns you couldn't copy/paste it, which was my original intent...<br />
