      <p class="post-content"><strong>Superscope won't initialize</strong><br />
      Hi all! I'm having a little bit of trouble with AVS. It's a simple problem, really (at least that's what I hope ;)), but I can't seem to find anything about it in the FAQs or by searching.<br />
      <br />
      I have a problem where I have a preset with two superscopes. The first one initializes fine and does what it's supposed to do. However, the second one (which uses two global vars - reg00 and reg01 - from the first preset) doesn't initialize until I edit something in it. The code seems to be okay, because after I initialize it manually by deleting and retyping an ";", it works fine.<br />
      <br />
      I tried all kinds of stuff to solve this problem, like changing the order of the superscopes, adding virtually every used variable to the 'init' sections of the superscopes, restarting WinAmp, but nothing seems to work.<br />
      <br />
      I attached the preset (with comments in the AVS editor) if you want to take a look yourself.<br />
      <br />
      Any help is appreciated. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ow, and I forgot to add. If you're checking out the preset, please know that it relies on beat detection for most of the movement. So make sure to have some music playing. ;)<br />
      <br />
      Also, when you duplicate the second superscope, the copied version <i>does</i> initalize. Try duplicating it ten times to see the effect that I was aiming for in the first place. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">the problem:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>dist=sqrt(sqr(x_dist)+sqr(y_dist));</code>
</pre><br />
      fixed:<br />
      <pre>
<code>dist=sqrt(sqr(x_dist)+sqr(y_dist)+c);</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      you should add a value inside the function "sqr". i don't know why, but it works :)
