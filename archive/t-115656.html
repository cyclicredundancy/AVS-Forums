			<strong>Why not simple alpha blending?</strong><br />
		
		

		Wanna simple alpha blending in SuperScope for each pixel or line. In addition to red, green, blue variables just one more: alpha... Strongly wanted.

		For static alpha blending, you can use a Set Render Mode w/Adjustable Blend.<br />
Why do you want alpha blend in ssc?

		This will allow easy create different effects on &quot;objects&quot; built using SSC. For example - glow effect arond LED lights in my VU-meters. Or around any other light in new preset. With size of glow changing in response to music. In my TryCatchThemAll it will allow remove black contour around lights. If there are lot of SSCs in frame - then per-pixel alpha blending is more effective than any other way. You can create semitransparent flame. Smoke trace. Mix two objects made from SSCs - parts of objects can be transparent with gradient. Object can smooth appear or disappear  in response to music. And that will work for particular &quot;object&quot; only. Kinda of incapsulation.

		You can still do that with the adjustable blend thing.  Besides that, ask yourself 'Will other people use this, too?' before you make this kind of post.  Personally I don't think it has much use at all...

		But I'm sure they will. It gives more simple way to create different effects.

		What effects?  Not many people are skilled enough that they'd need, or be able to create, good effects that require Alpha blending.  Few people even need DM Alpha blending.

		Man, if this looks complex for you - that deosnt' mean it will look complex for others. Just think about alpha value as about 4th color. 0 value means 100% opaque, 1 means 100% transparent. RGBA - is widely used combination in computer graphics.

		My point is, people really have no use for that because most people to linear scopes, in which alpha blending will get just about 0 notice.  Even when you are doing solid scopes, it's much easier to do static blending, or no blending at all

		If you're so smart, you do realize that you can use the adjustable blend for the scopes or use addittive blend with darker colors.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is need for alpha blend if that means &quot;opacity&quot; (like in photoshop or likes)<br />
<br />
I think antialiasing in scopes would be good, and i believe UnConeD made a APE that used a scope render with antialiasing, so it is possible.

		Man, you made excellent presets but I do not agree with you.

		I can see how it might be useful, but I'd like to see graduated between the points. (I'd like to see the same thing with the colours too)

		That can be done with lot of points. But to not overload processor (my Athlon takes +20 C on some presets) it could be more simple way.

		It shouldn't have to be done with lots of points because it will slow down a preset. That's why I'd liek to see it built in.
