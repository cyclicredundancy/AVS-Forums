<div class="posttext">live in the sense, the one who is making presets and not retired.<br />
who do you think is the person?<br />
btw. if it werent for a live artist, the best one would have been UnconeD of course!:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">UnConeD is still semi-active.  He's not &quot;dead&quot; yet.  There are too many people that are good to choose one.  I like tuggummi's presets a lot right now, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 19:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i'd say Tuggummi or Jheriko</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 19:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">But im not techincally advanced. I just use a lot of simple tricks (A LOT) to get to the final point. I in no way can be called the most techincally advanced artist.<br />
<br />
I say Zevensoft, and im 100% right.<br />
Jheriko could be the best if he just had some more know-how on dm's, like UnConeD. No offense jheriko, but ssc's aren't everything :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 19:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jheriko has the best ssc's IMO, and zevensoft does have some nice combinations of DMs and SSCs, but it's too hard to say who is the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 21:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I go with option B.Zevensoft has some presets that are equal to UnConeD`s or even better.The new Ocean preset isnt very advanced but it is awesome and Matrix Reality is one of the most complex presets.Jheriko too is great but like Tugg said a superscope isnt a dynamic movement.Top 5 : UnConeD Zevensoft Jheriko Tuggummi MaxPudding(he has some of the best DMs in the bussines).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th March 2003, 11:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i lime tugg's presets, but i agree that they arent technically advanced</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th March 2003, 15:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">My ranking :<br />
<br />
1. UnConeD (Not exactly active, but still...)<br />
2. Zevensoft<br />
3. Now here's the clashing :<br />
<br />
Jheriko (3 DMs to make a cube? Yeesh, some of us have slower comps ya know), Nixa (Not right now, but he's certainly going there), MaxPudding, PAK-9 (Let's not forget him) (He IS still alive, is he?), Atero (A bit low on the scale for now), and a few others.<br />
<br />
Perhaps El-Vis in that list of thirds, but he's not exactly alive...<br />
...That and AVS-King - But a bit lower on the scale.<br />
<br />
After that, it's pretty much a huge pot of the 2nd-rate pros (in terms of technicality)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Fsk, of course we like you, but you're a lot like Jheriko. You know a lot about ssc's, but not so much about dm's. Though i hope you learn about them soon! You're stuff kicks ass!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I was not expecting to get my name mentioned at all in this thread.  'Specially not from atero.  Amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Its irrelevant realy. How do you define 'best' and how do you define 'technically advanced'. And does it matter that your technically advanced? Some of the greatest contemporary songs are written using the same four guitar chords. A good preset maker is a good preset maker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wasn't really that upset:). It was more of a joke than anything else. Just wanted to show you that preset:P.Hmmm, why did only two people DL it:?. <br />
<br />
Lego you are right,let's stop talkin about this and just make presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">damn...that superscope is BIG.Overall pretty nice preset but it need a lot of stuff to make it truly a 5 star preset overall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I guess my vote goes to Jheriko, he seems to know a lot of code.  &amp; then FSK cause his scopes were ridiculous.<br />
<br />
But honestly, knowing code can help you make some neat presets, but style is what separates the men from the boys.  I'd take a Yathosho visualization over UnConeD's stuff any day.</div></div><hr />
