      <p class="post-content">Not necessarely, i mean, what do you do when you want a background sound for your webpage with a wav? (i know you don't want this, but let's assume you do :p) The answer is you make it LOOP! With midi's being pretty small files already even if it's a full lenght song, a 10-30sec looping midi would be really small and would go under the 15kb limit along with the animation in your avatar. Now i don't know how long music or how many frames you could have, but it can sure go under the limit if needed ;)<br />
      <br />
      Im mostly guessing, but im pretty sure it's possible and not only "in theory" :blah:<br />
      <br />
      But i really do hope that no one will ever get the urge to do it! :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Lol, me to<br />
      <br />
      Theoretically, it WOULD be possible, but midi's capabillities are limited to the soundcard on the one hand (how many instruments, etc) and on the other hand to just sequence and arrange those insturments ... no filter effects, no reverb, no phazers, no flangers, nothing :(<br />
      <br />
      As for music loops, have a look here:<br />
      <a href="http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/index.htm#" target="_blank">http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/index.htm#</a><br />
      This is a funny made guide to electronic music describing nearly every style you can imagine featuring sound loops from popular artist.<br />
      <br />
      Give it a try, have a look at Trance &gt; Goa and what come futher and then tell me wheter you can redo this in midi or not ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, no way you can make that in midi to sound like anything, but...<br />
      <br />
      Jungle -&gt; Experimental -&gt; Sample 3 "Aphex Twin - 4"<br />
      <br />
      That sounds like a midi already! :D<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, im sure that the inter-web is full of midis even 10sec loops, just go pick one ;) So why should i bother to make my own?<br />

      <p class="post-content">There are actually already mp3/wav -&gt; midi converters, but they don't work well at all(even on simple 1track pure-instrumental sons). Doing it requires a lot of work, and is beyond our capabilities currently.<br />

      I have made my own soundformat before that could fit thousands of hours of music in a file the size of an mp3. It used the system bell to make the sound. :p Annoyed the hell out of my family - lol.</p>

      All it does is convert notes to a corresponding frequency(I found out the formula for this on the internet), and then just used the dos functions(I believe they are sound, sleep, nosound) to play the notes for a specific length of time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">no - that'd be just as hard as with midis.<br />
      <br />
      Read up on the wav&gt;midi conversion and see how difficult that is. It ain't easy. The program has to try to pull apart the wav and seperate it into different instruments, and then(assuming it did the first part correctly) has to try and determine which note is being played, as well as strength it was played with, duration of play, etc - when many different notes are probably going to be played at one time. The amount of gaussian transformations is mindboggling now, and the prototype programs hardly make something remotely recognizable from the original song.</p>

      </blockquote>depends on how you use midi data.. it's actually a professional sound format, which allows to play it on any midi-device (hardware and software). common mediaplayers and cellphones of course are consumer-software with different purpose, they play <i>beeps</i>.<br />

      <br />
      As soundfonts get better, midi's will begin to sound almost exactly like the real thing. They are beginning to get close, and with programs like fruity loops you can create some amazing music.</p>
