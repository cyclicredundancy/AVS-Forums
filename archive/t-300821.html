		I think this is the most advanced I've made this far.<br />
It's not complex in any way, it just happens to be so that I'm not too familiar with scripting and such.. -.-'<br />
<br />
Well, I hope you like it anyway!

		Just a not: if there are lots of beats in short time, the screen tends to get brighter and brighter over time till everything is white.<br />
<br />
Turning the fadaout effect up a little fixed that for me.<br />
<br />
Other than that it looks pretty nice, but &quot;oh boy!&quot;... thats a lot of cascaded effect lists for sure =)... and a lot of superscopes as well... must have been a lot of work.<br />
<br />

 Lots of work indeed, but not too complex.<br />
