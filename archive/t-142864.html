      <p class="post-content">I'm not going to do a big in depth review as I don't have the time right now, but I'll give you a couple of points.<br />
      <br />
      1. Begin the name of your presets with a number so that they load in a specific order on my computer - the intro should be first, etc.<br />
      2. A couple of the presets are kinda n00bish, but it looks as though you are progressing out of that.<br />
      3. Several are way too bright. Tone the colors down some - nothing is worse than a screen that just goes completely white for 5 seconds or so.<br />
      4. Some of your DMs are way too jumpy and fast. Slow them down some. Along with bright colors this really begins to hurt the eyes.<br />
      <br />
      Overall Score: 3.5. Good, but not terrific. Keep up the good work though - you're getting better.</p>
