      So, after reading a few of the threads on cubes n'stuff, I made this. I'm pretty pleased with it, except for the weird flicker that happens sometimes on the beat. Any ideas? Thanks a bunch!<br />

      <p class="post-content">never mind, it seems as though beat was executing during the pixel portion of the ssc, so i updated it to store the variable change in temp variables, and update the main ones in frame. i put the fixed version up, if anyone is interested :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">;) Interesting cube but you should rename it because it isn't a cube the whole time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thats true.... i think i should also find a way to work it into a full blown preset :)<br />
      <br />
      it would be awesome if i could get it to generate objects other than a cube as well... any ideas on that?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Cube : (done)<br />
      Rectangular Prism : (done)<br />
      Pyramid : Simply make the cube/rectangular prism converge into one point. (x1=x1*(z1*0.5+0.5);y1=y1*(z1*0.5+0.5); for z1=-1...1)<br />
      Triangular prism : Same as pyramid, but make it converge into a line (Omit either extra x1 or y1 line, but not both)<br />
      Other prisms : Most of these are not regular...<br />
      Hexagonal Prism : I'm not sure, but x1=x1*(2-abs(y1));</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice work Moltarx :up:<br />

      <p class="post-content">if i could find a small enough texture that wouldnt clump together that would be awesome. i spose i could just drop the number of points it is generating to fix that though...<br />
      <br />
      Jaheckelsafar - do you have that ssc? i would really love to take a look at it :)</p>
