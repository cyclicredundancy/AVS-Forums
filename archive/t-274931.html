<div class="posttext">I have a problem with the visualizations feature (namingly the visualizations provided with Winamp's install).<br />
<br />
When I turn them on, everything is fine... But, after a minute or so and few automatic changes of the visualizations, it all goes screwy. Some visualizations show only blank screen, some show blinking colours, some little fragments of what they used to be (like only the middle wheel of few that were there originally), e.t.c. The only way to turn them back to normal is to switch off and then back on Winamp. Still, even then they screw themselves up after a rather short while.<br />
<br />
What may be causing this?<br />

<div class="posttext">this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=224571&amp;highlight=react+to+music) may be useful, if a little old.<br />
<br />
Some additional questions to help us answer your question better: <br />
<br />
- Does AVS react to music at all?<br />
to test: <br />
<br />
<br />
1) open the avs editor<br />
2) select Main<br />
3) enable Clear every frame<br />
4) click [-]<br />
--- The list should now be empty<br />
5) click [+] &gt; Render &gt; Simple<br />
--- A spectrum analyzer should appear, displaying your music, <br />
like the one in winamp's main window.<br />
If you see a flat line, then AVS doesn't receive sound information.<br />
<br />
- Are you using any additional plugins?<br />
<br />
- What type of file are you playing? (MP3, M4A, OGG..)<br />
<br />
- What version of AVS are you using? Notice that v2.81c (came earlier with winamp 5.31 and 5.32) is broken. <br />
Make sure you're running AVS v2.81d.<br />
<br />
- did you try a clean install (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=161361#clean) ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, it reacts. I can see that from the visualisations themselves, yet I even checked it as you proposed.<br />
<br />
I WAS using SnesAMP, but now I use no additional plugins.<br />
<br />
MP3. Plugin - the default one.<br />
<br />
I'm using AVS v2.81d<br />
<br />
Just did a clean install with removing the whole winamp folder before reainstalling.<br />
<br />
As I said - it looks like some parts of the visualisations (not all of them, mind you) switch off. Somehow I get a perfectly working visualization, sometimes a part of it, sometimes barely anything (i.e. Zero G maze II is reduced to few (depending on the bpm) triangles emanating from the centre), sometimes the screen is just flashing, and sometimes I get nothing.<br />

<div class="posttext">What are the specs of the computer you are running?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this will help, but it did for me once before:<br />
1. Open AVS editor<br />
2. Click on &quot;settings&quot; in the menu bar at the top, then click &quot;Display&quot;<br />
3. Tick the check box labled &quot;Overlay Mode&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm using overlay mode as I'm using my TV as speakers, sending the visualizations via overlay to prevent burn-ins.<br />
<br />
They're also set as the desktop colour.<br />

<div class="posttext">Sound's like good stuff you got, I don't know why it would keep screwing around like that. Updating you video card driver sometimes fixes it (sometimes even rolling back), but I'm sure you keep it updated. Tweaking a few settings on your display driver might help. Uh, what else is there... well that's all I can think of. Sorry if it didn't help much.</div></div><hr />
