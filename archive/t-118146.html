      <p class="post-content">Up is LITERALLY the only effect I haven't seen before. Everything else has been done before; almost exactly in some cases.<br />
      Sorry if that sounded like bashing, it wasn't meant to be...<br />
      I gotta give you credit for not using the classic "blitter feedback + water + moving particle = DISCO PARTY!" preset, though :p<br />
      <br />
      Hmm...suspicious...I'm the only one I know of that's ever used the water+color clip effect... ;)</p>

      You boys go and type what you like on the forum, Have a bit of fun.<br />
      Exercise your freedom, its much better than having a forum seemingly run by 1 or 2 self confessed 1337's. Not the actual moderator (the real person that runs the show) dont listen to anybody unless its the moderator.<br />

      Minus, I liked the hand ball preset,<br />
      <br />
      The good things about your presets in my opinion, are that you are going for minimal presets, some really good colours in there too, very nice on the eyes.<br />
      <br />
      What I can say would make them better, is the usage of the original presets is getting played out and is probably better used by ppl at home that dont post AVS presets. Unless you use them to some specific effect in conjunction with a cool SSC or DM etc that you made your self. I suggest you grab your self a Maths text book and have a look at some concepts and have a go at trying them out, with a bit of AVS coding basics, circles, lines, waves, and combinations of them. Try type coding on loaded examples. By type coding it just means have a go at changing variables and make some stuff up to see if it works, you'll find that if you persist you might stumble onto some cool stuff and learn whats happening in the process.<br />
      <br />
      You got a good basis there as far as visual:igor: asthetics go. Push the envelope bro.<br />
