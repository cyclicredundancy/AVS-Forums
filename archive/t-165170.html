      Well, like GHz 2 is on the way, I would want some remixes of GHz 1 by You. It seems that only yathosho commented on it at deviantart and it would also be a chance to see it for those who didn't. I've included a zip with all the files required (didn't include installer, because it's dumb as hell, next time I'm gonna use PimpBot), except the APE's, which would be Texer and Color Map by Steven Wittens, Convolution Filter by Tom Holden. Also you may need Tuggummi's Bitmapped II pack to view my remix of his Fat Osc preset. Somehow, the Images In My Mind don't work as they did on the "old" AVS (The one that is still packaged with 2.x Winamp). It seems that parts of the alpha blending don't work.<br />

      I have got no deadline yet, but when I'll have one, I'll let you know. Thanks.</p>
