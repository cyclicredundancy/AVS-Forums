<br />
Hi outta there.<br />
<br />
I got a really annoying problem: When i decided to relax and launched avs, i can't enjoy the music anymore.:mad:<br />
<br />
That's because avs 'generates' a REALLY disturbing noise: It 'crackles ' the whole time. It depends from the preset which is running, but the complexity of the preset isn't important.<br />
<br />
I tried VERY long to solve this problem, played with the process priority sliders, size if the avs window, bpp....and many more things i can't remember yet.<br />
<br />
But today, I tried another way: I took a preset which always prevented from enjoying music and started the 'Winamp AVS Editor'-Window. I thougt that one or more ...parts(?) of a preset hates my system (or config) and i had to take it out.<br />
<br />
Hmm, since i can't just take out some parts of a preset I decided to move the parts around before I delete the preset.<br />
<br />
So I just took a 'Trans / Fadeout', moved it outta the effect-list containing it ...and *bang* the sound was clear.:eek:<br />
<br />
I tried this with other presets...it was always the same!<br />
<br />
That's it. Now, has/had anyone of you the same problem ? Does anyone now a final solution (or workaround) ? Is that a known prob ? etc.<br />
<br />
(<i>Uh, yeah, almost forgot: I'm using Winamp 2.76 and AVS 2.5 under w2k running on a AMD Athlon 1 Ghz with 512 MB RAM </i>)<br />
<br />
Please Reply, thx in Advance.
