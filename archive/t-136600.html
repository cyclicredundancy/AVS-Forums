      Well, its 4:07 PM and im stuck infront of my computer.. Churning out AVSpresets instead of essays. I guess 4 ubercool presets in 4 hours is a fair effort. (at least i think they are nice)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The <i>chopin files</i> preset is great, good original idea and relaxing :) Tho more different notes couldn't hurt (double notes?)<br />
      <br />
      In the preset <i>This Mess We Are In</i> I can't help but wonder were you too tired while made the preset or do you really think that putting an ignore/replace effect list inside a ignore/replace effect list has somekind of an effect? ;) Also the r=r*r movement above the ignore/replace effect list doesn't have any effect ;) They just suck fps from your preset.<br />
      <br />
      Good presets, but don't let AVS come first and fuck up your school! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">ah, but seeing as the notes currently have no 'bars', they are just lines reaching to the sky or floor, i would have to completely redo some of the concept to do that.<br />
      <br />
      tugg: cheers man, probably all of those presets need some cleaning out.. the movement was never meant to do anything, it was probably just there leftover from the preset i started with, or something.<br />
      the ignore replace convention.. i dont know why but i stll do it all the time.. it just makes it all so neat looking.., though there is definatly not meant to be two effect lists inside each other. Anyway, that presets was meant mainly as a bit of fun with colour matching.<br />
      <br />
      Here is the other one i did that night AFTER posting those ones.<br />
      I really like this, even if it is a bit plain. It started off as the same effect only in two dimentions. So its alot more exciting than it was going to be. BTW, turn pixel doubling <b>off</b>, it looks a zillion times better, and actually runs slightly faster... If anyone could explain <i>exactly</i> why this is i would be a happier soul.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe i should be saving some of these for an actual release.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, that would take some recoding. That's all there is to it. If you do do it, don't fail because of it. If you're failing already, what have you got to lose. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">well sid , its your choice i am not forcing you to do double notes i was just suggesting it might look even better with them(it still looks good :))</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think it looks better when you cant see the tops/bottoms of the notes... it looks all... jazzy. I might put dots next to some of the notes.. and there are already some unfilled, and some filled.<br />
      <br />
      If you like, ill let you imagine that they are <b>already</b> double notes and that they are joined off screen :D<br />
      <br />
      Did anyone else even look at the other presets? The cube one took me ages... Or were they just all so shite that they weren't worth the mention. :rolleyes:</p>

      Latte's a nice one to chill to, but would be better is the background wasn't white.<br />
      <br />
      This mess, well, it's a flow presets. It's not bad, but again, too white for me.<br />
      <br />
      The chopin files just seemed to have the most potential to me. I think that's why people latched onto it.</p>
