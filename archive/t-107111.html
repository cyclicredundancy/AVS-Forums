      <p class="post-content">Are you sure it would have only positive effects?<br />
      I mean it would happen that it would draw away all the attention from APE's if they are in their own forum and the forum would only have a few regulars that post in there. Then again it would be a lot easier for the ape developers to have their own forum.<br />
      <br />
      Personally i wouldn't follow it so much, because i find apes too slow and i just like to do things myself even if i know i can't make it myself :rolleyes:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think there is much need for it. I think there is, sadly, far to few people making APE's to justify it.<br />
      <br />
      And then it has to get nullsoft staff approval - I had to battle, it seemed, to get the AVS reviewers forum :) - Which takes forever as they never post backstage or anywhere.</p>
