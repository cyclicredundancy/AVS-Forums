<div class="posttext">Hi. I was wondering, have anyone made the visual that Brian has in The Fast and The Furious? If yes, where can i find it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:| this will be serious fun... anyway, so, to make things clear, Brian has no visuals. maybe his car had some but i can not fucking remember so try to describe that effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol.. fine.. ill be specific.. i need the visual brians laptop has in his first race.. so, anyone made this or not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think hboy wasn't asking where that visualization was playing but more how that specific visualization looked like. Cause at first not everyone in the world has seen that movie and secondly not everyone who actually HAS seen that movie can remember how that certain visualization looked like. So you have to describe it to us in order to get an answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not too many people have the skill to make something as complex as that and im not sure the ones who can will go for it at all, so basicly you're pretty much screwed (you can always ask nicely though, or bribe someone to do it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">LGStreton</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th October 2005, 20:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ehehe =) i know its complex.. but its nice too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th October 2005, 20:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">At least there are a few pretty similar presets. But unfortuantely im a bit too lazy too look them up atm! :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That remindes me a little of UnConeD's &quot;Goldie&quot;. That was in a pack called &quot;Community Picks&quot;. It's not very much like what's in that screenshot, but it's still pretty cool...<br />
<br />
With the right motivation (as in a hefty bribe), I probably could make a preset that looks like that screenshot, but, having not seen that movie, I can't guarantee that I'll get the motion (or anything else) quite right. At least it'd be an opportunity to practice with &quot;Render / Triangle&quot; some more!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that shit? oh man. i remember the movie (sucked bigtime), but that thing i didn't even remember until you showed it. i guess you just can forget about seeing that one...way too boring. as stated above: go for &quot;goldie&quot; from unconed. waaaaaaay better looking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">here's the closest i can find in xmms... it's an openGL render and the source should be out somewhere. so have a look into that.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, seems as if that pic is a tiny bit too small for having a look into it... So guess he most probably won't have a chance to see what you meant in order to search for it.<br />
<br />
/edit: i just removed the &quot;.th&quot; in matt's link and got a fullview of that pic. But it still doesn't show what this openGL-vis-thing might be called...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It wouldnt be a particularily big deal to make a preset like this provided you are fairly competent with triangle ape. It is always rendered from the same direction so you could forgoe the z-buffer and just draw from back to front. However it wouldnt produce a particularily interesting or exciting visualisation so I wouldnt really recommend anyone bother.</div></div><hr />
