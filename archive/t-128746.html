<div class="posttext">Finally i did it ! My first 3d tunnel DM which is so sweeeeeeeet :) It aint the best but it works fast,looks good and its pretty simple.All suggestions and comments(a remix would be nice too) are welcomed.Thanks guys for everything (and i mean everything) !<br />
<br />
PS. Im curently adding colour and improving my black and white pack which i hope would get at least 4.5 :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you've got the movement down good but you need to sort out the part that displays the sides, its really broken so it makes those lines. The rest is good but that needs fixing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th March 2003, 20:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">the nice thing is that its a round tunnel so you dont have those ugly edges that you would get with a square one.Im working on it right now but try it with another texture and you`ll see it goes great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice tunnel. The texture on the walls really isn't as good as it could be but still nice. It is kind of interesting that the preset is called hungry and I am Hungryskull</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ahahahahaha no.<br />
<br />
the tunnel's a bit wide, and the texture isn't showing up right (obviously).  i blame it on the fact that it's not a real tunnel (judging by the code)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 06:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well it's a tunnel preset... can't make them myself, but i think they are a bit overdone and you seriously need either a good idea, or a kick ass texture to make a good tunnel preset nowadays. This isn't that great, not bad, but not great either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 09:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Just try it with another texture, or make the line width smaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 09:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Uhm... <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey this preset is really cool! You only have to add a simple renderer, then you add a dynamic movement with...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, really smart to tell the viewer to make the preset look good :igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 16:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i agree with tuggummi on the tunnel presets but its a good DM to learn how to make 3d DMs, like i say though you need to sort out the texture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 20:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">phaze...you missed the point.  your texture isn't showing up correctly at all; it's just stretching one line all the way across the x (or y?) axis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 21:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Here`s a better version IMO.The texture is the same but looks a bit better.Also included a new preset :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 21:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">phaze, you're an idiot.  the texture isn't the same, the stretched image is.  as i said in #ff, your dm is fucked up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 22:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh blow me...I didnt say its perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">mmkay...if i commissioned a painter to do a subway tunnel, the least i'd expect is an actual 2-d scene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th March 2003, 06:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">here's a fixed version of the dm, altho it looks dreadful. it doesnt even seem to be a tunnel. i also included a correct tunnel with it.<br />
just look for the effect list after the dm and replace the dm with the dm in the effect list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 09:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks shreyas.It looks ugly yeah and the DM by you is pretty nice but i still like to update my own into a better one.Until then here`s a second version of hungry(no skull) :) Learned new things today and im quite proud of myself :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 09:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Not bad, but the texture is still fuxored up. You used lines as the texture to hide the fact that you can't use anything else :igor:<br />
<br />
Still the dynamove roxorz, but please fix the texture bug of it, it would be nice to see something else than lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 09:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Are circles good ? :D I wonder if i can make a tunnel with my name in the walls...time to experiment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 10:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">if you are doing this, try a rectangular tunnel. i think it will look better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 17:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmmm, ideas of tunnels and grafiti names for intros run through my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 17:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">dont bollock me for double posting im too lazy and my sig isnt huge so it wont irritate<br />
<br />
thats a nice DM phaze, i wouldnt say better than anything ive done :p cause its not finished yet. The texture is fucked up. the whole lines thing and whatevers alpha blended if there was nothing between the DM and the buffer save flashes across the screen ocasionally, excellent work now just finish it up and work on textures, you can have all the coding knowledge in the world but if you dont know how to make a good texture then its all worth nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 19:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">here ya go, there's REAL raytraced DM for tunnel. <br />
Im just trying to figure the raytracing out and made the tunnel but i couldnt make it to move( *hint* *hint*) to one direction AND i thing that there is something wrong with the solved k ( i guess that *k=sqrt(k1*k2)* is uncorrect) maping *chould* be correct.<br />
<br />
btw replacing the *k=sqrt(k1*k2* with *k=sqrt(sqr(k1)+sqr(k2))* gives nice tunnel thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 21:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Didnt work to make a tunnel with my name :)  Can you use DM`s to write letters ? It would be very slow but...can you ? Jaak your movement is a bit chaotic,check out my new one hehe. <br />
 T H A N K S NIXA for helping me a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st March 2003, 08:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you can load a texture and alpha-blend it to show only the alphabets, then use this as a texture for a tunnel dm.<br />
<br />
and Phaze, I think the tunnel dm is done before, because I saw something like that before, altho I dont remember where..<br />
<br />
and this is the third time I am editing this message...download my second pack, there you will find a rectangular tunnel which is quite simple to understand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st March 2003, 22:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Probably Unconed with zero-g mazes or nixa :) Tunnels have been done million of times im just learning to create more advanced one.I hope someone will show me how to make the camera actually go into one of the tunnels,cant understand too much of unconed`s code.ANother version :</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">no, I meant to say your tunnel is done before, and its almost like nixa's : in one of the forums 3d dinamic movments, raytracing 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd March 2003, 21:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok searched the forums and found it,but i had no idea about the other one.I just updated the code as much as i could to get the desired effect.</div></div><hr />
