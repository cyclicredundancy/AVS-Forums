			<strong>old version of nullsoft tiny fullscreen</strong><br />
		
		

		hey,<br />
i just want to ask if there is an old version of tiny fullscreen anywhere available.<br />
but im not absolutely sure if its tiny fullscreen. <br />
i used such an visualisation for winamp two (i suppose) and it looked similar to the current. i remeber that the background was always black and the visualisation consisted of circels and lines. it was quite simple and so i liked it<br />
<br />
(i have saerched but nothin found)

		could it be possible that it is the standard visualisation of winamp 2?<br />
by the way i remeber that it was in 1999 or 2000. maybe thats a clue<br />
<br />
and as i already said it consisted of circles and ciculating  lines or parallel lines that represented the oscilloskop and so generated several colors floating to the edge.

		Tiny fullscreen was/is an oscillo/spectrum scope with several internal variations. It was not related in any way to AVS. It was the first one I used, and *could* use, because my first PC had a non-MMX processor. All older versions of Winamp are available at <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/" target="_blank">http://www.oldversion.com/</a>

		AVS should be included with each package there; pick the version you want, or d/l several for comparison. To answer your question tho, no I don't think so, but sb here will correct me if wrong.

Here are some screenshots to help you remember if it was Nullsoft Tiny Fullscreen (NTF) or not :<br />

NTF screenshots<br />
<br />
If not then maybe it was <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/geiss2/" target="_blank">Geiss 2</a> ? It has been replaced by MilkDrop in 2003. Geiss visual effects are very similar to NTF ones.<br />

I have the NTF DLL is you're interested but I'm sure you can find it in an older release. I thought it was distributed with the newest release. NTF is still my favorite plugin. Simple and elegant.

install an older WA version elsewhere on your computer<br />
then copy the .dll from the older version's plugin folder to the newer install's plugin folder

		mh, ok, i tried that, but i only got some old stuff (with winamp 2). i mean things like voiceprint and simple oscilliscope and such stuff.<br />
<br />
i think what i need is an old version oft nullsoft tiny fullscreen cuz its very similar to the visualisation i remember (it was about 2000). but its just a bit more modern.<br />
<br />
so is there any source for an old ntf? i couldnt find anything so far.

		have you tried the changelog (think it's called whatsnew.txt - i don't use winamp), might give a hint which version you look for
