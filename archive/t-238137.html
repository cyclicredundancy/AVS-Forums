<div class="posttext">hey,<br />
i just want to ask if there is an old version of tiny fullscreen anywhere available.<br />
but im not absolutely sure if its tiny fullscreen. <br />
i used such an visualisation for winamp two (i suppose) and it looked similar to the current. i remeber that the background was always black and the visualisation consisted of circels and lines. it was quite simple and so i liked it<br />
<br />
(i have saerched but nothin found)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">could it be possible that it is the standard visualisation of winamp 2?<br />
by the way i remeber that it was in 1999 or 2000. maybe thats a clue<br />
<br />
and as i already said it consisted of circles and ciculating  lines or parallel lines that represented the oscilloskop and so generated several colors floating to the edge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tiny fullscreen was/is an oscillo/spectrum scope with several internal variations. It was not related in any way to AVS. It was the first one I used, and *could* use, because my first PC had a non-MMX processor. All older versions of Winamp are available at http://www.oldversion.com/</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">is there any source where i can find old AVS? <br />
on the winamp page there are just too many of them</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">AVS should be included with each package there; pick the version you want, or d/l several for comparison. To answer your question tho, no I don't think so, but sb here will correct me if wrong.</div></div><hr />

Here are some screenshots to help you remember if it was Nullsoft Tiny Fullscreen (NTF) or not :<br />

NTF screenshots<br />
<br />
If not then maybe it was Geiss 2 (http://www.nullsoft.com/free/geiss2/) ? It has been replaced by MilkDrop in 2003. Geiss visual effects are very similar to NTF ones.<br />

I have the NTF DLL is you're interested but I'm sure you can find it in an older release. I thought it was distributed with the newest release. NTF is still my favorite plugin. Simple and elegant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if it's an el-vis preset coming with winamp, it should be included in the attached file</div></div><hr />

install an older WA version elsewhere on your computer<br />
then copy the .dll from the older version's plugin folder to the newer install's plugin folder</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">mh, ok, i tried that, but i only got some old stuff (with winamp 2). i mean things like voiceprint and simple oscilliscope and such stuff.<br />
<br />
i think what i need is an old version oft nullsoft tiny fullscreen cuz its very similar to the visualisation i remember (it was about 2000). but its just a bit more modern.<br />
<br />
so is there any source for an old ntf? i couldnt find anything so far.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">have you tried the changelog (think it's called whatsnew.txt - i don't use winamp), might give a hint which version you look for</div></div><hr />
