      Pretty neat, I think. It's not finished, but it just looks so cool :D<br />
      <br />
      Plus, if I ever change it, and not like it, and then can't figure out how to change it back, I can just get it here :)</p>

      I tried out all the render effects, and moving particle was the best. I originally had a picture renderer in it's place, that somehow looked like a dancing jellyfish, but I took it out because it looked kinda bad, I couldn't get the code right, and the whole concept was dumb. Now I found the particle and it created a 'plastic wrap' kind of look. :weird:, but :cool:.

      <p class="post-content">I emailed this preset to a friend and he brought up a good point - every once in a while it freezes up. Isn't this because the rand function reaches a low number and stops for a second? How would I go about fixing this?<br />

      btw - sorry about the double posting;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could just use smething like 25+rand(100) or something like that, so you always come up with at least 25.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think you missunderstood me, I wasn't meaning literaly 25+rand(100), but something like that so that every beat you get at least a certain number then add (or subtract something from it). I'll see if I can come up with an actual equation in a little bit.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; Forget what I said, my method would only work with one directional rotaion (ab&gt;0 only) to make my way work you have to change a bunch of things around.<br />
      1. Add sc=1 to init.<br />
      2. Change per frame to t=t+(dt*ab); dt=-sc;.<br />
      3. change on beat to ab=.1+(rand(10)/50); sc=-sc;</p>

      <p class="post-content">I suppose that works, but it doesn't really move much anymore....oh well....<br />

      /offtopic - man, I just can't get over the fact on how close you live to me S-uper T-oast! Only 175 miles! :eek: offtopic/</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree it doesn't really move as much, to get it to move more you would have to tweak the variables around a little bit, I did think of another way to do it, but it doesn't change much besides a variable or two.<br />
      /offtopic I guess it is a a little different living less then 175 miles away, I never thought about it before but there was only one fourm I have been on that has had people living closer to me /offtopic</p>
