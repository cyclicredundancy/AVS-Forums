<div class="posttext">These still aren't great, but I think they are a big step up from the first ones I did. (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=210439) It really helped to get some of the apes that I was missing (How I ever lived without 3d meatballs I'll never know.) Plus I learned a tiny bit about movement coding and overall I am more comfortable with the maze of effects in AVS.  Please give me some comments on these (I probably need to be cut down to size a little!) :D<br />

<div class="posttext">clyde i reckon is your best preset, but i hate to tell you this, that dm does buggerall. The rest i couldn't enjoy to their full extent due to my appaling lack of ape's. so can you please for the benifit of ape-deprived people like me, include all other files in your zip.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Metaballs is a boring APE. Don't overuse it. Oh and please read the preset posting guidelines.<br />
<br />
I don't have any of your .svps, so they don't work either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well i actually have the metaballs ape but i can't use it. Everytime i select it to view/change it's settings winamp crashs. btw same goes for the tenatacles ape too. any idea why they are so unstable unconed?<br />
However i'll keep them installed, just in order to view presets that use those two apes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hm, I have apes in my avs folder that I can't find in the avs editor and apes in the editor that I can't find in the folder, so I just included all the apes I have to cover all bases. If 3d tentacles is called '3d tentacles' then I don't know where the hell it is, although I can see it in the avs editor.(I am really sorry if I shouldn't have included all of these files like this.)  But...I'm sorry if I broke the preset posting rules, what did I do? as for &quot;not having any of my .svps&quot; I was only aware that I used one, (only one appears in my drop down list) and that one came with winamp. and I disagree about meatballs being 'boring', but I get your point. Mr. nudge, thank you for pointing out my transgression.  I guess I will study DMs a little more! *looks embarrased*</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tentacles can usually be found within the render objects.<br />
<br />
If you have an ape in your avs directory, that doesn't show up in the editor, could mean that this particular ape doesn't work. If it's the other way round (apes in the editor can't be found in the folder) it's either because the ape is integrated in AVS itself or its filename is different from the actual name of the ape (this would also explain the first way around).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oops, forgot the file.<br />
(and obviously these aren't all the apes I have, I didnt realize what the size limit on a file was (duh)). Oh and 3d tentacles still isnt here, if someone knows what the actual filename is, please let me know.:hang:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2005, 16:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, posted before I saw your reply, ^..^<br />
tentacle obviously works, but the filename must be different, because it isn't in the folder as &quot;tentacles&quot; OR &quot;3d tentacles&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2005, 16:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that tentacles-ape filename is &quot;amoeba3d.ape&quot;.<br />
So, will glance at your attachment then...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, the point i dislike about your presets is, that you use too much predefined things, such as unconeds render apes or those svps. They prevent you from beeing really creative/making own new stuff. Of course, they look great but they also limit your possibilities. Look at any random common preset: i guess it will be very hard or even impossible to find an artist that uses those rendering apes. Don't get me wrong, such things aren't bad, but as you already said, it's some kind of cheating. You can hardly make own presets but more likely will do something like a remix. Hope you understand my point!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, constructive critisism. Thank you, I forgot I said that stuff about Apes being cheating. *slaps self* You are right, It was just a lot simpler obviously to slap these together than to work harder on understanding scope and movement coding (it gives me a headache!) but damnit, I am going to keep going and someday i will make a preset that will boggle SOMEbody's mind. :D</div></div><hr />

hmm, i'm still waiting for that special day either ;)<br />
But don't give up, as long as you like it for a hobby. Just dig deeper and deeper into the stuff all the time. I guess the most quoted sentence beeing aimed at any noob is something like: 'You won't get everything at once, just keep in with it'...</div></div><hr />

aha! thanks for the hint. See beeferoni: another argument not to overuse them :p<br />

hmm, im curious what hidden &quot;features&quot; they'll show in later windows versions? ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, I have made cool scopes before, I can do it again. I knew out the gate this wouldn't be easy. Thanks for letting me know about the 3d apes instability UnConeD. That is an excellent reason not to overuse them. (I have probably done about as much with them as I'm going to) I guess I just wanted to be a great preset artist right away. or faster than the knowledge was coming, anyway. Thanks for keeping me honest, everyone. :D *Rolls up sleeves, spits on hands and opens the AVS editor*</div></div><hr />
