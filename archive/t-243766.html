      heh this took me sometime but i think you might enjoy it.<br />
      i give credit to. Florin,Zet Hikari,Katphude,Jheriko.<br />
      Thanks for making such nice presets i hope you like what i've done.<br />
      <br />
      the most difficult would have to be the Water Bubbles one because i took me forever to figure out how to place it without to much fps consumption and make it look like a frame by frame thing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your zip file fails. Please find, read and follow the guidelines next time.<br />
      <br />
      Lay it out so people don't have to make effort. A good .zip i can extract into the avs directory and do nothing... a marginally worse one I will extract into the avs directory and its own directory too... this one is just annoying.<br />
      <br />
      You have used copious amounts of code from UnConeD and I see no credit. I am 99% sure its his code... I have hacked it enough to know how he named his variables... also the code features work arounds for old versions of winamp with its tiny code boxes and smaller evallib... something you don't need to do, or want to do.<br />
      <br />
      And.... every preset in this zip is slow and terrible for its speed.</p>

      Jheriko. if you check the comments in the Simple and Water Mirror you will see that i have given credit to UnConeD for his dynamic movements that i used. also to be serious did you try running the avs's in the smallest square possible for the window because they are all tested under 300x 400x<br />
      area and have run atleast 15 fps and lower tops and a minimum of 3 fps. also the effects the test version of Water Mirror is my own design. also to be frank with you.<br />
      IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T DOWNLOAD IT.<br />
      huff huff oh i'm sorry anyway you forget i'm a noob i'm still learning the code so i have to borrow code segments. and besides i learn from what i take because i scan every aspect of the codes i take. sorry if i sound offensive but your reply was just wrong thing to say. i just made this pack and i have just begun to deal with it. anyway from what your saying i'll have to program it too go into the avs folder then hmm. ok. thanks and sorry for the yell.</p>

      <p class="post-content">YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT ! Zomfg and stuff. :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, if someone bitches AT you, don't bitch back, because, no matter how rude he is, unless it's another n00b, that person's bound to be right. Shrug it off, and try to make the best out of the advice he gives you.<br />
      <br />
      I second the "slow" bit. That "smallest square possible advice" is bull. Who the hell watches presets in a tiny window. Anyway, the speed/looks ratio is quite bad here. You've fallen in one of the traps new and aspiring avsers tend to fall in. That's called clutter. Large amounts of unnecessary effects that don't do much, and slow down the preset. Try to clean up the presets, who knows, they might end up looking better than they do now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your presets are slow. Period.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if I came off offensive but the effects you are generating are not worth that much framerate, you can optimise a lot.<br />
      <br />
      As for crediting UnConeD, if you use someone else's heavily preset-defining work its called a remix and you should put their name in the title as such... comments don't get read. If you do this you can avoid the complaints of ripping.<br />
      <br />
      Of course if its something tiny... like a dot+movement clear screen combo, or a random dot/line superscope you will prolly be forgiven. DMs however are huge, don't steal them.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>ok</strong><br />
      sorry Jheriko. anyway if you guys have ideas and want to do somethin then i give you Jheriko and doggy dog the right to remix the remixes. no credit is needed i'll allow it. anyway just please understand that my computer renders on a 8mb graphics chip from yr2000 -_-* i hate it i want more power. *picks up sledge hammer and whacks the %^&amp;* out of the computer for being a piece of ^&amp;%$ *heh ah much better.<br />
      anyway the computer i operate on is worthless and can't get a new till i get some money. wahh i want 128 megs of video mem. anyway whatever you can do, do it. and send me your results. k.</p>

      <p class="post-content">also one more suggestion try running the avs's in fullscreen under 320x 400 something like that at 16 bit because thats when my avs's look good.</p>

      Very good!<br />
      A thing that matters very much in the packs to me is not to use a stuff like this:<br />
      <br />
      [Render objects]<br />
      Blur<br />
      Water effect<br />
      Brightness (optional)<br />
      <br />
      These remixes don't use effect combinations like this.<br />
      So, i like this pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nanakiwurkz, 2 things:<br />
      <br />
      before you go running for a new gfx-card [after you smashed the old one] leave it be. AVS relies to 99.9953026% on the CPU power! almost nothing else is important...<br />
      <br />
      noone uses 16bit color [afaik]. it's not faster it's more likely to be slower than 32bit because everything inside avs is rendered in 32bit, so it only needs to be converted to 16bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">not quite true, GC<br />
      my opengl-based APEs are in fact faster on 16 bit in high resolutions because opengl switches down to 16 bits as well<br />
      <br />
      but those APEs are in, let's say, pre-alpha stage so you were almost right :)<br />
      <br />
      16 bit mode is only there for compatibility and bad gfx cards that dont have enough VRAM for the framebuffer in the chosen resolution at 32 bits per pixel.<br />
      <br />
      800x600x32 is probably the limit of your card, but that would, most likely, run slowly anyway<br />
      800x600x32 takes 3.6 MB VRAM with double buffering (which AVS uses). add to that a desktop with 1024x768x16 which windows probably occupies as well and you have 6.6 MB VRAM used<br />
      <br />
      conclusion: you might need a new gfx card :)<br />
      not one of those expensive 3d cards, a 64 MB is fairly enough for AVS<br />
      <br />
      btw who sold you a crappy 8 MB card in 2000? ^^<br />
      my old 486 had an 8 MB card *g*</p>

      </blockquote>actually its a old Intel 810 graphics chip not card. and one thing i hate is my computer because i own a 16 meg ati rage 128 agp card and i can't use it because the company that made it did not include a agp slot wahh. and i bought the working card at goodwill for two bucks. *bows to the almighty goodwill for having working parts for cheap prices*
