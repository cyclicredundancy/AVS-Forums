<div class="posttext">Here are two of my latest visualizations, both with a similar theme. I really like them, maybe some of you will like them also. <br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">they're actually changing very much. the color scheme is not my taste though. and the first could use a bit more contrast imo. in the second i'd change the white in the CM to black, looks way better then. and the mirror is kinda too jumpy.<br />
and in both you can remove the first movement. it does nothing you couldn't add to the second movement and thus save some speed. plus it makes this ugly 'r-based-edge'.<br />
<br />
good preset as is, but needs some style improvements</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestions. If i combine both movements, i can't get it to look the same. But i'll tinker with it some more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm learning. Here's one i just finished, with a similar theme, but still totally different, and awesome in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Have a taste of red candy, it will blow your mind!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm quite impressed with your latest release Dude but i have one suggestion for you. lay off the Kalaidascope effects. you've used the same exact Kalaida effect in almost every preset you've made. its time to come up with a new theme. suggestion try a 3d scope. with your growing knowledge of the avs world you should be able to do it. suggestion try using el-vis 3d engine scope from el-vis real 3d pack the preset is el-vis_real_3d_start. from there you can add your own xyz codes to the x1=;y1=;z1=; area. try it you'll love it. and p.s. do you want your work to be shown in the first Visualnoobs pack?</div></div><hr />

it really seems you are missinterpreting my role, so i decided to clear things up. I may get to harsh because i am quite <br />
upset being called a noob by a noob.<br />
<br />
1. Being myself a advanced avser I offered help for newbies<br />
this does NOT mean in any case will submit any preset <br />
to any pack youre planning. <br />
<br />
2. I am not a noob, most regulars in here will tell you.<br />
<br />
3. Dont act like youre AVS' lost messiah , noob!</div></div><hr />

suggestion try using el-vis 3d engine scope from el-vis real 3d pack the preset is el-vis_real_3d_start<br />
i'd suggest not using that, but instead using the 3d stuff from PAK-9's AVS Programming Guide (google it)<br />
<br />
reason: el-vis's real3d pack is nice, but it is old and kind of unoptimized :)<br />
code from &quot;elvis_real3d_beatspiral&quot;<br />
<br />
x=x4/(1+z4/dst);<br />
y=y4/(1+z4/dst);<br />
<br />
as you can see there are lots of divisions in there, which can really slow down things if used too often<br />
<br />
optimisation #1:<br />
we divide by the same divisor twice, so we might as well cache 1/divisor and multiply it with both<br />
<br />
optimisation #2:<br />
since dst is only changed once per frame, one can move the divison for that into the frame code box in the much same manner as optimisation #1<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
invdst=1/dst;<br />
<br />
point:<br />
invz=1/(1+z4*invdst)<br />
x=x4*invz;<br />
y=y4*invz;<br />
<br />
there, 3 divisions per point saved<br />
<br />
not meaning to criticise you el-vis, i know that's old code, my code from that time looks even worse :)<br />

forget that site<br />
you know, on the internet there are no moderators, so people like nanakiwarts can post all the crap they want<br />
freedom of speech means freedom of the morons as well :)<br />
and i think the next month, nanakiqwertz is gonna mail his provider because his page is not listed on google</div></div><hr />
