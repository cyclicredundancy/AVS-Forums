<div class="posttext">It saves the current contents of a frame into a buffer. It can also be used to draw the contents of a buffer onto the frame.<br />
<br />
Couldn't you have figured it out yourself?</div></div><hr />

No, why do you think I asked?  I'm not as smart as you, I don't know this stuff. :hang: <br />
<br />
btw - I don't have a clue about your explanation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well if you don't understand that, you could try actually doing something yourself, like maybe reading Atero's AVS primer, reading the AVS FAQ, or just plain searching the fourms, instead of being lazy and asking somebody to do it for you. You don't have to be smart to not be stupid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another taste of AVS Primer pt I: Overview (v1.7.9):<br />
<br />
Misc / Buffer Save<br />
   Allows you to save an image, then rerender it later.  If you want to<br />
   AVS, you HAVE to know this component and how to use it well.<br />
   You have four options - to save, restore, and then two for<br />
   alternately saving and restoring each frame - one is the reverse of<br />
   the other.  The only problem with this system is you have to restart<br />
   AVS to make sure it's working right - the phase (whether it's saving<br />
   then restoring, or restoring then saving) starts when you choose it,<br />
   and you only have a 50/50 chance of getting it right when you do.<br />
   Usually these two blend modes aren't used (or useful, for that<br />
   matter) so it doesn't much matter.<br />
   After that, you can select any of 8 different buffers to use.<br />
   Now, you choose your blend mode - this either blends your image<br />
   into the buffer when saving, or into the current image when<br />
   restoring.  The &quot;Clear buffer&quot; button just turns the buffer black.<br />
   This is a great component, and without it many AVSers would be<br />
   quite lost.  However, there is one problem: It is an FPS eating<br />
   monster.  Try to use as few as humanly possible in your presets.<br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<br />
   Save/Restore<br />
      Determines whether you are saving an image to a buffer, or<br />
      restoring the buffer into the image.<br />
<br />
   Alternate Save/Restore / Restore/Save<br />
      Allows you to alternate saving and restoring every frame.<br />
      Remember to restart AVS after setting this!<br />
<br />
   Nudge Parity<br />
      Switches the phase of the save/restore setting (see above).  Not<br />
      useful IMO; better to just restart AVS.      <br />
<br />
   Buffer<br />
      Select the buffer to save to; there are 8 to choose from.<br />
<br />
   Blending<br />
      See Global - Render Blends<br />
<br />
   Clear Buffer<br />
      If you're having trouble with a buffer, then you can use this to<br />
      clear it entirely to black and start over.</div></div><hr />

Right now you are typing in English.. quite well I might add. Your ability to do this implies that you are capable of logical deduction, the same process that would allow you to figure out what Buffer Save does for yourself, also the same process that allows you to figure out that people asking common questions tend to get looked down upon for not searching FAQs, forums and primers for themselves. You couldn't figure it out for yourself because the easy option of asking someone else was available. Everyone does it, myself included, and it infuriates me because it certainly doesn't help me develop my brain power when I do it and it also clogs the forums with pointless posts and threads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well as a matter of fact, it was a long time.....around 3 months when i realised what are buffer saves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i will try to put it in simple words. the easiest way to understand the basic working of the buffer save is in this example:<br />
<br />
start a new preset. you add an effect-list (can be seen as a layer) and click on the 'clear every frame' checkbox. you put the output of the effect-list to 'ignore'. then place an effect of your choice in the effect-list. add a 'buffer save' below your effect and set it to 'save'. now place another 'buffer save' below (outside) the effect-list and set it to 'restore'.<br />
<br />
the effect is being blended outside the effect-list (although its output is on 'ignore'). well, this is just an easy and pretty useless example. but you can also use the saved buffer in different blending modes, loop it through various 'buffer save' effects or use it in a dynamic movement. try playing around.</div></div><hr />
