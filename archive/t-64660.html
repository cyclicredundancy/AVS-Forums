<br />
<div class="posttext">What exactly does the grid size mean in the dynamic movement trans. My guess is it changes the range of x and y, i.e. if grid size = 16x16<br />
the range of x is -8 to 8 and the same for y. Am I correct?<br />
<br />
If I am correct I'm still confused because changing these values seems to have no effect on my scopes.<br />
<br />
Also what does the rectangular co-ordinates mean?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Rectangular coords use X and Y instead of R and D.<br />
If you turn on rectangular coords, the window is divided into a certain number of sections, so as to keep the preset running fast. The grid size defines how many sections there are. For a more accurate movement, put higher numbers in, but that slows it down. For a less accurate, but faster movement, put lower numbers in.<br />
<br />
It can also be useful for certain effects to have a low grid resolution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Grid size is always used, regardless of polar or rectangular coordinates.<br />
<br />
The idea behind it is that the dynamic movement is a very heavy effect. Recalculating every pixel-coordinate each frame would be impossible, so that's why the screen is divided into a grid. AVS calculates a position for each intersection on the grid, and uses interpolation (averaging from one value to the other) to achieve a smooth effect.<br />
Usually a pretty low grid size will suffice, but sometimes you'll want to set it higher. Make sure that you don't make it unnecessarily big, because bigger grid = slower preset. You should also remember that the horizontal gridsize and vertical gridsize don't need to match. Gridsizes of 2x20 or 40x3 are acceptable.<br />
<br />
As for rectangular coordinates, it means to use x,y (cartesian) coordinates instead of d,r (polar). In polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance to the center &quot;d&quot;, and the angle between the vertical line and the line connecting the point to the center (note that AVS puts 0 rotation vertically instead of horizontally, as is normally done). Polar coordinate-movements tend to produce more circular movements, instead of horizontal/vertical movements.<br />
<br />
Rectangular coordinates is the way to go when you want to do advanced effects though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the help. <br />
<br />
I think I've got the hang of it now. I still don't notice any change when changing the grid size, how do I check the FPS. I did try using d and r with rect co-ords, it seemed to cause the scope to rotate and a swirl. No great surprise when using<br />
<br />
r=r+sin(-e)*2;<br />
d=d-cos(-e)*2<br />
<br />
I've attached my work in progress.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">ok, I am thinking about this for a lot of time, but I just can't figur it out.<br />
I a lot of AVS, i notice variables like this:<br />
xts,yts,dts,xm,xo.  <br />
i noticed this variables in a lot of AVS, and I am also wondering if i change xts to rds does it change the meaning of variable, and what do they realy mean<br />
<br />
 I hope i haven't done something wrong with asking this</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Those are variables made by the user, AVS doesn't use them unless you assign one of them to one of the ones used by AVS(x,y,d,linesize, that stuff).<br />
<br />
  If you change their names you are likely to mess the preset up because it will probably depend on it later in the preset.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Per Frame:<br />
t=t-tx;<br />
t2=t2-t2x;<br />
t3=t3-t3x;<br />
Per Beat:<br />
t3x=sin(rand(123))*0.1;<br />
t2x=sin(rand(123))*0.1;<br />
tx=sin(rand(123))*0.1<br />
<br />
<br />
In this code(taken from one of my superscopes) if you were to change the variable  called &quot;t&quot; to a variable called &quot;fartbrain&quot;, it wouldn't work because later in the code the variable name is still called &quot;t&quot;, but because that isn't the right variable, it won't work right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">there are commonly used vars though. If t is used it usually stands for &gt;t&lt;imer and m for &gt;m&lt;ovement. In your example xm will probably stand for movement(shift) along the x axis.</div></div><hr />
