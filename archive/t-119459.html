			<strong>fairly realistic fire</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Just to explain the file a bit... <br />
<br />
It's kind of slow at higher resolutions since the number of dots increases exponentially. However to make the fire seem full I had to do this. <br />
<br />
Feel free to mess with the code to try and make it run faster, since I'm sure its not completely optimized. <br />
<br />
Also make sure that you are listening to some fairly loud music, since it is volume sensitive. At lower volumes it looks more like a candle than a blaze. <br />
<br />
Also you might want to turn off the BG effect to improve performance. Just turn the entire first effect list off and turn the [Main] -&gt; [Clear Every Frame] on for better results.<br />
<br />
Well, what do you think? :) <br />
:up: or :down: ?

		Well this is kinda my remix of it :D:D<br />
It's the same thing but only as a blue flame.<br />
Maybe you might like it.:P<br />
I was trying to figure out maybe how to get orange on top pf the blue<br />
to kinda look like a Bunsen Burner Since i dont really understand super scope all that well i failed to do it lol<br />
Well maybe you should give what i just said a shot i think it would look freakin amazing.

		How's about attaching the file you so vigorously advertized, kid? :p<br />
<br />
The fire effect is nice, but I'd make it turn off when the music stops (e.g. red=v; green=v; blue=v).  Also try making it a bit brighter...it's not really firey when it's that dull (color-wise).<br />
And you really don't need that buffer save...just set the two sub-effect lists in the second effect list to:<br />
ignore/replace<br />
additive/replace<br />
and get rid of those FPS-sucking buffer saves :) You can also turn off the clear every frame in the second effect list now (it's a minor speedup).<br />
<br />
Slightly sped up DM code:<br />
frame:<br />
t=t+0.2<br />
<br />
pixel:<br />
y=y+0.05+rand(256)*0.0004+0.01*sin(t+x*10);<br />
x=x*1.1+rand(256)*0.0002-0.025;<br />
That creates almost the exact same effect; the difference is hardly noticeable.

		OK, here's the update. <br />
<br />
Atero, thanks for pointing out that I don't need the effect lists. Also, I made the flame brighter, added a blur, and intruduced a simplistic particle &quot;engine&quot; to simulate flying embers. It's not really visible over the blur, though, so for the time I have only one particle set to be drawn. Just duplicate the N=1 effect list to see more, if you can make them out. Turn off the blur for a better look.<br />
<br />
I tried your suggestion for the DM, but it seemed like it cheapened the effect, no offense. I modified it a bit to try to improve performance (I don't know if it even made a defference though), but your change seemed to make it flow strangly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the help Atero, and thanks for the support Kid! I'd like to see your remix, by the way. Meanwhile, I'll try to achieve a blue flame effect as well.

		*eyebrow* As I said, that code produces almost exactly (and I mean, EXACTLY) the same effect.  The only difference is some round-offs.  The same code, without rounding:<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
t=t+0.2;<br />
<br />
pixel:<br />
y=y+0.05+rand(256)*0.000390625+0.01*sin(t+x*10);<br />
x=x*1.1+rand(256)*0.0001953125-0.025;<br />
<br />
The only thing I did was get rid of unneeded calculations - t is only used once in pixel, and it's a linear incrementation, so t*0.2 isn't needed; just change the frame statement to t=t+0.2 instead.  If I'm correct, the rand function prefers powers of 2, so I changed the two to rand(256).  I adjusted the down-scaling accordingly so that the range is the same...so on and so forth.  I just rounded those two numbers off because those last six digits weren't going to do much, and it takes another (minor) load off AVS's calculations.  Don't tell me speedups ;)<br />
<br />
And here's the problem with your embers: they're too small.  Use cfp's convolution filter, or unconed's texer to texture them.

		I give you... ICED BLAZE. <br />
<br />
Basicly, here are the differences between this and regular blaze:<br />
<br />
-BG effect list removed.<br />
-Blue unique effect.<br />
-Much faster fire superscope. (Uses lines instead of dots.)<br />
-Blue FyrewurX.<br />
-3D &quot;spiral base&quot; superscope.<br />
-Movement to give crystal effect.<br />
-Two dynamic movements to create circular motion and zoom (one before &quot;crystal&quot; movement, one after)<br />
-Buffer save and dynamic movement to create circular blur effect.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!

 The blaze2     &lt;== BEST (like real... what else i can say)<br />
 The blaze remix &lt;= Kid dont eaver try<br />
 The iced blaze &lt;== good but still i dont like it - Too fast jumps on beat , too fast(i must run it on full scr.). I'd like it if it would look like real ice cube (it tryed to make ssc like this but i failed....looks like goob job for UnConeD).

		Awsome job Shock Value.<br />
<br />
I like the first on the best ... the Ice blaze is very very ... umm I find it very interesting I like the way it moves and the ice offset part on top of the flame. <br />
It's probably one of the best uses of the firewurkz plugin I've seen .... it looks like smashing bits of Ice. It should be called Icewurkz. All I can say to improve it, is to either slow or less sensitive the way it moves and have it as a part rather than a whole preset.  Thats just it though isn't it is just a development.<br />
<br />
Very impressed over all ... Have you been AVS'ng long ?? If not I have to say that Shock Value will be a great upand comming AVS'er.. I like your style.<br />
<br />
Hey Kid, Sssssscool man I like your version. I can definatly see what your going for I noticed it lookd better when the music was not close to peaking.. mabey turn down the audio spectrum detection..<br />
<br />
Jack, do you call your self the King because you dis fellow AVSers  :hang: ?<br />

		Here's my version of a different SSC that I played around with for about 30 mins check it out. Like to think it kind grows and lasts like a fire. Different code a bit simpler,less particles tho its a fire shaped getosc function.  <br />

		blaze1: Pretty decent.  Fire is tricky, no? :)<br />
blaze2: Better than the first... I think it looks more realistic.<br />
iced blaze: That's pretty nifty!  I love the &quot;crystal-y&quot; effect.<br />
Kid's remix: I don't know what Jack's got against you... &lt;_&lt;  But the orangey colour still comes through sometimes (I suppose it's because of that &quot;bug&quot; in the original that captures a little rectangle and makes it move to the front of the screen... can't be helped, I assume?).  I can't praise you for it, since all you did was change the colour... :p<br />
campfire: Hehehe, that's cool, Viz...<br />
<br />
I didn't try out Atero's code yet... I'll have to see if it makes THAT much of a difference like Shock says.  Overall, great work!  Keep it up! :D<br />
<br />
And you and your snow can go to hell, Kid!  I live in Thunder Bay and all we have is -25 windchill!  Bastard! :)

 ! ! ! Welcome ! ! ! to AVS, when shit gets you down Go hard at braining out AVS code and when things are really Good, do it too. For me it's the times of the middle ground that leave me blank. Meloncoly (spelling?) is my worst enemy. Take your time tho, it wont happen over-night but it will happen, just persist and search the forums for previous help threads. Post when you cant find things in there first.<br />

		To make a single SSC cube - (I'm assuming that you know how to use 3-D, if not search forums and look at Atero's primer).<br />
Figure out coordinates for cube. Trace edges of cube(you will have to repeat some edges).<br />
Your pixel editbox will be something like the following:<br />
pt=pt+1; (don't forget to set pt to 0 in frame editbox)<br />
<br />
x=if(equal(pt,1),&lt;Insert coord&gt;,x);<br />
y=if(equal(pt,1),&lt;Insert coord&gt;,y);<br />
z=if(equal(pt,1),&lt;Insert coord&gt;,z);<br />
<br />
x=if(equal(pt,2),&lt;Insert coord&gt;,x);<br />

I gess i must learn more obout 3D ssc - ing.<br />
I get the method (spellind) of doing 3D ssc (shadow and the wall. U take random 3D object, U show light on it and here u go there is the kind 3D object on 2D wall, simple isnt it [heh dream on], its all i know but i dont figure out math how to do it in ssc).<br />

		jack the king: i said this in another thread, but i'll say it again here: <font size="4">USE THE DAMN EDIT BUTTON</font>.  Don't do double-posts like that, just use the edit button (right under the post) and change the post instead of making a new one.

:<br />
<br />
x2d=x3d/(cameradistance + scalefactor*z3d);<br />
y2d=y3d/(cameradistance + scalefactor*z3d);<br />
<br />
or, optimised:<br />
<br />
buffer=1/(cameradistance + scalefactor*z3d);<br />
x2d=x3d*buffer;<br />
y2d=y3d*buffer;<br />
<br />
<br />
obviously in avs x2d and y2d ar x and y. i just named the variables in a way that would allow me to explain it all without typing too much :p

		It causes posts like this to go onto 2 or more pages and can be really annoying when you have to see their avatar, signature and other stuff.  Editing the post makes it much easier to read it.
