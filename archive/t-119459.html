<div class="posttext">Just to explain the file a bit... <br />
<br />
It's kind of slow at higher resolutions since the number of dots increases exponentially. However to make the fire seem full I had to do this. <br />
<br />
Feel free to mess with the code to try and make it run faster, since I'm sure its not completely optimized. <br />
<br />
Also make sure that you are listening to some fairly loud music, since it is volume sensitive. At lower volumes it looks more like a candle than a blaze. <br />
<br />
Also you might want to turn off the BG effect to improve performance. Just turn the entire first effect list off and turn the [Main] -&gt; [Clear Every Frame] on for better results.<br />
<br />
Well, what do you think? :) <br />
:up: or :down: ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well this is kinda my remix of it :D:D<br />
It's the same thing but only as a blue flame.<br />
Maybe you might like it.:P<br />
I was trying to figure out maybe how to get orange on top pf the blue<br />
to kinda look like a Bunsen Burner Since i dont really understand super scope all that well i failed to do it lol<br />
Well maybe you should give what i just said a shot i think it would look freakin amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">How's about attaching the file you so vigorously advertized, kid? :p<br />
<br />
The fire effect is nice, but I'd make it turn off when the music stops (e.g. red=v; green=v; blue=v).  Also try making it a bit brighter...it's not really firey when it's that dull (color-wise).<br />
And you really don't need that buffer save...just set the two sub-effect lists in the second effect list to:<br />
ignore/replace<br />
additive/replace<br />
and get rid of those FPS-sucking buffer saves :) You can also turn off the clear every frame in the second effect list now (it's a minor speedup).<br />
<br />
Slightly sped up DM code:<br />
frame:<br />
t=t+0.2<br />
<br />
pixel:<br />
y=y+0.05+rand(256)*0.0004+0.01*sin(t+x*10);<br />
x=x*1.1+rand(256)*0.0002-0.025;<br />
That creates almost the exact same effect; the difference is hardly noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st December 2002, 03:49</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">OK, here's the update. <br />
<br />
Atero, thanks for pointing out that I don't need the effect lists. Also, I made the flame brighter, added a blur, and intruduced a simplistic particle &quot;engine&quot; to simulate flying embers. It's not really visible over the blur, though, so for the time I have only one particle set to be drawn. Just duplicate the N=1 effect list to see more, if you can make them out. Turn off the blur for a better look.<br />
<br />
I tried your suggestion for the DM, but it seemed like it cheapened the effect, no offense. I modified it a bit to try to improve performance (I don't know if it even made a defference though), but your change seemed to make it flow strangly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the help Atero, and thanks for the support Kid! I'd like to see your remix, by the way. Meanwhile, I'll try to achieve a blue flame effect as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st December 2002, 05:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">*eyebrow* As I said, that code produces almost exactly (and I mean, EXACTLY) the same effect.  The only difference is some round-offs.  The same code, without rounding:<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
t=t+0.2;<br />
<br />
pixel:<br />
y=y+0.05+rand(256)*0.000390625+0.01*sin(t+x*10);<br />
x=x*1.1+rand(256)*0.0001953125-0.025;<br />
<br />
The only thing I did was get rid of unneeded calculations - t is only used once in pixel, and it's a linear incrementation, so t*0.2 isn't needed; just change the frame statement to t=t+0.2 instead.  If I'm correct, the rand function prefers powers of 2, so I changed the two to rand(256).  I adjusted the down-scaling accordingly so that the range is the same...so on and so forth.  I just rounded those two numbers off because those last six digits weren't going to do much, and it takes another (minor) load off AVS's calculations.  Don't tell me speedups ;)<br />
<br />
And here's the problem with your embers: they're too small.  Use cfp's convolution filter, or unconed's texer to texture them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I give you... ICED BLAZE. <br />
<br />
Basicly, here are the differences between this and regular blaze:<br />
<br />
-BG effect list removed.<br />
-Blue unique effect.<br />
-Much faster fire superscope. (Uses lines instead of dots.)<br />
-Blue FyrewurX.<br />
-3D &quot;spiral base&quot; superscope.<br />
-Movement to give crystal effect.<br />
-Two dynamic movements to create circular motion and zoom (one before &quot;crystal&quot; movement, one after)<br />
-Buffer save and dynamic movement to create circular blur effect.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

 The blaze remix &lt;= Kid dont eaver try<br />
 The iced blaze &lt;== good but still i dont like it - Too fast jumps on beat , too fast(i must run it on full scr.). I'd like it if it would look like real ice cube (it tryed to make ssc like this but i failed....looks like goob job for UnConeD).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Awsome job Shock Value.<br />
<br />
I like the first on the best ... the Ice blaze is very very ... umm I find it very interesting I like the way it moves and the ice offset part on top of the flame. <br />
It's probably one of the best uses of the firewurkz plugin I've seen .... it looks like smashing bits of Ice. It should be called Icewurkz. All I can say to improve it, is to either slow or less sensitive the way it moves and have it as a part rather than a whole preset.  Thats just it though isn't it is just a development.<br />
<br />
Very impressed over all ... Have you been AVS'ng long ?? If not I have to say that Shock Value will be a great upand comming AVS'er.. I like your style.<br />
<br />
Hey Kid, Sssssscool man I like your version. I can definatly see what your going for I noticed it lookd better when the music was not close to peaking.. mabey turn down the audio spectrum detection..<br />

<div class="posttext">blaze1: Pretty decent.  Fire is tricky, no? :)<br />
blaze2: Better than the first... I think it looks more realistic.<br />
iced blaze: That's pretty nifty!  I love the &quot;crystal-y&quot; effect.<br />
Kid's remix: I don't know what Jack's got against you... &lt;_&lt;  But the orangey colour still comes through sometimes (I suppose it's because of that &quot;bug&quot; in the original that captures a little rectangle and makes it move to the front of the screen... can't be helped, I assume?).  I can't praise you for it, since all you did was change the colour... :p<br />
campfire: Hehehe, that's cool, Viz...<br />

I didn't try out Atero's code yet... I'll have to see if it makes THAT much of a difference like Shock says.  Overall, great work!  Keep it up! :D<br />

<div class="posttext">To make a single SSC cube - (I'm assuming that you know how to use 3-D, if not search forums and look at Atero's primer).<br />
Figure out coordinates for cube. Trace edges of cube(you will have to repeat some edges).<br />
Your pixel editbox will be something like the following:<br />
pt=pt+1; (don't forget to set pt to 0 in frame editbox)<br />
<br />
x=if(equal(pt,1),&lt;Insert coord&gt;,x);<br />
