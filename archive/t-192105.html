<div class="posttext">This has got to be my most colorful preset yet. Wanted top take something I started on a little while ago and (tried to) make it look better. After a few more presets I may have an AVS pack to post :)<br />
That is if I get any better...<br />
Oh well, here's my newset preset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd September 2004, 04:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I just made a few minor changes. Changed the colors, made them go to the music instead of just cycling them... Not much else.<br />
I really like the way the colors go together. It's really nice and relaxing (imo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd September 2004, 09:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I made all the superscopes colors respond to the music now. Even though it's a minor change I thought I would put it in another post.<br />
Could anyone tell me if it could be optimized in any way? It's still kind of hard for me to know what's optimized and not because I'm still a newb, but I'm learning!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">make more music reactive<br />
atm it's just an animation that has not much to do with the music<br />
add direction changes on beat or something<br />
<br />
the scopes are nice... did you do them yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd September 2004, 02:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes all the scopes are by me except for the first one, which was done by elvis from his 3D-superscopes pack. I took one and modified it slightly to look better for this preset.<br />
I will try to make it more beat responsive and add some changes in direction, it just that I'm still experimenting with AVS you know, finding out what looks good and what not to use- or use too much of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd September 2004, 05:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:up:Thanks man, I took your advice and made it change directions to the beat of the music. Now it doesn't get boring after a while ( :rolleyes: at least the first one was boring to me ). I replaced the normal movement with a dynamic movement. :)<br />
Actually, I'm rather pleased with how this one turned out. What does everyone else think? Any suggestions to make it more music responsive?<br />
<br />
Changed the coloring yet again, uploaded new file</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">My newest revision of this preset. I smoothed out some of the effects (I think that's what I did at least). The thing is I don't like the original name anymore.:cry: <br />
It really doesn't fit it now, the preset has kind of out grown the name you could say.<br />
<br />
I'm asking anyone if they have a better name to give it.<br />
To me it kind of looks like really colorful smoke/water or something. The colors remind me of pictures of nebulae or space gas that the Hubble space telescope revealed.:weird: <br />
I'd appreciate any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Lots of bass recommended for this one :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you have to credit people if you use their stuff<br />
otherwise it's a rip</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Um... I thought I did that. Ooops!:o <br />
I thought it was in the comment in the preset, but when I modified it I guess I changed it.<br />
Don't take me as someone who rips others work, that's not how I like to do things. If there were any misleadings of me doing the first ssc i apologize, man. For now on I'll try to be more clear. :)</div></div><hr />
