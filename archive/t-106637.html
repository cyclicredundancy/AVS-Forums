<div class="posttext">Okay, I've almost finished my 6th pack, it should be ready for release in about a week or so unless I'm feeling really lazy this week. I've got about four more presets to finish off then its done.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was hoping that some of you wonderful people might want to remix some of my work so that I can pick the best ones and cram them in my pack to size it up a bit and generally make it better. I always like packs with remixes in and I would like my pack even more if it contained remixes. Besides, I think that it is a good thing to do in the community.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I would like to know if I can do some remixes of your work too. I'm not sure who's stuff I want to fiddle with yet but I will ask the orignal authors permission to include them in my pack when I make some.<br />
<br />
You can get all of my presets from http://jheriko.deviantart.com if you want to make some remixes for me. Hopefully you won't think that any of them are too noobish, I've always tryed to be code heavy, even in my earlier presets.<br />
<br />
If you do make anything please post it up under this thread.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here be a double-fps version of ya glass cube.<br />
<br />
I also optimized the SSC's by reducing them to only ONE division per point, and only calculating sin and cos once per frame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thankyou Zevensoft.<br />
<br />
Here are some of my unreleased presets that will be in Pack VI, I basically chose four at random. This way I can keep most of Pack VI secret and still let everyone remix some of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i have a minor creative slump right now, so i don't know if i could do some remixes (that would be good), but you always remix my stuff, infact i alwya love it when someone remixes my stuff</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You know whats funny - I was going to ask you if I could remix your cubism preset to make the cubes have filled transparent faces.<br />
<br />
(Mainly because I've labelled myself in my own mind as the 'master of solid geometry in AVS' after releasing my platonic solids minipack :D)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm... my 'some of pack 6.zip' has been downloaded 6 times. Hopefully that means that i'll be seeing 6 remixes! Either that or people just want to see my work before it is properly released :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm thinkng about that swirly one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th September 2002, 13:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I've already forgotten which ones I put in the zip, but if it is Golden Spiral that you are talking about, then that is definately in dire need of remixing. I couldn't think of anything really cool to do with it and I still can't.<br />
<br />
It is nice to see that people are helping me out. I love the AVS community, and now it is starting to love me back.<br />
<br />
I couldn't be bothered to remix cubism in the end because the code was completely different to how i would usually do things, I would have had to remake the preset from scratch to do what I wanted to do, which really negates the point of remixes. So instead I ended up tinkering with frescati instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the remixes.<br />

My pack is starting to swell in size.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I created two remixes for you. They need the Convolution, Channel Sift and Multiplier APEs, but I trust you already have those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th September 2002, 17:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks for that skupers. i've done a remix of your endotherm preset, can i include it in my pack as well?? it is attached if you want to look at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
REALLY cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You could use some stuff from Rucksack if you want. It's pretty basic though. Is stuff from your other packs open to remixing too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2002, 18:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, anything that I have made is open to remixing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Check this out Jheriko!<br />
<br />
I think its uber-1337 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2002, 23:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks. I just finished optimising it a bit, almost doubled the fps. Most of that was down to my old superscope code being a bit cack, but I also optimised the added gray scopes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2002, 23:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Here, I'll upload it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Karnov</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2002, 23:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, i was worried about the FPS (can you repost it? i would like to see what you did, so i can learn)<br />
<br />
{edit: LOFREAKINL i juuuust missed that post! damn!<br />
<br />
Dang! that is a lot faster, nice job<br />
<br />
um, u might want to change the file name, its getting lengthy :)<br />
}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2002, 23:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Most of the changes that were responsible for fps increase were in my original superscope and was mostly taking things like cos(rz) in pixel and putting crz=cos(rz) in frame and then replacing the cos(rz) with crz. That way you calculate cos(rz) once per frame rather once per pixel.<br />
<br />
The other thing I did was to remove the effect list, place your scopes at the top then use Misc/Render Mode to fatten up the lines rather than using that filled rectangle method that you used (which although useful in other situation wasn't really appropriate here).</div></div><hr />

Large Version (1068x603 I think) (http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jheriko/Pack6.jpg)<br />
<br />
I've only got 2 more presets to finish now before I release the pack and one of them is very nearly done.<br />
<br />
There is also an attached, slightly lower quality, verson of the large image here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i forsee this getting quite a few +favs on www.deviantart.com<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
(ill be damned if i do not fav something i made :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th September 2002, 22:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks for that Karnov. I'm not really known enough yet to get that many favs though and I still haven't completely mastered several aspects of AVS (like the dynamic movement).<br />
<br />
After this pack is done I'm going to have to leave it a while before Pack VII, like three months or more, so that I can really get to grips with the full capabilities of AVS.<br />
<br />
I've still got two presets to finish :( one of them is practically finished though, the other one looks like I need to restart from scratch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The pack is almost completed now, I have 4 more superscopes to code, very complex superscopes though. I'm going to take a break and do them tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Pack VI will probably be released on Sunday unless I'm feeling real lazy or really motivated.<br />
<br />
Here's another screenshot from Pack VI to keep you all going untill sunday.<br />

It is 3d (in a fake sorta way) and looks almost as good as the real thing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">How on earth you did that? Too complex for me, i think i need to learn from you for SSCs...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">MaxPudding</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th September 2002, 13:22</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Damn, what english i used =) (broken english) Muahahaha!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th September 2002, 13:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I used a logarithmic spiral and the render/starfield. There aren't any SSCs in the preset.<br />
<br />
The movment code for that specific preset is:<br />
<br />
mphi=(1+sqrt(5))*0.38;<br />
r=r+log(mphi*d);d=d/mphi;<br />
<br />
The rest of the effect is the starfield, a multiplier and a couple of blurs. The final element is a DM which is used to change the 'view angle' and zoom.<br />
<br />
I need to get back to work, I still can't make my damn SSCs work for one of my presets (I'm |&lt;-&gt;| that close to giving up), I keep running out of variables, even after reloading the preset!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th September 2002, 13:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, I gave up. I'm going to release the pack TODAY!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh, i thought you used SSC for that particular preset =)<br />
<br />
Haha, i know what you talking about, is it the tank that suppose to shoot the bunker preset? What's that called agaiN? Damn, im at my cousin's house now, all the stuffs are in my pc back home!! =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th September 2002, 02:28</div></div>

<div class="posttext">yeah... i kept running out of variables :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, you can sacrifice speed for more variables, etc. removing sin/cos from per frame and putting them in per point, using red/green/blue for variables. And don't use a variable called 'ch', For some unknown reason AVS doesn't let you assign anything to it, and will cause the superscope to not render at all basically. Try it, put 'ch=ch;' into a ssc or dm and watch it fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th September 2002, 12:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Damn, I should of thought of that, it wouldn't have been to much of a slowdown on a 8 point superscope.</div></div><hr />
