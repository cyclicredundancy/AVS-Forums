See attached preset, Here's a screenshot (http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/8039/clipboard01lq.png) for comparing reasons.<br />
<br />
Someone wants to run AVS on a 50x10 LED display and wanted suggestions as for which presets to use.<br />
<br />
For that purpouse, I made this mosaic-like filter that would create a 50x10 grid to put at the bottom of a preset. (I omitted the y-axis for testing reasons.)<br />
<br />
What happens, is that everything between x=.12 and x=0, x=0 and 0.4, and x=-0.4 and x=-0.8 are bundeled.<br />
<br />
Does this only happen on my machine? If not, does anyone have a suggestion? Is my code faulty?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i have no idea, but i have to say i kinda like that preset. remove that white line, make it much slower and maybe some random mirrors :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">All the colors are created by the Colorfade and the Water filter (basically my default testing background). I slowed it a bit down but the Colorfade isn't really tunable in the way I'd really wish. The step-size of the sliders isn't big enough for this use.<br />
<br />
Disabling the second EL significantly boosts the FPS<br />
<br />
Added some other crap too. Enjoy it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">love that second version, man! the first version created an urge to play super mario kart on the snes :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Your code looks correct (if a bit silly, all those if function calls), but its easy to slip up with huge statements like these.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend something that actually rounds all x's to the nearest 0.04 or whatever... but thats not really the best way to do a mosaic either. Something like x=floor(x*25)/25; should do the trick though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I guessed there would be a better solution, but lazy as I am I went for the straightforward option. <br />
I tested it your method, and it works fine if you use<br />
<br />
x=floor(x*25)*.04;<br />
y=floor(y*5)*.2<br />
<br />
That fixes the problem for testing presets for a LED display, but I'm still wondering what could cause the shown behaviour in the first version.<br />
<br />
Ah, well.. there are more (important) bugs in AVS.<br />
<br />
Thanks, J</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I took a fresh look at the code and managed to spot the problem:<br />
<br />
if(above(x,.8),.10,<br />
if(above(x,.4),.6,<br />
if(above(x,0),.2,<br />
if(above(x,-.4),-.2,<br />
if(above(x,-.8),-.6,<br />
<br />
.6 should be .06, .2 should be .02, etc...<br />
<br />
Classic. Its always these kinds of mistakes which are hardest to debug. I scanned over that bit of code at least four times before I realised this...<br />
<br />
If it makes you feel any better I spent three hours at work a couple of weeks ago debugging something which was just missing a &quot;!&quot; (not) from a boolean condition. Its not the first time thats happened to me either...<br />
<br />
There is a lesson here though, don't write really long code where a couple of lines suffice - it increases the probability of human errors slipping in. Although I guess it doesn't help much if you don't know the rounding &quot;trick&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:o ... I can't count.<br />
<br />
Thanks for finding it.<br />
These are, indeed, the hardest to find.<br />
<br />
The positive side here: The preset above looks like crap with a correct Movement. :)</div></div><hr />
