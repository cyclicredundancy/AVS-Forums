No, really, you don't. Having written articles for the front page on numerous occasions, the sheer volume of hate mail you can get from it really isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
The fucking flak I took for reviewing the Butthole Surfers album :cry: <br />
<br />
Still, I could always write you a &quot;Aussie mod in AVS gay orgy scandal&quot; , or something,if you really like :p<br />
<br />

/hmmm, been a while.... goes to write.......</div></div><hr />

i thought it's common knowledge that its the biggest mistake to use your real email-address here on winamp.com. i assume that due to its popularity some &quot;spam-companies&quot; scan the site for email-addresses. <br />
<br />
why i am assuming this?<br />
<br />
i had the suspicion when i first uploaded my winamp skins back in 1998. later when winamp 2 came out, i had to re-register myself, since the old account was gone. this time i god myself an email just for the purpose of uploading avs to winamp.com. shortly after (1 or 2 weeks) i was already flooded with spam (the regular enlarge your penis, make money, meet women etc stuff). remember, i only used the email for winamp.com.<br />
<br />
i notified the staff long time ago, back then they said there was no proof for a direct connection. well, that's not true. emails where addressed to the nick i'm using on winamp.com, the subject where in part related to winamp.com and even worse: one a first glance the senders looked like other avs people (jheriko, tuggummi etc). it turned out, the emails are not from them, but just another result of the winamp.com scan.<br />
<br />
sad but true :down:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually the amount of real spam is nothing compared to the amount of clueless people :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank god I only published my first pack over at Winamp.com...<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I won't exactly be able to access my mailbox...<br />
<br />
Yay for AVS!!!<br />
Let's just hope they don't continue their coverage over to Devart... I'm guessing a filled mailbox (Read : 1 meg+ per mailcheck) for a good amount of us if that happens...<br />
<br />
As for now, let's expect a &quot;few&quot; more newbies coming in here...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First, the winamp main page, then the world!<br />
<br />
&amp; why wasn't I mentioned?  oh well, soiamrebornagain does appear in that featured component box after all, can't really complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th April 2003, 08:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Shouldn't have to worry about devart though, remember they're attitude towards AOL. Suprised they even support AVS considering winamp.com is basically owned by AOL.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hehe, i always hope that my name will get mentioned on a list like that, but then i remember that i never really post anything that i make :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th April 2003, 10:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i also changed my email add to a bogus one a while ago, i used to get even responses to &quot;my mails&quot; that &quot;i&quot; have sent to some people... Stuff just like &quot;So cool a flash, check it out&quot; &quot;Hentai XXX girls nude&quot; :p<br />
<br />
Also i get a lot of emails from &quot;Unconed&quot; &quot;Jheriko&quot; &quot;Danjoe&quot; &quot;Blazer&quot; etc... :D<br />
<br />
Why can't winamp.com have a option to hide the email from public? Because i would still like get notified when a new pack has been reviewed... And also if i forgot my password how the hell im going to retrieve it if i have a address like &quot;diespammer@sikanauta.com&quot; :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've had the same hotmail adress for over a year and i get at least 40 or 50 spam e-mails a day. I've got the junk mail fileter on high though so it narrows it down to about 30 a day. I've got really good at figuring out whch ones are spam. and i get about 1 worth reading every couple of days. Fucking nightmare. And you're telling me it'll get worse when i release presets. /me goes off to create new e-mail address.</div></div><hr />
