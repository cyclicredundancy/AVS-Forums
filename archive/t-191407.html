      This preset is a modified version of the first preset I posted. If anyone out there loves looking at fire, I suggest this one to you. I'd really like to know what everyone thinks of it. Any hints, tips, or other help is also appreciated.<br />
      I mess around with AVS when I find time, which isn't that often, but I think I'm figuring it out alright. Most of the time I just end up typing in random expressions and see what happens. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">you seriously need to optimize that!<br />
      for example:<br />
      you use an effect list with input=multiply as the first component inside an effect list with clear screen enabled.<br />
      multiply is not a very cheap filter, and you might as well activate clear screen on the inner effect list and set its input mode to Ignore.<br />
      <br />
      here's some useless filters :)<br />
      the first parameter is always the current screen while the second parameter is the effect list content.<br />
      0 means that current screen is completely black.<br />
      These combinations can be substituted by "Replace" blending:<br />
      xor(0,something)=something<br />
      maximum(0,something)=something<br />
      subtractive2(0,something)=something<br />
      additive(0,something)=something<br />
      <br />
      These combinations can be substituted by blend mode=ignore+ a clear screen:<br />
      subtractive1(0,something)=0<br />
      minimum(0,something)=0<br />
      multiply(0,something)=0</p>

      <p class="post-content">here's the "filter-optimized" version ;)<br />
      i also added a first frame only clear screen to light grey to make it less flickery in the first seconds</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the help, the fps has dramatically increased.:up:<br />
      <br />
      I guess I didn't realize what I was doing with the multiply and xoring, way too extraneous, huh.<br />
      Anyway I messed with it a little so here is it now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">this one is too flickery imo...<br />
      flickery things are bad for the eyes, which is why most ppl dont like them<br />
      <br />
      also, you used a convolution filter with a scaling of 15.<br />
      use scalings of 1 2 4 8 16 32 and so on for best performance</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, made this thing much better. I fixed the convo filter, using a scaling of 16 as TommyLobo mentioned. ;) I then cut down the flickering as much as possible, so as not to strain the eyes. Also, I added a superscope (pulsar) thanks to Elvis' 3D superscopes package.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is a LOT better. It's actually rather nice now, like a particularly peppy sunflower.</p>
