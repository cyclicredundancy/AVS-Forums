<div class="posttext">This thing has been bothering me for a while now. Althought the code is really simple, something is wrong.<br />

n=w;<br />
drawmode=1;<br />
s=0.5;<br />
<br />
<br />
Pixel<br />

<div class="posttext">(I take you mean x=i-.5; instead of x=0 for your example?)<br />
<br />
It has to do with how the lines are drawn since there's only a one-pixel shift for 2 points.<br />
<br />
I always use n=w+2 (or n=w*2+2 for fullscreen). This makes it one pixel wider, but it fixes the problem and noone will notice</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I ment x=i-0.5;. <br />
<br />
It never hit me that n=w+2; would solve it. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't know why it works either, but it does</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you could always just use n=2, x=i-0.5 and mega fat linesize.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The reason this happens is quite obvious if you step through the code. x = i - .5 means that for each point it will be a little further across in the x-axis. with your s = -s you are alternating successive points between s and -s in the y axis. putting the two together creates a zig-zag, sawtooth wave... whatever you want to call it. by using the (pretty wasteful i might add) n = w you are creating one which is so dense that it appears to be a solid rectangle. <br />
<br />
by convenience n = w is the exact amount needed for it to break down like this since you are covering half the width of the screen with w/2 points per side of rectangle. e.g. each subsequent point is so close on the x axis that the point moves one pixel to the left for every two points evaluated. the only reason for it to not look perfect is rounding errors, since the n = w/2 means each point is half a pixel infront of the other. n = w+2 pushes it past the magic point of w/2 and so there is no chance of a visible artefact from a rounding error. such artefacts are still there but the zig-zag is so dense that they always get drawn over.<br />
<br />
a better way to do this is to work out a single pixel width per frame then, still using s = -s for y, incrementing x manually with this width only when s is +ve or -ve (which ever you choose will probably not matter) you can then skip redundant lines too.<br />
<br />
per frame:<br />
ix = .5/w<br />
xi = -.5<br />
<br />
per point:<br />
s=-s;<br />
xi = if(above(s,0),xi + ix,xi);<br />
x = xi;<br />
y = s;<br />
<br />
(untested since i am at work)<br />
<br />
an even better way to draw a solid rectangle is with triangle.ape :P</div></div><hr />
