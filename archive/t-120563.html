      <p class="post-content"><strong>downloading presets - no good</strong><br />
      Trying to figure out what I can possibly be doing wrong here...<br />
      <br />
      Every preset I download is nothing but a white spectrum analyser on a black background, which doesn't refresh. What the hell?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Dunno. Something with avs_vis.dat maybe? It stores AVS data from the preset that was playing when AVS was last closed.<br />
      <br />
      If you get desparate, try a re-install.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Major dude... So you have been a lot in the forums, but are you new to avs? I sure hope you know how to switch between presets :D<br />
      <br />
      ehm... Im now going to assume you are a total new user for avs... So to switch between avs presets just right click on the avs window and select a preset you want to view. Also you can use Y &amp; U to switch between previous &amp; next preset.<br />
      <br />
      uhmm... i hope im not making an ass out of myself now :D</p>

      <br />
      Well, i don't know, but why it always seems that people are trying to find the most hard way to fix the problem when it could be something as simple as not knowing how to use AVS :p<br />
      <br />
      Well i guess my face should be red now, but i just wanted to help and i shouldn't be ashamed by that :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tend to assume a problem is an actual problem, not not knowing what to do. I assume people do what I do and hit all the keys to find out what they do.<br />

      Am I the only one that does this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I can switch between presets =]<br />
      <br />
      It only happens with presets I've downloaded - the things that come with winamp work okay. Happens with many things I've downloaded - both off these forums, and in preset packs.<br />
      <br />
      Tried deleteing vis_avs.dat - no change.<br />
      <br />
      don't want to use AVS enough to actually do a reinstall - just curious.<br />

      <p class="post-content">What version of AVS do you have? 2.5 (Winamp2) and 2.5.1 (Winamp3) are the most recent ones.</p>

      <p class="post-content">2.5, apparently<br />

      If anyone has any bright ideas, I'm all ears. Otherwise, I'll try again when I next format my hd<br />
