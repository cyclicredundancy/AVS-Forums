<div class="posttext">Trying to figure out what I can possibly be doing wrong here...<br />
<br />
Every preset I download is nothing but a white spectrum analyser on a black background, which doesn't refresh. What the hell?<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Dunno. Something with avs_vis.dat maybe? It stores AVS data from the preset that was playing when AVS was last closed.<br />
<br />
If you get desparate, try a re-install.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Extremely odd; the jist of Jaheckelsafar's post was: delete vis_avs.dat (not vis_avs.dll!) and try again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Major dude... So you have been a lot in the forums, but are you new to avs? I sure hope you know how to switch between presets :D<br />
<br />
ehm... Im now going to assume you are a total new user for avs... So to switch between avs presets just right click on the avs window and select a preset you want to view. Also you can use Y &amp; U to switch between previous &amp; next preset.<br />
<br />
uhmm... i hope im not making an ass out of myself now :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Killahbite, i thought i recongized that nick from somewhere... (iik now i confessed i have surfed the milkdrop forums! OH NO! :blah: :D)<br />
<br />
Well, i don't know, but why it always seems that people are trying to find the most hard way to fix the problem when it could be something as simple as not knowing how to use AVS :p<br />
<br />
Well i guess my face should be red now, but i just wanted to help and i shouldn't be ashamed by that :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I tend to assume a problem is an actual problem, not not knowing what to do. I assume people do what I do and hit all the keys to find out what they do.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that does this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I can switch between presets =]<br />
<br />
It only happens with presets I've downloaded - the things that come with winamp work okay. Happens with many things I've downloaded - both off these forums, and in preset packs.<br />
<br />
Tried deleteing vis_avs.dat - no change.<br />
<br />
don't want to use AVS enough to actually do a reinstall - just curious.<br />

<div class="posttext">What version of AVS do you have? 2.5 (Winamp2) and 2.5.1 (Winamp3) are the most recent ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Krash</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th January 2003, 10:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">2.5, apparently<br />
<br />
If anyone has any bright ideas, I'm all ears. Otherwise, I'll try again when I next format my hd<br />
