      ^(Preset "Cube Lake" in above .zip)^<br />
      <br />
      The cube itself is handled by 24 megabuf entries used in init, then swapping between point and line mode to draw the 12 segments. I've had one problem; it seems to only work with n=26 or greater(when it should be 25) but other than that it works fine.<br />
      <br />
      Now, the question here is, "Is this the best way to do this"? There's no actual way to draw the cube in one solid line, but 5 boxes could do the job(at a waste of 8 lines).<br />
      <br />
      Also, I've got a question about the rotations. First off, when I attempted to put them in as a single statement, they didn't work properly, so I did the stepwise version there.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, any general comments about that or the others in that file? There's a newer version of Spiradelic in the zip as well.</p>

      bzzzzpt wrong! How many times do I have to tell you people, you can make ANYTHING with one scope.</p>

      </blockquote>no point to use megabuffer (array), its quite a slow, you can do wireframe cubes with faster methods and using multiple superscopes.<br />

      </blockquote>I suggest you to /google or /mathworld or /wiki. Stuff that works in math works in avs aswell.<br />
      Imho you'r doing the rotation in correct way, you dont have to use rotation matrices.<br />
      <br />
      Your math seems quite fine, try more to concentrate on aesthetical side of presets, ofcourse if you just want to toy around with 3D, no one forces you :).<br />
      If you want some preset examples (solid wireframe ;), bezier etc.) and relatevely simple math check my Deviantart account (link in signature).

      <p class="post-content">Toplogically there's no way to draw a cube with a single line <i>without overlaps</i>. (Shoulda said that first.) I had a diagram done out, It can't be done with any less than 16 lines or something like that. Which is only a waste of 4 lines, really, but it's still a waste.</p>

      <p class="post-content">use 'skip' for overlaps, or connections... you cant do it with exactly 13 points (the mathematical minimum) but the additional lines required are an infinitessimal performance hit.</p>
