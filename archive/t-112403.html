      I know that that card shouldn't give any problems, perhaps it could be that Winamp can't handle the 64K colours (which i refuse to believe), but who knows... Try setting colors to 32k and try again...<br />

      we all know that Atero is an asshole when it comes to speaking proper, non-offending english, we get used to it, end of question.<br />
      <br />
      mentioning that to him will only give him an even bigger ego and he will only start using even more and ruder words, that's just the kid he is: the more you warn him to do <b>not</b> do something, the harder he tries to do just that...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for your insulting, demeaning, unbased and blatantly incorrect explanation of my views on ettiquitte, rattaplan. I really appreciated it.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not one of these people who's 'out there to beat everybody up' that just want's to get a response out of people. My biggest pet peeve is when people are being blissfully ignorant to the world around them and nobody is doing anything about it. I try to do something about it, and then I get assholes like you trying to make themselves look good by using me as an example, so to speak, of something they made up entirely in their own minds. I could spend two full hours on that subject, but I'm not going to because my time is infinitly more valuable when spent clipping my toenails than trying to explain something to someone I don't even have to deal with regularly.<br />
      <br />
      FYI: My original post was simply to notify nobady of the fact that his posting habits are not generally accepted in the majority of on-line forums (trust me, I surf a lot of message boards, I'm not the only one). If that's a completely bad thing to do then I'm sorry, and I'm leaving cos I don't want to live in a world where constructive critisism gets you shunned from the community. How the fuck was I bitching him off in my post in the first place?<br />
      <br />
      Finally I'd just like to say my life's been pretty shitty the past few weeks, so I'd just like to ask that you guys fuck off for a while...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Question: Why is it okay for you to offend me, but not okay for me to offend you?<br />
      I don't like people telling me how to talk; besides that, it's just a god damn word, there's no reason to get so upset about it. The words themselves mean absolutely nothing - it's a sound, nothing else. If it's the actual symbolism of an idea behind the word that you're worrying about, the same symbolism applies to 'frick' and 'fudge' when used in context. I could say the word 'the' offends me and that everyone in this room should't ever use it ever again becaus it's offensive. See how absurd that is?</p>

      <p class="post-content">First: sorry to have offended you.<br />
      <br />
      but as a matter of fact, when you read through the forums, you are only one of the very few who offend people on a regular basis, not that i mind if they deserve it, i guess i deserved yours now...<br />
      <br />
      Second: Personally, i don't give a fuck about saying fuck, but others feel offended by it. Don't know why, but it's the <b>majority</b> of the people around (i guess). Therefore i adjust to them.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">rattaplan, you're a fucking dick. just because the majority of people are christians doesn't mean i have to be a christian too. i'm not adjusting to something that's not right just because everyone else does it.<br />
      <br />
      and do you really think i regularly try to be offensive? it's not my problem if 99% of the people in this world are ignorant, arrogant, moronic pricks. i see myself as an incredibly enlightened person, and i really hate it when someone does something slightly (and this is just a generalization) wrong, that's just the way i am, and since a few of you are that 99% of the population, i get really pissed sometimes. then i make really offensive posts, like this one. but it's not like i'm trying to get a reaction out of you just to boost my ego. i'm above that - but you, rattaplan, are obviously not; you're doing the exact same thing you're accusing me of doing, just on a different route.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Okay, as i said, i deserved that..<br />
      <br />
      The difference between us is that i adjust to my surrounding, you don't. i can't disallow you to have an own opinion, don't want to either.<br />
      I just don't agree with it. So we're different. That's all I have to say.<br />

      </blockquote>Did you try the 32-bit colors thing?<br />
      <br />
      Obviously you have a rare technical problem and I think we've exhausted all options.<br />
      <br />
      Btw your sentence should be:<br />
      "And still there is nobody <u>who can</u> solve my problem."<br />
      Don't use dutch phonetics because they don't match at all.

      <p class="post-content">We ozstrayun's dun waste time wif stupid "ebonics" an' "phonetics". We jus' say wha we hear. It's prolly the fastest way of sayin' summin', considerin' that it prolly trains the brain to use the audible detection part for speech too.<br />
