      <p class="post-content"><strong>Problems with Express 6.0 and higher running under Windows XP</strong><br />
      I am migrating from Windows 2000 to Windows XP.<br />
      With the WinXP laptop (a Dell with a Mobility Radeon 7500C grapics card) AVSExpress 6.0 has a problem with the Colour Map Editor (CME)as used in the AVS Example. The graphics interface of the CME has many display errors and is inactive.<br />
      <br />
      The problem does not occur under Windows 2000 on a three year old Toshiba laptop.<br />
      <br />
      Does any one know of other problems under Windows XP.<br />
      Is the CME problem fixed in AVS Express6.1?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have answered my own question - got and installed Express6.1 in which the error with the CME has been corrected.<br />
      <br />
      However I still do have projects that work under Win2000 but part fail under WinXP.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think you've ended up in a wrong forum.<br />
      Yes, this is about AVS, but AVS as in Advanced Visualizations Studio.<br />
      There is no AVS Express that I've heard of, and no standard AVS example, although we have a ColorMap (but no external editor apart form the standard AVS editor).<br />
      <br />
      Or am I wrong? Someone help me out here..</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're right as far as I know. This is definitely the wrong forum the way I see things. AVSExpress 6.0? Never heard of.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wrong 'AVS'. This is about AVS the music visualisation plug-in for Winamp. Nothing scientific at all.</p>
