      An effect I created using color clipping/mapping to create a cyclic density plot...not really a preset, but I can't figure out what to do with it :p<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; fixed the attachment :) &lt;/edit&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">atero: still the reigning master of avs's 'simple tools', no one uses a conv and a color map like you can, among many other things.. very nice, similar idea to those cartoon presets, like, cartoonist dream and cartoon trip. Although used a different method to both.<br />
      <br />
      with a crazy tripped out dm you could make a nice effect, of corse that has been done before.<br />
      <br />
      what would be really cool is if you could somehow custom color the levels, so each height contour is a diferent colour for each level. this would be quite hard though i imagin.<br />
      but you are the color clip master, so ill leave you to decide.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks :D<br />
      here's a simple way of doing it, but it's kind of limiting:</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can use a colormap with regular bands to get an outline effect too (though not as sharp)...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Played with it a bit... the trails left by the MPs are pretty smooth. I assume it's a pit-potential field or something, coupled with sound/onbeat acceleration changes (as far as I can see).<br />
      <br />
      It looks really cool in the beginning when the particles all follow the same motion and then slowly scatter out. Would be cool if you could make your own group of dotscope that has the same behavior, and occasionally regroups back into one stream.<br />
      Could be done by taking a regular MP clone and tracking two particles: one locally random and one globally (getosc based). Then at random intervals, you interpolate towards the global point rather than the local one (best using a smooth interpolation curve such as "3t^2 - 2t^3").</p>

      <p class="post-content">yah, might be worth doing..<br />
      <br />
      that preset went all white for me a lot, i cant work out why, but i played around and it doesnt do it now..<br />
      <br />
      alternatively to your method, you could just set up an ordinary path for all of the particles to follow and make them individually seperate by different spec channels, that way they would move back together as the music stops.</p>

      <p class="post-content">geh...it's not cyclic anymore; now it's just texered moving particles with trails... :/</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, its hardly anything to do with your preset, and therfore the thread topic, but i still like it.</p>
