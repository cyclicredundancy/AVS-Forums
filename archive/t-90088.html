      <p class="post-content"><strong>resolution improvement?</strong><br />
      Is there any way to improve the resolution that i can get on fullscreen mode? i thought i had a pretty good video card (ATI Radeon 64 MB DDR) but i can barely get a smooth framrate @ 400 X 300 32Bpp resolution. got any tips to improve this without sacrificing framrates? all of your help is appreciated!!!:igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, no can do with AVS. AVS don't give a whack what video card you have. There's no impressing it. :)<br />
      <br />
      AVS is slow at high-res by nature. (unfortunately)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>results in lower res</strong><br />
      With pixel doubling you're essetially halving the resolution. 640x480 doubled is 320x240. It results in a lower res, but you can put it on your TV. :D</p>

      <br />
      Seriously, u could try the "fullscreen overlay mode" it might help.<br />
      Also using Doublepixel and 2x the rez seems to be faster...<br />
      so, i recommend running it at 800x600x32 with doublepixel ON insted of 400x300x32 with doublepixel OFF...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>xp processors</strong><br />
      does having an XP processor really make that big of a difference? I had just purchased a 1.8 ghz amd athlon xp (haven't received it yet) and I plan on using it for live performances. If it helps that much, then I think I made a good purchase.</p>
