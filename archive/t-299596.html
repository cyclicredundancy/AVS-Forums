      <p class="post-content"><strong>Output to LED plugin</strong><br />
      Ok, had a thought and want to do this project. But i downloaded the SDK and looked over some of the examples and am a bit overwhelmed.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to basically make a color organ of sorts. Or even just an LED VU. I have an amount of circuit knowledge and a bit of C++ in me. I just need a bit of help.<br />
      <br />
      I have a microcontroller that i am going to use on COM1 and it will control some LEDs. I just need a way for winamp to tell the LEDs what to do. I have not written the code for the microcontroller yet so that is all open for change still.<br />
      <br />
      Any insight that you can offer would be appreciated, i only ask that if you post code, you do some commenting on it in case i want to modify it later.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a ton</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Simple Spectrum Analyzer</strong><br />
      Ok, i got alot of this figured out. But i just need a little bit more to work with.<br />
      <br />
      I looked at the vis plugin in the SDK. It has the 3 modes/modules.<br />
      <br />
      I am wondering, what functions does winamp call in a plugin? What information in passed? what data is in the waveData and spectrumData arrays?</p>
