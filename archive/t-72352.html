      Whenever I put an AVI in an AVS, it tends to crash.... What's wrong?<br />
      <br />
      Is it just my problem?</p>

      AVS crashing? I have never had an AVS crash on my desktop before, but it most definitely sounds like a hardware or video problem.<br />
      <br />
      I can't help ya much, other than maybe you should try uninstalling and re-installing WinAmp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Uninstalling or reinstalling Winamp won't help much I think, because the AVI renderer uses Windows' built-in functions for avi's. Some ideas:<br />
      <br />
      - Install the latest version of media player<br />
      - Install the latest version of directx (maybe?)<br />
      <br />
      What OS/system are you running? Do you know what codec the avi was made in?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm running Windows 98, and I don't really know what CODEC my AVI's use. Maybe it's because I have it running in Hardware Mode or something? (if possible). It's a real pain...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS/AVI Crash</strong><br />
      I noticed that mine was doing the same thing (I was using old effects of AVS pre-inclusion with the Winamp download, though so I thought it was that). Anyway, I learned a trick to keep it from crashing. When you want to switch AVI files (which is what crashes it for me), remove the AVI loader from your menu and then reload it, select the new file, and it'll run. Switching between AVI files will crash Winamp pretty easily on my computer, hope that helps.</p>
