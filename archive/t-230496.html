<div class="posttext">You may remember me aways back from 2 skins (Venom and M3) I asked you guys to help with and were complete sucesses-Venom presets and Matrixd Presets Here (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/browse.php?search=yes&amp;filter=C&amp;query=matrixd). Well I have another skin that needs pro help from you Gods in here. This is SkinConsortiums new skin Vortex .  I want to make a PaK of presets that Has only Vortex Space type of stuff- Geographic Lines, Spheres, Worm Holes Spinning,---  Anything to do with Geometry Lines Color and Cool Spinning beat kicking AVS. Please Help ! List your stuff in this thread ,All credit goes to the authors, and the AVS pak will be released with the skin.  on winamp and Skinconsortium.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK any old stuff that any of you have that could go into this pak would be nice. you guys remeber the old Sonique vis with the spinning wormhole that sucks in the stars as it travels through space,  is that possible in AVS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">here's an older one from me...<br />
dunno if it's exactly what you were looking for. also I'm currently into reworking the camera movement and scopes, so maybe in a few days/weeks there could be a better, new version!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">QuadHeliX</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th November 2005, 20:09</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Hey hope you dont mind but I did a remix combining pak9's starfield and tweaked your wormhole here is what i got.  Grandchild one question how do I change the color of the wormhole to a rotating color scheme purple blue ect..?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th November 2005, 16:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah i also think that this starfield fits a bit better to that preset. But what i don't like is that the x-rotation of the new starfield is in opposite to the rotation of the wormhole. I think it'd be much better when they rotated the same way along all three axes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Grandchild</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th November 2005, 17:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm...<br />
pak's starfield is definitely better than mine, but do you really want that texer-light-point to stay there in the middle?? it looks a bit odd.<br />
And same with the rotation like ^..^ said.<br />
set &quot;croty&quot; to -reg03 in pak's starfield, that should solve that.<br />
for the color look into the pixel box of the body scopes. there is the lighting [named &quot;col&quot;], and the red, blue and green values which all three take up the &quot;col&quot; value, whereas red is modified by the current distance of the point from the center &quot;d&quot;.<br />
To change the colors, just create a global variable for red, blue and green. delete all the body scopes but one. make your changes by modifying red, blue and green and duplicate the scope until you have the desired amount of them. no individual scope setting needed. the position increment is already in the scopes.<br />

<div class="posttext">ok i changed the color,  now how do i change those spiny things that go down the throat to dots with spines instead of lines with spines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here is what I made I also added El-vis Shooting comets,  Hopefully I will get permission to from these artists to use there superscope work.  Anyway Can any one please in any way make this better and post there finished product here .http://www.choosewise.com/vortavs2.jpg</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh man! you screwed up my global code a little:<br />
I readded &quot;speed = (gettime(0)-t)*20;&quot; to the 1st line,<br />
and &quot;hw = h+w;&quot; to the 3rd line<br />
of the global SSC because they keep the speed fps-independent and the linesize somewhat resolution-independent. If you want thinner lines modify &quot;reg97&quot; labelled &quot;// tube linesize offset&quot; and/or &quot;reg95&quot; for the thingies<br />
<br />
also there were some empty bulges going through because you [accidentally?] deleted 2 thingy SSCs. fixed that now.<br />
<br />
Otherwise cool edits so far! I'll make it better beyond nagging on mistakes really soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this is nice i will have a couple versions of this in the pak!<br />

what do i have to do to add dots instead of those spiny things that go down the middle of the wormhole?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK this will be the only Preset and it will be a direct download from the skin on a special interface.  I just wanted to get this preset perfect.  can you tell me how to make the spiny things that go down the middle turn into dots or tiny balls?  And also how do I make the color of the worm hole change on userinput?<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">all right, your welcome!<br />
thanks from my side too, for helping me find yet a better version of this preset.<br />
<br />
and sorry for keeping you busy: But I polished up the code up a bit more [esp. pak's starfield, now it pauses along with the rest on pausing the music] AAAAAAND added a code-internal color modification right in the beginning of the global scope's frame box [labelled accordingly] which can adjust both the light color and the warphole color!<br />
<br />
my current coloring is:<br />
reg41 = 1;   reg42 = .5;<br />
reg43 = 1;   reg44 = .7;<br />
reg45 = .3;  reg46 = .5;<br />
<br />
the old plain purple coloring is:<br />
reg41 = 1;   reg42 = .5;<br />
reg43 = 1;   reg44 = .7;<br />
reg45 = 1;  reg46 = .5;<br />
<br />
maybe you can advise the user to access this possibility. not very userfriendly let alone dumbass-proof but better than nothing i think.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that's nice ASD5A!<br />
I thought about two vertical lines for hue and sat on each side. one side [á 2 lines/drawers/selectors] for the light color, one for the warphole color. just what i thought I'd do and since it's mine, maybe you could do it like that? :) I mean you definitely don't have to do it that way, just as a proposal...<br />
I tried to excerpt the hue/sat to RGB converting algos myself from &quot;stringtheory&quot; but couldn't. [btw have you received my remixes???]</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks! <br />
<br />
ps do you think you can do something with the geoballs that flow thru it? That would complete the AVS nicely.<br />
smaller color whatever....<br />
sorry for being picky but this is far more than i expected and we might as well make it perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">customer's king ;) so what do you want, I could offer either:<br />
- smaller,<br />
- lenghthened,<br />
- shortened,<br />
- size oscilloscope reactive balls, or<br />
- balls that are oscilloscopes itself [jittering a bit to sound input],<br />
- a different color,<br />
- flashy colors,<br />
- morphing colors,<br />
- no user color [sorry but that would mean another two bars, and imo cramming up the preset to much],<br />
- a color according to the wormhole<br />
<br />
pick some of these, it's all done in a minute.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, I said 1/2 an hour, but in the end it turned out to be 5 of them ;) [since our band-rehearsal didn't take place], and this makes 5 AVS-seconds, you know!<br />
<br />
so here it is, let's move on to the<br />
<br />
changes:<br />
- removed useless EL's,<br />
- changed name to &quot;Vortex&quot; [I think that's the name you wanted QuadHelix?] and mentioned ASD there,<br />
- moved onscreen check in global SSC [you hid that reg51 well, asd! I had to find it with the help of a text editor search! ts,ts, somewhere in the 3d rotation in the global code at the end of a line... :)],<br />
- moved both global hsl to rgb trans to the end of the global SSC's frame box,<br />
- added strg -&gt; interface on/off function [for better fullscreen looks],<br />
- added random color combo on init,<br />
- added shift -&gt; random color combo,<br />
- added right mouse button support,<br />
- added [tip from hboy] reassigning regs in the frame box before the use in the px-box [only body SSCs], minor speedup,<br />
- added weird code joke in the TexerII ;),<br />
- interface has the same relative size on all widths now,<br />
- interface speedup: SSC's and TexerII have n=0 when interface not visible,<br />
- modified beat balls [hopefully to your satisfaction, QuadHelix though w/o morphing colors [better imho]],<br />
- aspect ratio correction is now the same in the wormhole and the starfield,<br />
- changed comment a bit [added credits &amp; explanations],<br />
- labelled which code is whose [loosely],<br />
- selected colors are displayed on the wormhole now!!! according to this weird matrix:<br />
r = 1-r;<br />
g = 1-b;<br />
b = 1-g;<br />
to be found in the global SSC's hsl to rgb trans code [both times!]<br />
<br />
what I did not change:<br />
- the camera movement still sucks.<br />
<br />
I didn't make it an .exe since ASD5A might want to add something [although I don't think so since I think it's, err... &lt;understatement&gt;<br />
 quite nice! <br />
&lt;/understatement&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
hope you're pleased too,<br />

now all we have to do is pak it in exe if one of you can do that for me i would be happy.<br />

<div class="posttext">thx asd, it's been nice from my side too :)!<br />
<br />
but wasn't that the discussion on #avs? if it's hsb or hsl?<br />
<br />
/me wikis...<br />
<br />
oh you're right, there are 3 names for color spaces: <br />
hsb + hsv [synonyms] and<br />
hsl.<br />
<br />
so it's hsb/hsv in the end. changed that and finished comment [I wanted to thank QuadHelix but forgot to finish the post scriptum :rolleyes:]<br />
<br />
oh and asd, could you do the exe part, I don't have NSIS [and thus Pimpbot] on this comp [don't wanna dl it now, wanna bed ;)] and this comp's floppy drive is b0rked so I would have to burn it in order to get it to my comp... forth and back again! :cry:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Because it's a single preset, not a pack and should not have been published outside the skin as the reviewer said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it might be a skin only download then,  this is crazy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not really, AVS scene just is a bit different i guess. In skinning terms you might compare a one preset publish to a skin that only changes the main-window, equalizer and playlist, nothing else. It's just not worth publishing one preset alone, no matter how good it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks Tug, I get it. Anyway I still think its a great one. I did publish other paks here that had multiple AVS in em  they got better ratings.  And by the Way The Name should be Skin Consortium not my name Ralph Barber error on my part I hope a moderator can change it.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

[B]Then i'll represent the western-part. I'm from a small town located between Cologne and Düsseldorf (NRW)! ;) <br />

Allright, I'll represent the eastern part then, as i'm from Leipzig.<br />

Btw, we could also sing the <br />
national anthem of the former GDR (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auferstanden_aus_Ruinen). ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now that's a coincidence! ;)<br />
But there really seams to be some kind of high concentration of avs enthusiastics in a rather small part of the world! ;)</div></div><hr />
