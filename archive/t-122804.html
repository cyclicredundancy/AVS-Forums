      An attempt to create evolving forms. As it began to take on elements of hand-blown glass making, I focused on that and enjoy the results.</p>

      </blockquote>Several Hours!!!:confused: Sorry, but I don't have that much time.:p Looks nice though. Upon looking at the code in your superscopes it looks like you just made up stuff. I'm not sure about your movement. And I wouldn't say that forms evolve. It's just random numbers. Nice overall effect, but it needs something else.

      <p class="post-content">Hey, anubis, thanks! I did hack at those scopes a lot to get the desired effects. If you're still interested, here's a cutaway view (avs attached) of one "dna strand" (scope) and how it interacts with the sigmoid forming function.<br />
      <br />
      As for evolution, yeah, wishful thinking I guess. What I do like is the way the forms combine into illusions, like watching clouds. And with all the overlapping variables (several of which are accelerated at different rates and modulated by music volume), I'll probably never see the exact same image twice -- after the first few frames anyway. The randomized inits are an attempt to get a different effect on each launch.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, it looks nice, but you are making it sound more complex than it is(DNA Strands???). Try making it beat detective by rerandomizing some of the variables on beat.</p>

      <blockquote>

      But it really doesn't evolve and nobody doesn't have the patience to wait for several hours for a preset to get going. I think (based on my own style of viewing preset) the overall time of people viewing ONE preset is about 5secs to 2minutes.<br />
      <br />
      Evolving avs... now that would be something, but this isn't it. It just increases the value used to multiply R.
