<div class="posttext">Any of you think you could teach me 3-D coding or what ever it's called? I think I might be able to break the noob barrier if I knew it. Also some Superscope know-how?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You have posted 3(three) threads when you could have posted only one thread with one post and all you wanted.Weird.And PLEASE search the forums for all this,or look at Tips&amp;Tricks.But,search forums before you ask any question(except porn i think,ask me for that).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Search through the forums for help with 3D.  The best way to do it is to figure it out yourself though.  Basically, what you do is you come up with equations for x, y, and z, and then use the rotation matrices(use google for mor info) to rotate them, and then &quot;project&quot; the 3D figure onto a 2D plane.  There is plenty of info in the avs forums you just got to look for it.<br />
<br />
For superscope know-how, try looking through the assorted &quot;Tips and tricks&quot; threads that we have.  It really depends on what your looking for, exactly.  The best way, IMO, to make AVS is to decide on what you want to make and then figure out how to make it.  For example, I want to have a preset with 3D collisions, and I am currently trying to figure out how to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3D isn't everything for fuck sake...<br />
(sorry, im having a mild hangover and i just hate 3D artists who think they are soooo fucking cool if they know 3D)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Please forgive mr.tugg. <br />
Accentmatt, meet tuggammi. The best damn avs artiste on this board. <br />
(imho, but the criticts will stir restlessly).<br />
He is right, despite his hangover: if your new to this, dont think that knowing 3d will make you a good artist. n reality, it will probably make you a shit artist, and noone likes a shit artist, do they? <br />
<br />
For further inquiries, please goto this thread..<br />
(is 2d avs still good to make?)<br />

<div class="posttext">AVS Axer , heh :D<br />
<br />
Sorry again for the harsh words, i don't have anything against 3D, im not a purist/fanatic or something (what ever it is called) I do advice to learn everything about avs you can &amp; are willing to learn, that means 3D also. The reason for my comment is that a lot of people ignore rest of what AVS has to offer once they learn 3D. 3D is cool and can produce some amazing presets, but doing only 3D presets just because it goes past the &quot;n00barrier&quot; isn't so wise and will only end up in no good presets.<br />
<br />
Search, Learn, Create 3D but please don't forget everything else once you have mastered 3D.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you can make good presets without any technical knowledge (or less) but its always good to make it technically advanced ( may even help sometimes as it may increse speed e.g the other day i was just fooling around with tugg's metablobs preset from bitmapped II and found that I could replace 20 ssc's with one random generator ssc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th April 2003, 11:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">shreas, now you make me feel low :(<br />
<br />
:blah: :p<br />
<br />
Yeah it helps often, but sometimes it looks like using one hyper advanced ssc is actually worse than using a couple of simple scopes :igor: , rarely though.<br />
<br />
Jheriko comes into mind when we talk about technically advanced ssc's :) Those are pretty slow for just scopes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The other thing is.. <br />
as far as i know, none of the avs makers on this board are motivated by money. Perfection is just something that would happen if anyof us could be fucked. So, presets will be slow, or orkwardly coded because its too much effort to do otherwise..<br />
<br />
remember that we are all in it for fun.</div></div><hr />
