<div class="posttext">[/lurkmode]<br />
I've received questions about if it was okay to start with WFC4.<br />
<br />
I've never 'owned' the forum, or it's compilations.<br />
My thoughts and opinions have always been worth as much as anyone elses, so.. there's no need to ask for permissions or anything, really.<br />
<br />
Have fun with WFC4 guys. Please just to keep in mind what the word 'community' means.<br />
<br />
<br />
For whoever is going to run it, pm me if you would like to have the passwords for:<br />
*winamp.forums[at]gmail[d.t]com<br />
*winamp-forums.deviantart.com<br />
*winamp.com profile<br />
*etc<br />
<br />
If needed, my forum will stay online too.<br />
<br />
<br />
When we first began, I was convinced that we couldn't pull WFC1 off. Obviously, I was wrong.<br />
I can only hope that y'all can prove me wrong about this community now, too.<br />

<div class="posttext">Well guys, I've been thinking long and hard about this compliation. If no one else offers, or objects, I would like to take a shot at running this. I won't be submitting, but I would still like to play a role in the creation.<br />
<br />
Stepping up, I have a few new ideas to incorporate into this compilation which I don't want to reveal just yet, but I have a feeling that you will really enjoy the changes. With this pack, I hope to bring the ever-changing and evolving AVS community together and closer, to create one of the best packs of the year!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm sorry to say, but i'll have to skip this one. You might already have noticed my rather scarce presence in the AVS forums recently (due to pretty much work for uni during this semester). But there is certainly not enough time for AVS'ing atm. I hope that i'll have at least a bit more free time next semester... :hang:<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck and all the best for WFC4!! :D :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st February 2006, 21:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, we'll I've finally had some time to take a look at all of this and I think I've got a good idea of how to run this one.<br />
<br />
I've found that in review of the previous compilations, an average of 15 original presets were submitted by an average of 9 different artists. The size of the packs were of great issue and discussion in the previous compilations, however reduction was never needed. Keeping in style, if the amount of original presets becomes too large a system of reduction can be discussed.<br />
<br />
However with only 5 people so far, this may not be needed. I'm hoping for at least a few more than this! Where's Tugg, JFASI, StevenRoy? I've seen Zamuz, Synth-C and Yath popping in from time to time. There surely must be a few more people who would like to participate! So come on, folks!<br />
<br />
Well first and foremost, I would like to set a deadline for the original presets, which is: March 12. &quot;March 12?!&quot;, I hear you ask. Well, 39 days seemed like a nice number. Not only that, February is the shortest month so I wanted to have it be a bit longer than that. And not only that, my break from school begins the following day. Therefor, I'll have time to organize all the presets and send out the submissions for remixing.<br />
<br />
By March 17, you should all have received your originals for remixing. The deadline and the plans for the remixes will be released and discussed at this time. I had planned for April 13, but if more time is needed it is certainly negotiable, as is anything else in this post. If anyone is unhappy with what I've suggested, please feel free to say so! If more time is needed for anything, or if anyone has any other things they would like to suggest, I'm always open for ideas!<br />
<br />
So as the last compilations, anyone wishing to join should send no more than two (2) presets to winamp.forums[at]gmail[dot]com by March 12. <br />
<br />
Finally, have fun, but remain diligent! March will be here before you know it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">JaVS_v2.5, incorrect. The deadline is March 12. I don't know how all the time zone conversions and shit works, so anything submitted after I wake up on the 13th will not be included. :p<br />
<br />
By the 17th, the remixes should all have been distributed. I'm doing this because I have a lot of shit going on, and may not have time to organize and send them all out the same day that they're due in by.<br />
<br />
As of yet, there is 3 presets by 2 artists. Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks, JaVS. Try to work on one more before the deadline. And please, next time try to make an original preset.<br />
<br />
Update: 5 presets by 4 artists.<br />
<br />
As with everyone else, the whole point is to have original presets, exculsive to this pack. This way when it's released, your newest work will be displayed. I suppose I should have made this more clear in the beginning, but from here on out, please try to create submit something new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Come on, guys! What's with submitting only one preset? Understandingly, some may submit another preset still before the deadline is up. But, when 3 of the artists have already said that this is all that will be submitted, this could turn out to be quite a small pack.<br />
<br />
QOALsoft: I think it may be a little late. If you feel you can create two, or even one, original preset in 9 days then we'll take a look at it. I do remember seeing your thread concerning your first pack in development stages, and was a bit impressed. Otherwise, you may want to wait for the next compilation. I suppose it's up to you from here. :)</div></div><hr />

You are forgetting the strong and proud tradition of pushing back deadlines for winamp forums compilations <br />
:) I suppose... But this is why I set the initial deadline at 40 days, I figured this would leave ample opportunity but I also forget how lazy avs artists are. :p<br />
<br />
To ASD5A: I have no problem with you creating the intro for this pack. I had thought someone else had volunteered but, looking back, perhaps I'm thinking about WFC3. :shrug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">StevenRoy</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th March 2006, 22:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, you could be thinking about that intro I made for WFC3. (I'm still proud of that one.) I've been working on ideas for a new intro (complete with new custom font!), but I think I'd be lucky to get that working right in time for WFC6.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've actually got three WFC4 presets -nearly- ready to send in. Since I still have some time, though, I'm going to continue looking for ways to tweak and improve them a bit. Once the deadline (the 12th, thank goodness!) nears, then I'll choose the two that I think turned out the best.</div></div><hr />

One looks quite good and is 'ready, willing and able', the other looks even better but needs some performance tweaking.<br />
I'll send them in once the 2nd is ready too.<br />
<br />
Do not yet think we're losing the race :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">StevenRoy: Sweet! :D As for the intro, yep. I looked back at the previous compilations and did a D'oh!<br />
<br />
JFASI: Huh? As in today? I'm confused, but excited.<br />
<br />
Grandchild: I'm really looking forward to your presets. I haven't seen too much of your work, but I'm always hearing good reviews about you. :)<br />
<br />
On to other matters: Would anyone be willing to write an installer for the pack? I believe Jheriko had mentioned, in WotL's forums, that he would do it, but if he's no longer able to we could find someone else. If all else fails, Pimpbot should suffice.<br />
<br />
Also, I was thinking of redesigning the images previously used for the packs. Meaning, at deviantART and Winamp.com, when you see the link to click on the pack, and the larger image used to display the preview of sort, and the opening image of the installer. I'm not sure what to call these, but I think you know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had begun working on this before my hard drive was destroyed. What I had was the Winamp logo at the top of the page, centered in a canvas of 275x425, with all the names of the participants around it. I thought it would be cool to personalize it a bit, and used my Wacom tablet to write everyones names. Well, with my hard drive destroyed, the drivers for the tablet were destroyed. And since I'm an idiot and threw the recovery CDs away, I can't use it unless I find a place to retreive the drivers.<br />
<br />
Well, what do you guys think about this? I know that's not what is important, but I think it would be a nice addition or feature. If anyone would like to attempt to redesign this, please feel free to and send your ideas to the same email address. If not, I'll whip something up quick when the final release nears closer. :)</div></div><hr />

it would intro making alot easier if i knew who participates.<br />
however intro is 90,2924% done (need to make a .bmp for every participant and need to think about a neat startup effect and frame rate independancy)</div></div><hr />

Warning! That is not an official time measure! :p<br />

You guys still have plenty of time: 13 hours and 41 minutes, as of this post. To keep it simple for me, the deadline is for when I wake up tomorrow. :D<br />

Anything after that will not be accepted (unless prior arrangements have been made).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Check your email. :)<br />
<br />
The presets have been sent out for remixing. Everyone should have received a zip file containing 2-4 presets.<br />
<br />
There was no set order in deciding who you would be remixing. I had my brother assign everyone a number and write the numbers onto torn pieces of paper. He then rolled the pieces into balls and I pulled them out of a hat.<br />
<br />
When all was over, I realized that some of you may not be too thrilled about who you got to remix, but this is a pack for the whole community. Anyway, I'm sure we can all think of something for the presets. :)<br />
<br />
The deadline is yet to be discussed. Since some of us had trouble with the previous deadline, why not try for April 30? If more time is needed we could extend it. On the other hand, if they're all in before that, you may get a pleasant surprise a few weeks early. :D<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
To Jheriko: Contact me for your zip file. I didn't have an email address to send it to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@dsfs [now i know ;)]: it might be better for WFC5 if you'd make a final check which presets are send to whom [and make modifications]. Cause if you let you're little brother do it, what should e.g. Matt do w/ Pak's or J's preset?<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I looked over the list again, you're just mad because you got stuck remixing Matt. :p<br />
<br />
But seriously, I reviewed and did make a few modifications to the list. I was actually pleased with my brother's choices but I didn't want Jheriko to remix Pak-9 (and neither did Jheriko, consequently), and I didn't want StevenRoy and Yathosho remixing themselves (not quite sure how that happened).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I suppose I could bump the deadline forward a week or so if we don't need the extra time. I myself haven't even started to remix but Pak's right, it doesn't take as long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nah, I'm almost always pretty far from being pissed off.<br />
I just thought some might've gotten sth that was too sophisticated for their AVSing abilities [not sth that's too bad]. but if you did have a look at the list in the first place then everything is just alright! :D<br />
[I have in fact turned matts thing into sth almost watchable and if this'd fail I have two other cool presets to remix anyway]<br />

For me, I've got one that's starting to look pretty good. I'm not too sure what more to do with it, so I'm taking the day off from it and let it sink in.

<br />
I just checked the email, no new remixes. I've been lazy with mine. I have one that's about finished and another that's just getting started (3 days ago, I opened the preset and saved it under a new filename!), but that's it. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If there's a DM that you can't figure out, maybe you could see what happens if you simply delete it. Then you can try to find something else to put there, and hopefully undo some of the damage you caused by deleting that DM. Perhaps that's cheating, but it is possible to get an interesting remix that way.</div></div><hr />

Kar-ma, sorry for the delay. I'll, indeed, change the writing and send out the updated file. I've been lazy and haven't had much time to do it. And not only that, but I forgot how I created them. Stupid me, I deleted the .psd files that contained all the layering.<br />

JFASI, the tentative deadline is April 30. If time needs to be extended a bit, it's not big deal. I'll probably need more time for myself as well. If it becomes too great of an inconvenience, I'll submit the one that I have and discard the rest.</div></div><hr />

Grandchild, I've worked on yours but nothing good has come of it. I hope it's not too much upsetting.<br />
<br />
ASD5A, I'm waiting on a response from Kar-ma. I've updated his texer but I just want to make sure it's okay. BTW, would you like another texer that says WFC4? Or anything else? It's been a while since I saw the intro, you may have changed it quite a bit though.</div></div><hr />

JFASI and Grandchild:<br />
Unfortunately, I just don't have the time to go back and change all of the texers. Kar-ma's was pretty easy, but I would have to rewrite both of your's. The handwriting can take quite a while, I spent around an hour each on Jheriko's and Yathosho's. If I happen to find more time again before the release I may give it another shot. Sorry, guys. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">All very nice however there is one preset that crashes my winamp &gt; WFC4 - 33 - Remix - Yathosho - Electronique (Boxique Mix by PAK-9).avs .   <br />
<br />
Im running winxp pro. Im guessing that it's a bad .ape file  or is it a .ape that always crashes winxp thats being used. any help would be great. The rest of the pack works flawlessly <br />
<br />
Ive included below a very detailed list of the ape's I have in my winamp directory I think I have it well pruned but if you can spot something that does not belong  or is a outdated version or any that are problematic please let me know. <br />

Is everthing else I have for APE's ok anything you might change or remove ?  Personally I would remove 50 or so percent of those APE's simply because they are rubbish and presets that use them tend to be a bit rubbish too; there is no harm in leaving them there though so I suggest you just leave them unless you know what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Generally people will include the lastest versions of whatever APE's are required in the pack installer, there was just a bit of a slip up this time.</div></div><hr />

I didn't include it into the installer, because I had assumed you used all of the updated files. I hadn't noticed this at all before GC just pointed it out.</div></div><hr />
