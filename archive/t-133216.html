      i think it would be helpful to have a standard avs-benchmark, that runs a couple of presets for a defined time and then calculates the average fps.<br />
      <br />
      not sure if its possible within an ape, but not a bad thought i think :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">umm...since when do we care about actual fps rates over whether the preset is bearable to watch or not?</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually that feature would even be better as an inbuilt. it would detect to optimum resolution for the user's computer-setup. could prevent (a part of) noobie from whining that avs runs slow in 1240x1024 :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">...they'd still whine cos avs is slow, and they'd still blame it on the artist and not the original programmer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like the idea. Though who am I to speak? I plainly love benchmarks anyway. I have most (if not, all) of the large ones, and a shitload of the smaller benchmarks. It would be great if I could add this one to my collection, not to speak it would be very useful to keep n00bies off with speed questions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">good idea, but the average fps too would be very unsure, cause we have presets who give 50 fps as well as 2 fps</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think it would be enough to determine the perfect resolution to run the presets in 25fps (same as PAL). the benchmark presets should be have enough effects but then again be optimized for that refresh rate.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok, well sounds good, I am making an avs preset to determine optimum resolution and speed for your comp.</p>
