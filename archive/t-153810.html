<div class="posttext">Hello again friends,<br />
Its me, Dragon ( under a new spiffy name. ) <br />
:D <br />
Once again ive been through a hell load of misery in my failing real world life ( if you can call it that. ) and I kind of lost touch with my online personalities. AVS included. <br />
Ive broken up with my girlfriend, started recording of a CD with one of my bands, engaged in several acts of stress and sorrow inspired brutal self harm ( bloody. ) and had more mental breakdown and physical sickness ( messed up bad. )<br />
I had my latest pack ( which is real nice by the way. ) Stored on my PC for a while, but never officially released it ( Its been updated since you all last saw it :up: ).<br />
Could someone please provide an NSIS template or something cause im afriad I dont have the time to learn how to code for the program, that and I suck and would fail anyway.<br />
Hopefully I can get this pack released sometime this century huh? ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I didnt even know this guy, I was walking home and he was plastered. He asked me for a smoke and to shut him up I gave him one, unfortunately it only got him talking. He was saying stuff like, if anyone gives you trouble give me a call... I was like &quot;riiight&quot;... then he said he had this gun in his bag, and it  freaked me. You dont come across this stuff much where I live, over here if you have a gun, you intend to use it. This guy was a hazard, and I didnt want to be near him when things went off. Fortunately he veered off and probably collapsed somewhere. I just walked quickly in the other direction.<br />
Lucky, this guy was scary.<br />
<br />
And yes, the pack will hopefully be out quite soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For some reason I couldnt seem to get Pimpbot to work... craziness. It just gets all the way to the end and then says 'Creation Failed'. No reason or anything. Damn.</div></div><hr />
