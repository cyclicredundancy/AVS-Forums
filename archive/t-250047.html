      <p class="post-content"><strong>Encode AVS</strong><br />
      Is there any hardware or software that can encode or make AVS from monitor to the wall?<br />
      <br />
      For example: I have party &amp; I like see AVS from my PC to the walls of the rooms.<br />
      <br />
      Like as projectors in cinema that reflected light from projector to the cinema's screen.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any hardware in AVS's world that can make or encode this technology?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Projectors can project everything from your computer screen to the wall, right? And everything also includes AVS, right? There's your answer.<br />
      <br />
      But buying a projector is not a small investment, so i suggest you read up on it first. I don't know much about them myself as i don't have one and haven't read too much about them. Well besides that from magazines, but they are usually just tests and reviews which only put them in the "what's the best" order.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I didn't know PC has socket that can connect to the projectors.<br />
      <br />
      you mean at the back of pc we have socket that can connect to the projectors. you mean with a cable that connect pc &amp; projectors we can see AVS in our walls &amp; rooms. WOW it's cute.<br />
      <br />
      I will test it in the future.<br />
      <br />
      But always I thought there is a hardware can make a connection with pc &amp; wall. that hardware is projectors?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I did not know projectors can do this subject. It's wonderful!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">For as far as your computer is concerned, a monitor is equal to a projector. I work with projectors professionally on a daily basis.<br />
      <br />
      You also speak about hardware to connect to the wall, do you mean a projection screen? If so, I suggest you only go for 'Projecta' screens. All other brands suck llama balls (in my opinion).<br />
      <br />
      About the projector.. you can either use a <i>video card with dual-monitor out</i>, or use a <i>VGA splitter</i> to send the visual information to both your monitor and the projector.<br />
      I suggest you don't get a DLP projector, but one with LCD-technology; AVS has fast moving images, and DLP technology really sucks at that.<br />
      <br />
      I suggest you contact a local dealer for specific details about hardware<br />
