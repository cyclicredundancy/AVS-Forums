      <p class="post-content">i guess ill use milkdrop instead! :P since alot of people seem to be having the same problem. i wonder if it has anything to do with the warning that be careful overlay color has to be carefully selected at non 32 bpp or something?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The default overlay color should be okay.<br />
      The 32bpp warning is for people who are running their monitor on 24 or 16bpp if I'm right.<br />

      Noone really knows which videocard works and which one doesn't, but trying different drivers could help, though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your problem is probably Vista. AVS depends on DirectDraw functionality which MS haven't supported for a while.<br />
      <br />
      I have tons of problems with Vista and AVS...<br />
      <br />
      Everything going green shows that the overlay set up is correct, but the render is failing and you are getting the default green screen from something... I don't know enough to be accurate, but its not an issue with overlay mode from what you describe.</p>
