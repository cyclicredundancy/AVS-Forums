      <p class="post-content"><strong>avs &amp; 3D Glasses??</strong><br />
      3d glasses (I have the elsa revelators) supposedly work with any open gl or d3d game that uses the z buffer. doesn't avs use d3d?<br />
      <br />
      my problem is that 3d viewing doesn't work with avs as i had hoped it would...it's still cool for games though..any thoughts?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Avs does not use the graphicscard or 3d acceleration in any way.<br />
      It only uses the processor speed.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS preset for 3D glasses</strong><br />
      I saw a guy on devart who had created an AVS preset especially for use with 3D-glasses here's the link: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=50471" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=50471</a><br />
      <br />
      I haven't been able to check if it really worked, cause I don't have such glasses.</p>

      <p class="post-content">They are the elsa revelators (wireless version). I paid roughly $60 + shipping. Check out elsa.com for info about them.<br />
      <br />
      Look on shopper.com or pricewatch.com for "revelator" to buy. They are usually out of stock for a while and it took about a month of backorder for me to finally get mine. Good luck. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D perspective required</strong><br />
      First of all, ParaNoya, your presets rock and there should be some kind of art gallery where people can see presets of yours and others and actually commission you guys for visualization art. As for the 3D glasses thing, I would think that any presets that would work with the glasses would have to be based on a 3D engine which AVS is not. Then you'd have images with depth like the ending of Kubrick's 2001 or the Dr. Who TV series. Maybe some AVS presets involve 3D tunnel or corridor type effects, but not vividly. Maybe using the old anaglyph glasses would be interesting for now.</p>
