			<strong>Can you identify this mystery preset?</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I used this preset back in 2002 and I can't remember the name of it.  I think it's an avs preset.  I customized the vis window so there's no border.<br />
<br />
I think it was called &quot;fire dance with me&quot;, but I can't find that anywhere.  I might've tweaked the colors.<br />
<br />
It was very responsive to the music.

		Yes, it is AVS, but I couldn't give you the name or artist's name. It is a very 'basic' preset, which makes it really difficult to identify. It isn't mine, that's all I can say for sure.<br />
<br />
How did you get this screenshot? is it still from 2002 or can you provide one in the original resolution?<br />
<br />
I tried to re-create it, is this (download attachment below) what it looked like, or were there differences? colors, anything else?

		Thanks for attempting to remake it.  That's not it though.  It looked like the screenshot; two opposing hemispheres that met in the middle.  Kind of like an apple core.  The top hemisphere wasn't always present.  I think it was only visible with high decibels.<br />
<br />
The lower half of the image is the full resolution.  It's from a screen capture I took back in 2002.

		Well you could get <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=318850" target="_blank">the archive</a> and try your luck there. If it's not in the archive, noone has it. But it's a bit of a hassle since they're all (read: hundreds of) seperate installers.<br />
I suggest you try the <a href="http://visbot.net/cat/VB200.zip" target="_blank">visbot 200</a> first and try your luck there.<br />
<br />
Since most of the people who visited this place in 2002 are gone, I seriously doubt somebody else recognises it, but perhaps you're lucky. Anyone?

		why are people always looking for noob presets? :(<br />
<br />
if you're into that style of visuals, why not use milkdrop in the first place?
