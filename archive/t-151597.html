<div class="posttext">I wish in next AVS we see button for saving picure of that AVS.<br />
<br />
I mean when I want to make AVS &amp; save picture of it for publishing in winamp, we must go to another software for example photoshop, paint,... <br />
<br />
It is wonderful when AVS had this magic button &amp; we did not need for any software.<br />
<br />
I hope you got my idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think that's not too hard to make. Just an APE with one button, which takes a screenshot to a given location, in the preffered format. Something like AVSGrabber, but then for pics, not for entire movies. I'd like it :) Could come in handy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't see the problem with pressing Print Screen and then opening up paint and pasting it in there, but whatever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">People who think you need special 'capture' software for screenshots obviously haven't learn about Printscreen :P.<br />
<br />
That's been around since Win3.1 if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think he knows about printscreen - I just don't think he wants to go through the trouble of pasting and saving it in Paint.  It's not that much of a hassle though, which is why I don't consider an APE to be needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Or, if anyone would use my program with its possibillities *sigh*<br />
<br />
Its soooo easy. Take a screenshot, have a look at it, refresh until you really like the screenshot and then save to file.<br />
<br />
No copy-pasting. No cutting off the edges.<br />
<br />
Maybe i should start a &quot;What can i do with Hotlist and how do i use it&quot; thread. :hang:</div></div><hr />
