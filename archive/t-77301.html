      hi all,<br />
      <br />
      i am a newbie, and i need some help here. i want to feed the detected beat from avs to an external program as a trigger signal. how should i do that ? does somebody know this ? or does somebody know how to get winamp's variable spectrumData without having to write a vis plug-in ? by the way, i'm using delphi.<br />
      <br />
      thanks before.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You have to write a visualisation plug-in to grab spectrumData. No way around that. You'll need to write your own beat-detection code in that case.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to use AVS's beat detection, you could write an APE, but you'd need to modify all your presets to include it.<br />
      <br />
      I believe there is a Delphi Vis plugin SDK, but APE's only have a C++ SDK.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey Seren4chen!<br />
      <br />
      I'm also one of the Delphi Users (we're rare but we're ther) :D<br />
      As i experienced it, it's realy hard to write some good vis plugs starting up without any knowledge. Maybe you should try to use your Soundcard's MixRecord function. Record the sound and get the signal into your prog directly. But maybe that's even more difficult, i never tried such things out...<br />
      By the Way, doyou have any Drag&amp;Drop experiences? I've almost completed a hotkey tool <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=76893" target="_blank">(click here for info)</a> but i'm still struggling with adding drag&amp;drop. :confused:<br />
      <br />
      Hope you'll succeed</p>
