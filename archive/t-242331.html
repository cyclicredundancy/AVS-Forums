      Yes, I know its noob work and that no code is used, i have a book on c code so the next presets will be better. it does, or so i think prove that some fairly good presets can be made without code<br />
      <br />
      feel free to improove them, but don't take them and use them as your own...<br />
      <br />
      hey!? how do i post it, the file?<br />
      <br />
      well i have some pics though:<br />

      I think winamp 5 has ignored my plug ins, my first one didnt install properly, i didnt think about making an EXE file. i got to mails from "mike the llama" saying that the blug in had been blocked, although i only sent it once, i sent an self extracting exe file after that, and its never come up one the plug in section....<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's like this:<br />
      <br />
      I don't exactly remember it, but I probably had to reject the preset (on account of it not being a valid .exe). Don't know why you got the email twice.<br />
      <br />
      The submitted stuff doesn't show up immediately. It sits there until someone reviews it. Right now there are some issues with the database, and I can't get to it. Have some patience, ok ?<br />
      <br />
      The account under which you submit stuff on winamp.com is not connected to your forums account. You can use your email adress there, but you can't use it here. You use your nick. Not sure if I understood you completely (use commas, ffs).<br />
      <br />
      Some more details about the "email adresses" being invalid would be nice too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The third thing you said: My forumthing is allright, but ive forgot my password and its set to send the mail to my old account (i have lots but here are the ones on your database:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="mailto:Metallord_13@hotmail.com">Metallord_13@hotmail.com</a> (my forum email, and my winamp.com "username"<br />
      <a href="mailto:Bsandar@hotmail.com">Bsandar@hotmail.com</a> (my old forum account "sandar"<br />
      <br />
      Acctually i was hoping you could delete all info about the account i sent the plugin thing with, this way i can make a new and in case unblocked account. i can send an email from <a href="mailto:Metallord_13@hotmail.com">Metallord_13@hotmail.com</a> to confirm that it is me you are deleting on request.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Offtopic, but sandar, you send me a private message and i can't reply to it because when i try to it gives me the following:<br /></p>
