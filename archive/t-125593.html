<div class="posttext">I know I saw a solution to this problem before, but I searched through every relevant topic on this troubleshooting board and could not find it.<br />
<br />
This is actually two problems.  The first and most troubling is the fact that when I try to run AVS in Winamp 2 (as suggested by many of you), a white spectrum analyzer appears over most (but not all, strangely) presets.  I have tried everything I can think of to make this go away, but it won't.  I'm sure there's a simple solution (probably too simple, that's why I can't find it :p ).  The second problem is that some presets I created using WA3 won't work at all in WA2.  For example, one preset has an effect list full of stuff in WA3, but when I open it in the AVS editor in WA2, the only thing in the effect list is a Render - Simple (oddly, the spectrum analyzer thing doesn't show up with this one... hmmm).<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated, since I know AVS uses the processor, and that WA2 uses less processor resources, and I have a very slow machine and well, it needs all the help it can get. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The spectrum problem has come up before.  No one could figure it out.  Do you have the most recent AVS version(2.5 I believe)?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you may not have the most recent version for Winamp2.  Try reinstalling winamp 2 and see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What version of WA2 do you have.<br />
<br />
I had problems with eveything above 2.7c. With 2.8 and up AVS simply will not work for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">According to the info thingy, I have version 2.76 (x86) and AVS version 2.5.<br />
<br />
Maybe that thread I saw this problem in went unanswered... o_O</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It did go unanswered. Here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=120563) .  Try getting an older version of Winamp.  This may help.</div></div><hr />
