<div class="posttext">Im curious, what's going on here? Why is the 5 last avs submissions all rated 3 stars and reviewed with only one word? What the heck is up with that?<br />
<br />
Color it (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=146645) - Staff Review: Interesting.<br />
<br />
BEST MIX 1  (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=146660) - Staff Review: Ok, We'll take your word for it.<br />
(so this one has more than one word :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
denkensiefursich reincarnation (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=146711) - Staff Review: Good job.<br />
(Good job? That's it? I think this deserves a decent review and 4 stars atleast :mad: )<br />
<br />
zaks shapes vol2 (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=146719) - Staff Review: The more eye candy the better.<br />
<br />
Square-Minded Remix (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=146749) - Staff Review: Windoze<br />
(Windoze? The heck is that suppose to mean?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just what is going on around here? Did the site got hacked, did the reviewers got fired? Or is winamp turning against it's own product now?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">^you're grandchild I suppose?<br />
but this is psychotic indeed...<br />
<br />
Let's review these reviews:<br />
These reviews are obviously your first attempts at reviewing.<br />
I suggest you read some tutorials about this and come back later.<br />
Also, don't post your opinion in words, but collect them into so-called 'sentences'.<br />
Do not forget the actual 'Rating' itself too. Simply selecting three stars for everything won't do, especially for reincarnation.<br />
<br />
Try writing some testreviews in notepad for yourself, just to give yourself some practice.<br />
<br />
But until then, don't bother even touching the winamp plugin submitting area.<br />
<br />
Final score: :( :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad:</div></div><hr />

Oh, well...<br />
<br />
I don't care so much about the rating, rather the review. I'm glad that they finally got around to publishing my pack, but &quot;Good job.&quot;? A review is supposed to be a critical evaluation, be it good or bad.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to improve as an artist, and the creators of my so called weapon-of-choice have certainly let me down with their absence of criticism. If this is what I have to look forward to, I'll just stick with posting links to deviantart in the future. :hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok.... I was away for a couple of weeks (extremely busy with my college + trip to Slovenia), and I apologize for the wait.<br />
<br />
However, I WASN'T the one who did that. I mean, damn, you (probably) know me. I am ALWAYS eloquent in my ratings, and they're more or less fair.  A couple of days ago I visited the site to see if they're still there, and they were (only had 15 minutes to myself). Today, I finally managed to scrounge up the time to review stuff. And there weren't ANY packs in the queue. I went to the plugins section, read the reviews, and suddenly had an urge to rip someone's head off.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry dsfs, I really am...   I'll edit all of those with proper numbers and reviews, but due to the crapiness of the site, the 3 will stick while browsing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm.... update. Something like that has also happened to the skins.... maybe the site did get hacked... but it's too damn odd.<br />

<br />
Edit: Tug, what's your opinion on Color it and Square Minded Remix ?     They're both &quot;remix minipacks&quot; of your presets. Is the difference big enough to let them stay, or ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't know i haven't watched it, i usually just ignore remixes done by people whom i don't know, because i know i would just end up hating it and then flame someone :hang:<br />
<br />
[edit]Well i watched them and i atleast have to give it a thumbsup:up: for editing my code, but the effects he added aren't that great, so i don't really like it, but i guess it's worth 1,5 or even 2 stars.</div></div><hr />

Remixes without permission should not be allowed on the site.  They are RIPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, wally, I know, but the AVSers tend to be a bit more liberal, if the author's credited that is, and I always ask before I kill (in this case, I'm still not sure), so... <br />
<br />
Tug, do you want me to kill them ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th December 2005, 14:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i don't specificly state in my comments that you must ask me personally (the trusting fool that i am) and he did give me credit for the preset.<br />
<br />
So technically it's not a rip and i don't think winamp will apply a policy that would &quot;not allow really bad remixes, because they don't add much to the original&quot;, or does it?<br />
<br />
In short: I really don't like the preset, but he did give me credit. Now the question is do you think it shouldn't be in the site simply because it sucks?<br />
<br />
[edit]Im not the one to dictate the rules and policies of winamp, so i say let it stay, because it doesn't break the rules of the site.<br />
<br />
But on the day when a policy that simply doesn't allow bad submissions will step in order, note me and i'll start gathering a list of all the shitty 1 preset n00b submissions :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If we killed sucky presets, packs, and especially skins, there'd only be a few thousand skins/plugins left on the website. So no, it stays then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK, I'll re-phrase:<br />
<br />
Any remix without credit to AND permission from the original author is a RIP and should not be published.<br />
<br />
Any remix with credit to BUT without permission from the original author is a RIP, publication is left up to the original author.<br />

Any remix without credit to BUT with permission from the original author is NOT A RIP and can be published.<br />

<div class="posttext">We've been told by admin that there may have been a good reason for emptying the review queue in one go like this, hence some of the short sharp reviews.<br />
<br />
It would appear that non of your packs/skins were reviewed by your regular gang of reviewers either.<br />

Normal and even better service will be resumed next week hopefully :)</div></div><hr />

Sounds a bit of a conspiracy to me, you know mojomaster/axe paid AOL/nullsoft to publish the plugin fast and feature it... and us little folk get walked over while the big boys play :igor:<br />

I have to report that sometime around yesterday, some of the 3 star rated avs submissions disappeared into oblivion, but now when i look at the most recently submited avs's they are all in place!<br />
<br />
Is it just me and my browser's cache playing tricks on me, or what the heck is going on around here?!<br />

Good things are coming, including a new way to publish AVS presets, you'll have to take my word for that.<br />
<br />
Why don't you guys make a thread here telling him what you would like to see for AVS presets.  The only thing I know so far is he wants to split them from the other plugins.<br />
<br />
We would have skins, plugins and presets.</div></div><hr />
