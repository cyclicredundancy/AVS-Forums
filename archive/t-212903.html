			<strong>Visualizations text disappearing</strong><br />
		
		

		was wondering if anyone else has had this prob or knows how to fix it. I setup text in the avs editor and it work for awhile but then it just goes away until I reboot winamp. if I make the window smaller I can see some of the text but not all of it. This has happened on to seperate pcs so I know its not that, was thinking it was something with winamp 5.08 any Ideas.<br />

		Could you be a bit more specific:<br />
<br />
- Exactly when does it disappear? <br />
- Is the text in the editor still there?<br />
- Did you save the preset (should autosave to temp on AVSclose, but to be certain..)<br />
- Other oddities?

		^..^, if he sais it disappears random after 10..15 minutes, that means it isn't the fontcolor.. :igor:<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know then.. tried re-installing winamp again? I know you've just installed it, but to be certain..

<br />
btw i meant the font type and not the.. ah forget it, it'd still be the same...<br />
<br />

		I get this too, mainly when I'm making complex presets with interfaces and lots of text. It usually occurs when resizing the AVS window a lot. If you close winamp and restart it the text will come back. Its just a bug in the text rendering, I cant put my finger on exactly what causes it.

		i doubt it's going to be fixed, cause most probably avs won't be updated anymore. So, unless there isn't a way to fix this prob through a new render text ape or something we'll have to live with that problem...
