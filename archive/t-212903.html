<div class="posttext">was wondering if anyone else has had this prob or knows how to fix it. I setup text in the avs editor and it work for awhile but then it just goes away until I reboot winamp. if I make the window smaller I can see some of the text but not all of it. This has happened on to seperate pcs so I know its not that, was thinking it was something with winamp 5.08 any Ideas.<br />

<div class="posttext">Could you be a bit more specific:<br />
<br />
- Exactly when does it disappear? <br />
- Is the text in the editor still there?<br />
- Did you save the preset (should autosave to temp on AVSclose, but to be certain..)<br />
- Other oddities?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">^..^, if he sais it disappears random after 10..15 minutes, that means it isn't the fontcolor.. :igor:<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know then.. tried re-installing winamp again? I know you've just installed it, but to be certain..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th April 2005, 21:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, right you are...<br />
<br />
sorry, must have been a bit inattentive... :igor:<br />
<br />
btw i meant the font type and not the.. ah forget it, it'd still be the same...<br />
<br />
/edit: @ tbo perhaps you could upload one of these presets, just to be really sure?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I get this too, mainly when I'm making complex presets with interfaces and lots of text. It usually occurs when resizing the AVS window a lot. If you close winamp and restart it the text will come back. Its just a bug in the text rendering, I cant put my finger on exactly what causes it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yup thats what happen to me if you restart winamp it comes back its very weird. At first I thought it was a resolution prob but I dis proved that. so I'm lost but I sure hope it gets fixed soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i doubt it's going to be fixed, cause most probably avs won't be updated anymore. So, unless there isn't a way to fix this prob through a new render text ape or something we'll have to live with that problem...</div></div><hr />
