<div class="posttext">Soccer Balls in avs. I love it!  It's just an idea, but I'm sure implementing it would be a huge task.  If someone could explain some of the math for it(phi, etc.) I wouldn't mind trying it.  The only problem I see is that it might look like just a bunch of lines, which could be solved by changing the color to black for the back faces and using a Max Blend.<br />
<br />
FYI, A Truncated Icosahedron is a polyhedron with 32 faces (20 hexagons and 12 pentagons), 60 vertices, and 90 edges.  It is also the shape of soccerballs and buckyballs(c-60 compounds).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jheriko made an Icosidodecahedron (Or Triacontadihedron) before, and yes, he used phi a lot. If you want to take a personal look at it, go download his 7th pack (Not meant to be an advertisement, but hey, you'll get to see cool presets in the way). I believe he can help you the most in this topic...<br />
<br />
For phi, use (1+sqrt(5))*0.5. I don't know much of other mathematical concepts, so I guess that's all I can do....As for coordinates... Well, do some googling =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nic01,<br />
Yeah, I've seen Jheriko's Icosidodecahedron, but the Truncated Icosahedron is different.  I know what the numerical value is for phi, but I'm having trouble understanding how to apply it to find the coordinates for polyhedrons.  I've tried running internet searches but the sites don't use phi to find the coordinates like Jheriko has in his polygons.  I'm going to try to find a different way to do it, but if someone can help me with phi then that would be most appreciated.  Wow, that last sentence sounded way too nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Anubis:<br />
The golden ratio was first used in old Greek arhitecture, the relation is whole/biger part = biger part/smaller part or mathematicly writen 1/x=x/(1-x) when you solve this you will get roots x1=(1+sqrt(5))/2 and x2=(1-sqrt(5))/2 the number (1+sqrt(5))/2 is caled Phi and abs((1-sqrt(5))/2) phi. You can also get Phi by deviding infinite fibonaccy number whith a previous fibonaccy number <br />
F(n)/F(n-1).<br />
For he icohasedron coordinates make a google search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">phi is called the golden ratio because it's the ratio most pleasing to the human eye.  it shows up everywhere in the human form; the size of the joints of each finger, the relationship between the width of the nose and the mouth, the width of the teeth (going back in the mouth), etc.  it can be described thus: given a rectangle with sides phi and 1, the difference between the rectangle and a unit square is a scale replica of the rectangle.  therefore we get this equation:<br />
1/(phi-1)=phi/1<br />
now solve for phi:<br />
1/(phi-1)=phi<br />
phi-1=1/phi<br />
phi^2-1=phi<br />
phi^2-phi-1=0<br />
using the quadratic fomula:<br />
phi=(1+-sqrt(1-4*(1*-1)))/2*1<br />
phi=(1+-sqrt(1+4))/2<br />
phi=(1+-sqrt(5))/2<br />
to make phi positive, phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2.<br />
<br />
i don't know how phi is used to find the coordinates of regular shapes (of all dimensions, apparantly).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A further note on phi. In a pentagon it is the ratio of a diagonal to a side. It is also the ratio of one of the diagonal 'arms' to the side of the inner 5gon. <br />
This was not lost on the ancients who came to revere the pentaGRAM so formed for it's perfection.<br />

<div class="posttext">Thanx for your help everyone, but I think I understand phi now.  Still if anyone knows how to go about creating a truncated icosahedron I am still having trouble figuring it out.  The most I have figured out is that regular polyhedrons  have coordinates in the set {±phi,±phi^2,±phi^3,and for the 120-Polyhedron (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=119794) ±2phi^2}.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I finally made the truncated icosahedron!  It was actually a tad more difficult to make than the 120-polyhedron because of its nasty coordinates (the 120 used phi, phi^2, and phi^3 but the soccer ball uses 1/3+2*phi/3 and 2/3 + phi/3, and others).  I am going to work on black and white shading to make it look like a real soccer ball.  Any other suggestions are welcome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This comes a bit late but you could of done this much easyer. You just needed to make a regular icosahedron and turn the triangles into hexagons whith hexagon side length being half of the triangle side lenght. If you will make a solid version for the coloring you might want to do it this way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For once I agree 100% with you Atero - It might have been easier to find the coordinates originally, but now that I have them it would be pointless to find different ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What I ment is since Jheriko already made a solid icosahedron you could just use his scopes and replace his triangles whith<br />
init: pi=acos(-1);hnb=1.5;n=500;<br />
point: r=(i+1)*pi;a=abs(tan(asin(sin(r*hnb))/hnb));<br />
d=sqrt(1+sqr(min(10/a,a)))*0.3;u=1-u;<br />
x=sin(r)*d*(u*2-1);y=cos(r)*d;<br />
<br />
and than chainge the hnb variable from 1.5 to 3.<br />
<br />
If you want to use sceleton object in the final version I know this wont be usefull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">why do i always miss threads which are blatantly aimed at me.<br />
<br />
lets say that you can get the co-ords for a truncated icosahedron from a regular icosahedron. the reason that i use phi is because it makes it easier to code the superscopes, there is no more to it than that. phi occurs a lot in maths, especially geometry. the occurance of phi in the dodecahedron makes a lot of sense because of the pentagons, it also occurs in the icosahedron simply because it is the dual to the dodecahedron. It occurs in numerous semi-regular polyhedra because these shapes can often be derived from icosahedra and dodecahedra, sometimes in combination with other polyhedra.<br />
<br />
For instance, if you wanted to find the vertex co-ordinates of a truncated icosahedron then you would start with the icosahedron and then figure out how 'far down' each vertex you must truncate in order to get triangles and pentagons of equal side length, once you know this then it boils down to doing 'vector type' math to find the x,y and z components of the line from the orignal vertex to the each of the five new ones in order to get the new co-ordinates from the old ones. What you will need to determine to do this is the internal angle of the icosahedron, which i can't remember of the top of my head but has something to do with phi too.<br />
<br />
If you are still stuck then I can demonstrate how to do this for one vertex and then you can do the rest.<br />
<br />
You can take the vertex co-ords from my icosahedron preset in my 'Purely Platonic' minipack.</div></div><hr />
