<div class="posttext">This preset is awesome!  But I'm not sure if it's ready yet.  What do you think I should do with it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The first movment is kinda nasty - creates those large areas of solid color as well as some graininess.  I would create a different movement(make it a DM to add some more reactivity).  It needs some more reactivity as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's pretty good, though i wouldn't call it awesome :)<br />
Yeah the grain doesn't look so good, but i wouldn't suggest to use a dynamove since it would slow down too much and you have to use a pretty high grid size to get even the half quality of the movement.<br />
<br />
The preset is great, the beat detection works well tho sometimes it spins way too fast. This preset really reminds me of my &quot;older days&quot;...<br />
good stuff :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its ok.Like the colors but it isnt exactly my kind of AVS.The grain is pretty ugly yeah.Keep the colors change the first movement a bit and make it rotate less.A dynamic shift would go with that...:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">mmm, looks pretty sweet but i really hate that yellow at points, it looks really nice most of the time, just awful when its just white and yellow, sort that out and sort out the graininess of it at points too like people have been saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah when I first got the movement down, it didn't look too bad, but now I see what you mean.  I'll try and get rid of that overexcessive white/yellow stuff, and I'll slow it down a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Pixelcraft</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th March 2003, 03:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok I got the brightness toned down a bit, and grainy crap is gone (I think) but I'm not really sure how to slow it down.  Can someone tell me how?   <br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Much nicer.  To slow it down change the DM.  Change the line that says &quot;r=r+sigmoid((5-z),pw)*rt-ra;&quot; to &quot;r=r+sigmoid((5-z),pw)*rt/5-ra;&quot;.  You can change the 5 to something else, but I liked it with a 5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">With Anubis's suggestion it works perfectly. Nice uptades on the colors also btw.</div></div><hr />
