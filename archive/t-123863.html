		Well i would gladly attach the file into this post, but the forum has those damn file size limitations and the preset+bitmap+ape are over 200kb in a zip :(<br />
<br />
So instead you should download it from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1270495" target="_blank">DeviantART</a><br />
<br />
Those who don't know, the next pack i will be making is Bitmapped II.<br />
<br />
I'll attach a screenshot if you want to look it before downloading (or not downloading) from deviantart, since deviantart can be a murder for those with slow connections...

		Atero, i do use Picture II, but for some strange reason i can't load any jpegs... i just thought that because it's a &quot;development&quot; version that it didn't had jpeg support yet...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comments guys, i just wish i could do the swirling thing... then it would be perfect :)

i'd download the preset but i'm pressed for time right now, i'll get it when i get back home (promise ;) )<br />
<br />
deviant art is always having technical problems...i think it's high time someone, ah, smarter took over the operation :hang:

		On a good day, yes.  On a bad day(even with my cable modem) it can take 30seconds.  The way DA sets up their site is terrible for speed.  Just take a look at the source for one of the pages. Scary.

		That's a clever preset, which really looks like the science screensaver. I especially like the fact that the AVS window is functioning, since it gives the effect that the view is of a real computer desktop, and not some static image file.
