      <p class="post-content"><strong>Question about writing ape's</strong><br />
      Hello, I'm a VJ using AVS and am interested in writing some ape's for it. I have programming experience in several Languages including VB, C, and C++, althrough i have some very limited experience in C and C++. ok, now the problem is i have no idea how to go about writing an ape for AVS, i downloaded the tutorial and such, but have been having a hard time getting anywhere else with it, also, i'd like to know what the fastest language would be to write in (C++ i would assume?) so i don't waste any processor time with slow code. any and all help would be appreciated, as would some suggestions for ape's that people may want, although i can't promise anything. Thanks.</p>
