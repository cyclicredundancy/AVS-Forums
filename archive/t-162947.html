<div class="posttext">Hi, this is my second post of my avs and they've considerably improved.  I hope you like my work, please reply.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is great! Your presets don't have a lot of complicated math but they look amazing! You've got the sence of style and it's most important thing in AVS! :cool:<br />
Do you have www.deviantart.com account? You should get one, it is a very nice place for AVSers.<br />
I like &quot;Byzantine sandstorm&quot; and &quot;my vision for a wonderful and inevitable future.&quot; the best. But all the presets are very very good! Make a pack, I'll give it 5/5 stars!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well I hope your comments are somewhat in line with what the rest of the world thinks. It had better be pack worthy because i just made one with pimpbot (many thanks to the people at www.whyeye.org for that one!) and submitted it. I'll post again when i get the email saying it's been reviewed and hopefully accepted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">darkday450</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd January 2004, 05:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh yeah, forgot to mention that I got a www.deviantart.com account and I posted the pack there, so if you need it fast I'd suggest you check for it at http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/4504789/<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey, you got some neat stuff there!  yes, I'd definitely call this packworthy.  Like fragmer said, not very tech-heavy, but it still works out to produce some nice colorful visuals. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very Nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">These presets are nice in terms of color, so good work there. I noticed a couple improvements here and there since your last post ;).<br />
<br />
There are two things that you need to work on though. Firstly, the presets as a pack do all look sort of alike. You use the tiling-and-blending part a lot, and it makes the presets less interesting. There is nothing wrong with variations or remixes per se, but try to give every 'flavor' an edge so that they all offer something unique.<br />
<br />
Secondly the behaviour aspect: several presets respond and act exactly the same. You seem to use the same code tricks a lot, and this reflects in how your preset responds. Try experimenting more with smooth morphing, exotic shapes, geometry, etc.<br />
<br />
You've got my attention though ;).<br />
<br />
Finally some technial notes:<br />
<br />
- An effect list set to replace/replace without onbeat or custom coding is useless and just takes up speed. You can move all effects outside for a speed increase and no visual change. (they can be handy during preset development, but should be removed in final presets)<br />
<br />
- Check your code for errors... in greenie crock, one of your DM's has d=d*(sin(t); r=r+d*100 which does nothing due to the missing bracket. The preset behaves as if that DM wasn't there at all<br />
<br />
- Avoid useless components: if you're unsure what something does, play with it in a simple preset. In pool of sines there is a useless buffer save: buffers are simply extra places to store the current image temporarily, but of course they are only useful if you also read back from a buffer at some point. <br />
<br />
- Try optimizing your code. For small bits of code it won't make a noticable difference, but for DMs with high gridsize or SSC with high  'n' it can help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And don't forget to put your presets in one folder ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thx for the feedback everyone, especially UnConeD.  I fixed that dm in greenie crock by deleting it (if you add the bracket the preset looks like crap) and took out a lot of those useless effect lists that I had included merely for organization while making the presets. I also got rid of some of the useless init settings like pi=acos(-1) in dms that didn't even use pi, but there are too many to clean them all up. I put those changes in my pack (as it hadn't yet been reviewed) so hopefully the pack itself will be an improvement over my zip file and sorry about the folder piR.<br />
<br />
It's funny that you all commented my presets are simple because the name of my next pack in the works is &quot;simplicity.&quot;</div></div><hr />
