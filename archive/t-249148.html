      Ok ok it may be small but its all i've got. If you joined the Vissualnoobs team mainly i'm calling out shreyas_potnis,Metaflash,Florin,ASD5A, and JaVS_v2.5 I would like to receive your latest presets so i can add them to the official pack that will be released on the winamp site. if you do not feel it is time for your presets to be shown thats ok. you are not required to. i just don't want this pack to go with only 5 presets in it.<br />
      <br />
      also due to size of the file i've split it. download both and them unzip the file part1.zip in the same folder with the file Visualnoobs Pack 1 that way they will know where each other are then run the pimpbot exe to do the rest.</p>

      You have to download both files. Then you open the pack1.zip file. Then you have to find the part1 file. Then you have to find the path of the pack1.zip file. And then the installer will be extracted. And then it'll extract the files in two directories.<br />

      </blockquote>I really don't have any presets at all beacsuse I waited for the summer. I'm going to be done with my examns in about a week and then I'm going to start doing some presets.<br />
      <br />
      I will take a look at your presets and if I can maybe I'l even do a remix. I think I will be done with the presets in about 3 to 4 weeks.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      *Just took a look at your presets and they are good. I think I'm going to do some remixes and then do mine.
