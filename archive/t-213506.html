		I'm so sick of Render/Text, I toyed with the idea of making text2.ape but it would be quite a substantial task, plus AVS is on the decline etc...

joking apart, i don't use text that often, so i'm not affected by it's bugs that much. So, for me that ape isn't essential.

		render text is fine for what it does. the only thing that is really missing is multiline text. <br />
<br />
on the other hand. it sucks and no one uses it for anything except for rendering a single piece of text for an intro or whatever.

I disagree, half the time it doesnt even render text because it bugs out.<br />
<br />
I think it irritates me mainly because it isnt as dynamic as I need it to be, you can make a dynamic version of any of the components using ssc's DM's movements etc... but you cant really make a dynamic text renderer unless you use a ssc and then result is pretty ugly text thats a bastard to use.

		I use it for displaying global var values.<br />
<br />
I know the debug window also displays them, but to have it in your window can be quite useful imo<br />
<br />
I agree with J about the lack of multi-line text.

I've never experienced this. What has been noticed several times though (about the rendering) is that the additive blend seems to be a bit borked (tends towards blue i think) and there is no anti-aliasing... which need I remind you is FREE!!!!! yes FREEE i.e. no slow down, no bad side, no drawbacks.<br />
<br />
god i hate it when people dont implement something extra when its free on resources...<br />
<br />
anyway, yeah I agree the the text's renderer is poo and is another drawback to it.<br />
<br />
what else could be good is a codeable position and scale factor (rotation maybe?) so that text can be made aspect ratio correct etc... but that would be computationally expensive to implement.

		position is free, scale is free provided its equal both axis (i.e. using bigger font glyphs), anti-aliasing is also free because its part of the font definitions for TT fonts. Ah, so many possibilities, it aint ever gunna happen tho, lets face it.

Thats a nice made up phrase, you mean what coned called 'multiple pages'?<br />
<br />
I think formatting is important too, the current text does an ok job but if it was more like sprintf it would be more powerful

		<b>GO FOR IT!</b> <br />
<br />
quite a few ppl have thought about doing it but noone had the time/guts:).<br />
<br />
i think its the last big thing avs needs to be complete.<br />
<br />
not only would it make it easyer to get the text where   and when you want it, it would also optimise most curent text implementations a lot and make avs as a whole look a bit better. <br />
it could even be abused for animated sprites and stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
do it, preety please (with a cherry on top):)<br />
<br />
<br />
if you voted for poo here you go, now vote for text2 damit<br />

hmmmm, let me think about it....  Nope.<br />
<br />
wheather avs will live or die or whatever doesnt matter here. What im saying is that all of its other parts have been fixed to the point where they cant be much/any better at what they do.<br />
<br />
So if this would be fixed it wold be compleate in what it is. <br />
<br />
the attached preset is an exsample of just how crappy the current text is.I mean wtf it could just be a single render text if things were done the right way:/

		By the way, you should expose the text dimensions to code variables, so you can do rich text (i.e. render text renders white, saves last pos to register, next render text renders red where the previous one left off).<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could use color escape codes (a bit like mirc except not as sucky). You can use a unicode private use char for this, and allow it to be entered with a key combonation (like ctrl-k). Something like ^K0.2,0.2,0.2^K selects dark gray.<br />
<br />
Oh and word-wrapping support would be nice (it's easy to measure text with GetTextExtents or something like that).

		why not add a code box aswell instead of multi-line e.g.<br />
<br />
text: <br />
#!init 5<br />
<br />
code: <br />
some 3D shit... <br />
<br />
anyways why not make it an open source project on sound forge, I've seen lots of developers work and it might just attract new people... leading to the construction of this glorified 'openGL avs' ...
