<div class="posttext">sup ull...i need help with ssc im totally new to it ...i learned that T makes a figure move...but when i do it it makes the figure go outside the avs thing..how can i keep it in the avs thing? for example:<br />
point:<br />
<br />
u=i*2-1; <br />
x=u;y=(u*u)+cos(t+i); <br />
<br />
any help is greatly needed.. thanks<br />
<br />
oh check out my presets... pls tell me what u think about them...<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">t is not a built-in variable; you could call t 'thethingythatmakestheotherthingymovelikeitdoes' and it would do the same thing.<br />
<br />
The reason your scope is going out of range is because of your code:<br />
u=i*2-1;<br />
x=u; y=(u*u)+cos(t+i);<br />
Let's do some substitution...<br />
u=i*t-1;<br />
x=i*2-1; y=(x*x)+cos(t+i);<br />
If you've taken algebra 1 (or 2, depending on what class you're taking...), you'll realize that the reason the scope is going out of the window is you're essentially saying y=x^2, creating a parobolic curve.  That curve SHOULD be staying inside the window anyway, but the reason it's going out is the shift +cos(t+i).<br />
<br />
So...re-write it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">... go to this site (http://www.geocities.com/avsdiscussion) and check out the SuperScope tutorial I've written. Might be of use.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sadarqi: nice that you're writing a tutorial, but I just read through it and you seem to have forgotten some *essential* parts. When writing a tutorial, assume the reader doesn't know anything about the subject.<br />
<br />
For example, when you explain &quot;x and y&quot;, you say: &quot;They specify the shape, movement and the changes of the scope with time and music.&quot;.<br />
I'm sorry, but that says as much to me as &quot;AVS allows you to do purty things. w00t!&quot;.<br />
Why not just say &quot;these specify the position of the point in relation to regular X and Y axes&quot; and proceed to give some example coordinate sets? Perhaps a simple schematic drawing?<br />
You could add &quot;By cleverly calculating sets of x and y coordinates, you can achieve some very nice effects with the superscope&quot; instead of your &quot;They specify...&quot; sentence.<br />
<br />
Second, &quot;i&quot;. You say: &quot;i - the initial length of the scope.&quot;<br />
This insinuates that 'i' has a direct relationship to the length of the graph... it's just a progress variable to identify the current point. Nothing more. You can of course say that you can use it to draw simple lines, but that is not 'i', that's using it in a formula.<br />
<br />
Instead of jumping into examples, I think it'd be better if you simply explained each variable just as it is (what its value is in relation to what), and only *then* say how you can use them to draw shapes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'll keep your advice in mind UnCodeD. I was just trying to write a tutorial that would, in my opinion, be quite understandable to a person who is novice in this. Your comments are reasonable but some of the definitions may be confusing to a rookie (&quot;...progress variable to identify the current point...&quot;). :) I've only written the SSC tutorial. The rest was written by Linus. By the way, the adds that have seemed to irritate you so much are now gone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">see my attached explanation on x &amp; y axis &amp; other algebra stuff.  Note that copying the text or the graphics in part or in whole is plagiarism if you don't give credit.  I'm cool as long as you give credit where credit is due --(but this is a **preview** to what my book will look like; even though it's just one of the introductory chapters).<br />
<br />
Note that the information in the word document is correct to my knowledge, but it may have errors.<br />

<div class="posttext">thanks to all of u who responded...<br />
<br />
to Sadarqii:<br />
u noe with geocities u can stop the ads by adding this to the end of the html code<br />
....&lt;noembed&gt; <br />
add that at the very end of ur code...</div></div><hr />
