      Hi, guys,<br />
      First of all I will apoligize for being a newbie, so forgive me if this sound like a stupid question.<br />
      For a bit now I have been using AVS Grabber to record visualizations from AVS Editor to an .avi file, but I have been noticing that their are more and more people creating their own visualizations by means of creating their own AVS plugins. Is there a way to grab those visualizations from other AVS plugins?, not just the AVS Ediitor.<br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Those aren't AVS Presets, but other vis plugins written ib C++ and other languages. You probably want to search Google for a screen capture program.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try SnaggIt, it's a really nice capture program. It can make AVI's realtime, or make JPEG's every second, or on button push, whatever you like. It has a lot of options, and I believe there is a freeware version of it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey Dameon,<br />
      After posting this a while ago, I figured out how to use the AVS grabber, to capture the Visualizations, and then using Virtual Dub, compress the files, so that I can burn the visualizations onto CD. I was doing great at it for a while, until latley I have noticed that alot of the new visualizations that people were posting, couldn`t be captured by the AVS Grabber, which I am not guite sure why. So now I have to come up with another way, and when I revisted your post, I saw the Snagit program you mentioned and tried. I like the program, and as you said it is alot easier, however, I was wondering, with the AVS grabber I knew that I could replay the AVI at full screen, however when I capture it using Snagit I can display it at full screeen however, regarless what player I play the .avi in, It apprears almost as widescreen format with the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. I was wondering if you have had any problems with this, or could offer any solution to show it in full screen format. I want to be able to burn it onto a SVCD at full screen so the full image is top to bottom without the black bars, and I am not quite sure how to accomplish this using Snagit.<br />
      Hopefully you can help,<br />
      Thanks,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey,<br />
      Thanks of the info I really apreciate it.<br />
      One other question for you guys.<br />
      Like I say I have snagit, and figured out how to use it, and love it. I also noticed that it has a plugin for Microsofts Power Point, but it can only capture screen still of Microsoft Power point, and not the entire presentation. Is there a way to use snag it to capture Power Points presentation down to a avi, file and then burn it on to dvd, or even if there is another way it can ben done it be verry much apreciated. I am sorry for asking all these questions but the club I work for curently has a dvd player, with the prospect of getting Numarks DVD01, so I am looking for different ways of using DVD videos instead of trying to run it from a video card with multiple video outs. Also If any one has any additional links for AVS presets or visualizations, please post them.<br />
      Any Advice is greatly apreciated.<br />
      Thanks,<br />
