			<strong>Full Screen not Wide Screen</strong><br />
		
		

		Here is a screen shot of my visualization. It is in wide screen. How can I make it so when it is in full screen mode, the black bars aren't there? Also how do I keep it from displaying the &quot;Loading...&quot;, and the name of the preset at the bottom right, when in random mode?<br />

		go to the editor (right click on the avs window), go to the fullscreen settings via the settings menu and set the vertical screen height to 100. you can supress the text in the same dialog.

		sorry... should have searched forum. But just checked FAQ, and not in there. It does tell you how to configure avs, but it says to &quot;double-click the avs display and the configuration dialog should open up.&quot; But when I double-click the avs display it just goes to full screen mode??? Is the faq for older versions?

		no<br />
you have to go into the avs setup located in the avs editor.<br />
right click the avs window and click the option called avs editor and there will be a menu selection called settings and select fullscreen then click the option that says &quot;when double click go to fullscren instead of avs editor&quot; or something of the like. I hope that helps.<br />
<br />
and the answer to the FAQ is yes.<br />
The Faq has not been updated in sometime.<br />
Unconed is the one to pester about that.
