      <p class="post-content"><strong>Someone have pitty on me (a frustrated newbie)</strong><br />
      I have searched the FAQ's high and low, found advice, suggested plug-ins, and I am about at the end of my rope. I am trying to get my visualizations to work. Everytime I try to start one, I get "no mmx support found-cannot run avs get the non mmx version". I installed the program from this (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=122340&amp;highlight=MMX" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....&amp;highlight=MMX</a>) thread, and I "still" get the same error message. Would someone please help me or point me in the right direction?<br />
      <br />
      I've been trying to fix this myself because I know the answer has to be out there already, but I am not finding it, so I am apologizing in advance. If anyone can save me from my misery, I will be your slave for life!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I would reccommend getting a newer computer. I don't know why that program didn't work; I have no personal experience of it. Any computers after the early Pentium I's will have MMX.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It'd probably be cheaper and much more worthwhile just to get a new processor and install it yourself...that and getting a new computer with a decent OS (read: NOT winxp) costs even more money nowadays.<br />
      But I don't see why you couldn't run AVS with the non-MMX AVS version... :/</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, after a few more hours of trying everything I could think of, I finally got the avs to work in the winamp 2 version, but couldn't get the full screen to work, which means I just have to sit really close to get hypnotized I guess. Better than nothing I suppose though. =/</p>
