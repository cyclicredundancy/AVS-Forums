		I can't stand it any longer I keep trying to put it on and it just wont let me do it. I put on the correct jpeg formated pictures, even though i still dont know how to make a screen shot of a vizualization. I just made a jpeg with none available written on it. <br />
I can't get my vizuals on that site its driving me crazy. Please if you know how to im begging you to tell me thank you.<br />
<br />
On my knees,<br />

		I don't think you can post an AVI on Winamp.<br />
<br />
Yopu can snag a screenshot by hitting alt-printscreen when the AVS window is active. Where on winamp are you trying to post this pic?

		All you do is, when you get to the submit screen, click the browse button beside the image text box. Then you find your image. That's all I know, and it worked for me.

		Usually people submit the actual presets instead of a screenshot or screenmovie.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, capturing them as pixel-doubled only makes the image larger, but adds no detail.

		Each one of these things, these visualizations you make in AVS, are called presets. Just another name for the same thing. Sorry to get your hopes up.<br />
<br />
Do you have a pack ready to publish?

			<strong>Yes I do....</strong><br />
		
		

		Yes I currently have 6 avs to publish, I just found out yesterday to switch them to .exe but now i have trouble with making a thumnail.<br />
I still havn't had anyone look at mine am i doing something wrong or do they just look boring?<br />
What you have to do is copy and past them into the avi folder of your winamp program on your hard drive its a pain but i dont know of a better idea. Im no programer and don't have certain programs. Just netzip and an absesion with getting these look at by another person.

		I assume you used PiMP to make them into a zip file.  If you check out the developers section of the Winamp website, you can find some documentation on how to set the output directories.<br />
<br />
But when you post stuff in the forums, it isn't required to PiMP your presets-(but it's normal to PiMP them whenever you publish them on the main Winamp website).  I've gotten a little rusty on my PiMPing skills, but I could probably do it if I took a look at what you're trying to do.  You can do all sorts of advanced stuff with PiMPing.<br />
<br />
Even though I may not be able to answer all of your questions, if you ask a specific question, I'm sure the rest of the forum will help out if you ask them a specific question about PiMPing. :)<br />
<br />
:) Just a friendly message from C. Mountford :)<br />
<br />
--Edit--:  You probably the reply I made in the AVS Presets sub-forum :)

		I have mad pimping skilz :cool:<br />
<br />
Well, not really. I just want to say I've got mad pimping skilz. :)<br />
<br />
As to the jpeg thing the started this whole thing, still no idea.<br />
<br />
You'd probably get better results with posting your presets in the preset subforum. If these are your first presets, I'd advise against publishing them on winamp, just because they won't accurately reflect what you can do, and may discourage you when the untamed masses (people who can't or won't write a decent critique) rip in.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Just took a look at you presets. Some of them are fairly nice, some I didn't like. One thing you have to remeber is any prestes you actually publish with be compaed the Unconed's, El-Vis', Duo's, and heck, even mine if anyone even bothers to look at it with a rating of 3 and 1/2 stars. (I thought it was pretty darn good too (The first person to review it obviously didn't think so):( )<br />
