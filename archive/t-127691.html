<br />
<div class="posttext">Intro - Alright, but screen is very empty and it's nothing spectacular<br />
Addicated v2 - Awesome.  This is the way to use moving particles.  Great job<br />
Bubblegum - Nice movement.  Very smooth.<br />
Cold white light - Nice, but could use something a bit more exciting.  Maybe change the starfield to a dot SSC.<br />
Darklight - Not very reactive, but alright for a waterbump preset.<br />
Electro - Don't really like the bump texture, but it's alright<br />
Electro remade - Flashes a bit too much and I don't like the moving particles.<br />
Firestarter - weird shape.  Needs some smoother edges too.<br />
Fractal (lemon) - Very unique fractal.  Try speeding it up - it looks much better with faster music.<br />
Fractal (slow-mo metallic) - like the effect more with this one.<br />
Free your mind (extra groovy rmx) - Interesting ripple effect, but I don't really like the lines<br />
FrostBeam - Nice light effect.  Would look better if there were a few more lights and it cleared the screen a bit more often<br />
Geisha - Nice scope, but not much effect wise.  Decent preset.<br />
Gridders - kinda boring.  Needs to do a bit more.<br />
Lavalamp - would look a bit better with some better colors.<br />
Nuclear blobs - OK except for the water/blur/bump glitch.<br />
Nuclear blobs v3 - much nicer than the previous one.<br />
Pastel panels - Nice, but the edges between the white and the pastels is a bit messed up<br />
Pastel panels (heavily boosted) - effect isn't as nice, but the speed helps make it difficult to see the edges caused by the gridsize.<br />
Reebok - Seen similar effects before, but it's nice<br />
Skies fall in - very weird colors.  Would like it a bit more with white clouds instead of those unrealistic looking flames.<br />
Sky diving - nice smooth preset, except the superscopes are too blocky<br />
Venom - nice movement, but don't like the gray color.<br />
Volcano - nice colors and movement.<br />
Worms (high electricity) - Movement needs to be a bit more dynamic, but it's nice<br />
Geisha remade - Nice.  Movement could be more dynamic, but it's very nice<br />
Overall: 4.0  Nice job, and I love your use of MP's in Addicated.  Great overall pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i will give 4,<br />
although i like the presets a lot, <br />
there are some people, who after publishing their presets, make the other packs small. :) <br />
UnconeD for example.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">His packs are a great size for their difficulty.  In terms of hours of being able to watch his packs - he is far superior to most people who have packs with 30+ presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm currently updating some presets from the pack and trying to pimp the pack with the Nsis 2 for Winamp version. That can take awhile, so I was wondering if anyone would be interested to make couple remixes for the Wa-dot-com version then I would have that Ã¼berl33t remix section in my pack too.Big choco-cookie and latte for every remixer !!! ;) <br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks for the comments, appreciated !</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">2-3 sounds good. And no need to rush, I'll probably publish it in the first days of april or so...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Great work. I liked moast of the presets(all except firestarter and that first fractal). My favs are Free yore mind rmx, Lava lamp and remakes of Fury(cant remember the name). Thing that imressed me the most is the coloring and how you made all of the colors work so good whith each other and whith the shapes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 18:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Intro: I like the shake effect, but needs more. 3/5.  <br />
Addicted v2: Very nice. The colors are perfect, and the bump is well used. One of my favs. 4.75/5. <br />
BubbleGum: Also very nice, but I don't like the colors as much. Still very vibrant though. The DM isn't as &quot;fun&quot; as Addicted either. 4.25/5.<br />
Cold White Light RMX: More great colors, but other than that, this one is kind of boring. I suggest using a Superscope instead of a Starfield so you have more control over the dots. 3.5/5.<br />
Darklight: Looks flashy, but it doesn't do much. Could be more. I want to see a version two of this preset. 3.25/5.<br />
Electro: Once again, nice choice of colors. I'd like to see some sound reactivity, though. 4/5.<br />
Electro Remade: I wish you would use Scopes instead of MP's. I like the colors, but the quickness of this preset. Slow it down, and use Scopes for maximum control. 3.75/5.<br />
Firestarter: I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but it looks kind of cool. Make it do more, though. Also, it could be faster. 3.5/5.<br />
Fractal (Lemon): Neat, but gets boring quickly. Like the colors, though. 3.75/5.<br />
Fractal (Slo-Mo Metallic): I like this more than the lemon version. It's faster and has even better colors. 4/5. <br />
Free Your Mind RMX: I don't like this one much, mostly because it has that every-other-pixel look from the water/blur. 3.25/5.<br />
Frostbeam: I've seen this effect before, but you used it nicely. 3.75/5.<br />
Geisha: Nice usage of Texer. Excellent colors as well. 4.5/5.<br />
Gridders: Stylish, but doesn't do much. Could be more; work on it. 3.5/5.<br />
Lavalamp: Very nice. Just add more sound reactivity. 4.25/5.<br />
Nuclear Blobs: Needs sound reactivity. The shifting bump doesn't cut it. 3.25/5.<br />
Nuclear Blobs v2: Again, needs more reactivity. Looks better than the last one, though. 3.75/5.<br />
Pastel Panels: Excellent! Very nice colors, and great style. Also, it doesn't try to be more than it is. 4.5/5.<br />
Pastel Panels Reworked: Although the changes are minute, this one has its own look and feel from the last one, and is faster. 4.5/5.<br />
Reebok: Excellent colors. Great use of bump as well. This is one of my favorites. 4.75/5.<br />
Skies Fall In: Nice colors, but looks too random. I think a better DM is needed. 3.5/5.<br />
Skydiving: I like this one. Great colors, and a reactive DM. 4.5/5.<br />
Venom: Basicly just like Cold White Light, but with a better DM. I like the shifting colors. 3.75/5.<br />
Volcano: Awesome colors! Like the DM, too. Just get rid of those ugly edges somehow. 4.5/5.<br />
Worms (Hi-Electricity): Very nice. I love the metaballs like effect. Excellent colors and DM. 4.5/5.<br />
Geisha (Remade): Looks great! I just wish the DM was more sound/beat reactive. A cross between the default DM and the last one would be great. 4.5/5.<br />
<br />
Overall: Great pack, with amazing colors. Just work on you Dynamic Movements and keep experimenting with 3D. Also, never neglect to make you presets sound or beat reactive. 4.2/5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice remixes.  The gridders is much better than the original IMO.  The others are about the same.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you really want to know.. I'm... doing... Nothing :D  Just kidding, thanks for the remixes I liked 'em all ! As soon as I get the script example from Tug I can finish my own script (just need to do some banners and try to detect the avs folder with assistance of winamp.ini (not sure is that possible tho))</div></div><hr />
