      <p class="post-content"><strong>A couple questions</strong><br />
      1. What is the easiest way to create a solid superscope<br />
      <br />
      2. What is the easiest way to write code to do 3d movement in dynamic movement. I want to be able to "zoom" with adding 1 to z, and pan by adjusting x and y. The final result can be in either d or x/y coordinates.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I can help you with your first question<br />
      <br />
      the very best example ive seen on how to do this came from someone asking about how to make a good square. (see attachment)<br />
      <br />
      (I AM REALLY SORRY, BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CANNOT REMEMBER WHO MADE THIS(it was posted recently)<br />
      <br />
      see, they just made a ziggy(?) line and set it the "n" var to 800 so you couldnt tell<br />
      <br />
      try setting it to 30<br />
      <br />
      also, the line width func on the misc-&gt;set render mode is <u>very</u> helpful<br />
      <br />
      im sorry i cant help you on your second question :(<br />
      <br />
      (remember, just waste your life with superscopes and you might (i havent yet)understand them)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Zooming isn't that hard. Just multply x and y by the inverse of your zoom factor.<br />
      <br />
      eg.<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      zoom = 1.5;<br />
      zf = 1/zoom;<br />
      <br />
      pixel:<br />
      x=x*zf;<br />
      y=y*zf;<br />
      <br />
      To move around, just do it the way you would normally. (x=x+whatever)<br />
      <br />
      I made a preset once that did something like that. Feel free to dissect and stuff.</p>

      </blockquote>That one is actually quite simple since you don't have to do any rotaions (so it will be pretty fast too)<br />
      <br />
      just put something like this in the last box<br />
      <br />
      x1=x;<br />
      y1=y;<br />
      z1=z;<br />
      <br />
      x=x1/(k+s*z1);<br />
      y=y1/(k+s*z1);<br />
      <br />
      where k and s are constants you choose to alter the strength and scale of the perspective calculation. that is the based of doing a 3d projection onto a 2d plane.
