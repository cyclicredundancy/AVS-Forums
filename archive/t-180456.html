      <p class="post-content"><strong>That darn extra pixel</strong><br />
      Hey, first post so please pardon any stupidity on my part. Anyhow, I've been doing avs's for a whiloe and have continuing problem with circular stuff. I have an extra point appearing at the end. I think it relates somehow to the 'i' variable but I can't seem to trim the end off. An example is in the following preset. So, what causes this extra pixel and how can I remove it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, silly me, I just had a revelation. I think that dar extra pixel is related to 'v', not 'i'. Perhaps the getosc command will help? I can try that later, suggestions an solution still welcome.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No you didn't you addd a little code and made it into lines but if you stop the music you see a little line going and comming from the sides, perpendicular to the main line. Also, if you convert it back to dots it's still there.<br />
      Oh, one more thing, what's that SKIP command, I've heard of arrays and other non-documented commands and variables but, is there alist of them somewhere that's public? Also, is there a way to carry a variable from one ssc to another (i.e. reference rand number from ssc1 into ssc2)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">skip stops a pixel being drawn. What I did was increasing P for every point in the scope, and setting skip to 1 if p=800 (means that no point is set at the 800th point of the line). But you need one of the newest versions of AVS to make it work. If you still see the dot, you probably have an older version, because I don't see it anymore, not at pixelmode too. (newest version is 2.81b). comes standard with WinAmp5.01 and higher.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, thanks' for the frendly comment. Anyhow, perhaps I can rephrase. Is there a solution to winamp 2.x? Also, what causes this problem? Also, What I meant was not the .avs file was: can I update the plugin without updating winamp?</p>

      <p class="post-content">winamp 5 does not use more RAM or CPU than winamp 2<br />
      if you dont use modern skins, winamp5 is just 100 kb bigger than winamp2 in memory.<br />
      Winamp5 AVS is even faster than winamp2 AVS because the scripting engine has been improved/sped up a lot.<br />
      so, installing wa5 is never a bad thing, especially if you want to do avs on a slow comp :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I've noticed the problem before. The value of v at one end of i becomes &gt;0 even if no music is playing. It only happens when n is larger than 1000. I think it is fixed in the latest update of Winamp though, haven't checked.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To answer jccaclimber's question: you can try copying Winamp 5's vis_avs.dll into Winamp 2's plugins directory, but I'm not sure if it'll work due to the visualiser being integrated and all.</p>
