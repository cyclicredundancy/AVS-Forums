<div class="posttext">i know this has been talked about a million times, but i just wanted to state my feelings. im sitting here in the australian sun, sipping a nice cold beer at 1.30pm and listenning to my favourite music (which is psytrance). now i have a plugin called R4 running which of course supports multimonitors and has some great features, while that is all fun and good it doesnt have anywhere near the amount of presets and such available as what AVS does. the fact that avs has soo many options and capabilities it would be hard to replicate the same preset. i soo much wanted AVS to work on my second monitor and infact to use it to project onto my wall using a projector.. i know i can change the primary monitor around and im aware of how to do this, but it creates incompatibilities in other programs. and it also flickers quite freequently for me, showing the mouse cursor and desktop icons sometimes. i only wish nullsoft could of added multimonitor support before they closed up shop and moved on..<br />
<br />
in any case, im most pleased with winamp5 and its stability and features and will continue to use it for many years, i highly doubt there would be much point moving to another program unless it had a wizzbang visual display thingy to accompany it.<br />
<br />
just a mindless rand after i got sun-stroke.. sorry about bad spelling &amp; grammer<br />
<br />
have a good day all. and thanks nullsoft!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">avs is everything but stable. if you do a lot of coding presets you know that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">all the more reason (seeing as winamp is now dead). release the source to AVS to people can work on it and make it bigger &amp; better. giving winamp more life!</div></div><hr />
