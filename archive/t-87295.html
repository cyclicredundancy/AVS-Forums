      Does anyone know if it is possible to have a user defined variable with a different value for each point that is saved from one frame to the next?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I do not think so...If you like to store values you have to setup manually a var for every single point which is for high n almost impossible.<br />
      <br />
      If you like to store the current look of the SSC you might use buffers i.e. like this<br />
      <br />
      ...+effectlist ignore ignore active on beat 1 frame<br />
      ......-SSC<br />
      ......-save buffer<br />
      ...-restore buffer (or DynamicMovement using buffer)<br />
      <br />
      unfortunately with this setup it is impossible to do smooth fluid changes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what you want to accomplish, but I managed to 'store' particle-positions (Whacko AVS II: The Source) by using a seedable random number generator. Because I reset the seed every frame, it always generates the same numbers. Of course, you don't have much control over it, but it's a start.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, I think Whackos THE SOURCE will be the right thing for you then because for a starfield you'll need no music values only more or less randomly set points.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's what I have so far. I still have to toss in a movement before the rotation, but am running into a snag with looping the stars. :(<br />

      Very nice so far. Only thing is that these single pixel stars look a little small.<br />
      <br />
      I messed with the setup to make 'em look bigger and attached the file. Instead of multiple fastbrightnesses you perhaps better use unconeds multiplier ape out of whackoIV.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm... I like the single pixel stars myself.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, got the looping down, now I'm trying to rig the movement to follow the rotation (so that you'll always be flying forwards, nomatter how you're facing)<br />
      <br />
      It looks much better with the movement IMHO. :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think if you rotate a unit vector (0,0,1) along with your stars, and move the camera in that direction, it should work.</p>

      Wow, love this additional movement. I wonder if it is possible to do some bulks of stars or galaxys...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't see why not, just generate random nuber weighted toward the middle of the spectrum (don't ask me how to do that though :igor: ).<br />

      The major problem would be speed.</p>

      I almost have it. Actually, I think it looks pretty good the way it is but something is bugging me. I can't for the life of me figureout why the camera sometimes gets turned around. Could someone point me in the right direction?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, that's because of the rotation of the movement vector (mx,my,mz). That out that rotation in the perframe section and just set them init if you don't want it to change direction.<br />
      <br />
      This one's kinda been moved to the back burner for me. Working on making a sphere with a DM right now.</p>
