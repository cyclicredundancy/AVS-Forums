<div class="posttext">I have an idea...<br />
<br />
I'd like to have a feature that will let me click through the AVS window.. I, as well as a few others that I've told the idea about have thought it was cool.... here is a picture that might help you see why:<br />
<br />
click:<br />

<br />
I'd like to be able to have the visuals on top of everything i do... like, full screen with it being highly transparent, but still be able to browse around and stuff<br />
<br />
feedback from other WA users is appreciated</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS runs too slowly already at fullscreen, so adding support for that would make it too slow, and would slow down doing other things.<br />
Good idea, but not practical (if even possible) with AVS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea.. I have it transpart, but i'd like to have it highly transparent, and then be able to click through it to use other windows while its going.... it looks really cool transpart stretched out over my whole screen, but i cant keep using other apps with it up :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">doing that wouldn't work with the new version of AVS which allows the use of the mouse in presets.  AVS wouldn't know whether your clicking was meant to be for programs behind the AVS window or for the AVS window itself.<br />
<br />
I don't think this will become a reality.  One possibility to get a similar effect would be to get a geforce4 or above(i believe all of these cards can do this) and use the nview options for all of your different program windows to make them partially transparent(you can choose the %transparency).  This way it would possibly look the same as what you are wanting.  The only disadvantage is that you have to spend a few bucks.  Older nvidia cards may also have this feature, but I just remember it from my ti-4600.  Check their website to find out for sure if you want to do this.  lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont think it notices the diference   as it is. you exlude the ones that are out of the window in your code (if you want) so that shouldnt be such a prob. and you could always just use the presets that have no mouse control:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">but he's wanting to run the avs fullscreen on top of all the other apps.  if it's fullscreen, then none of the other programs will be &quot;outside&quot; the avs window.  So you wouldn't be able to click on them.  Or if you go the other route, then you wouldn't be able to click on the avs window.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">anubis: yea.. I see what you're saying... but you definately get what I was trying to do...<br />
<br />
I have a geforce4 ti4200... I guess I'll look for those transparency settings<br />
<br />
