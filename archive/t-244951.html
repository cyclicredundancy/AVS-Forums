      Ok your wondering why is a noob challenging the pros. heres the reason a long time ago Pak-9 made a game called avs blox and well i think its time for another or few to be made. the topics of choice to use are tron old arcade version, play mame and you'll get the idea. discs of tron, Space Invaders, Pacman "this should be easy", or my personal fav the Light cycles from tron. heh i think that might cover it but if you have more ideas then use them. also i don't care how crappy your coding may be in this subject but if you need help in making the engine hell ask PAK-9 he might have a clue or too. your allowed 4 presets per submition. also the games thing is not limited to 3d if you can do it ^_^'. heheheheh enjoy. also who ever makes the most ideal game will have its link posted on visual noobs and i will post the how to make games in avs document. opps i forgot that part your also required to make a how to document no more then 3 pages of single spaced size 12 arial document.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wha ? What on earth does music response have to do with games ? The point of this game is to get to the gate in the distance. Sure, the game's a bit ugly, simple and damn easy, but at least he tried. Did you really think that all the pros will jump and make games, which are quite hard to do properly by the way, only because you, erm, challenged them ?<br />
      <br />
      By dissing the only person who actually made something, without any sensible reason, I'm betting that you just alienated those few who would've actually made something. Way to go.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So no one remembers pak-9's AVS Blox from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/22355663/" target="_blank">PAK-9 AVS 5</a>? Hehe, i would laugh maliciously, but it's a really good game, better than most tetris clones in fact.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, i think doggy said it already, i doubt that anyone is going to do anything just because you "challenge" them and if you start insulting people who actually do make something then i think you will drive everyone away. I certainly wouldn't want to make anything for this challenge now, not that i was planning on doing anything in the first place.<br />
      <br />
      And it certainly doesn't help that you're new around here either, maybe if someone known and trusted threw together a competition like this (or any competition for that matter) people would get excited, heck throw in a couple of real prizes for the first 3 and im sure everyone would get cracking immediately!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Bravo! Right, wrong or otherwise, you have close to no credibility in the AVS community, as of yet. Jumping right in, only a month ago, with a few noobish remixes and a very young website, still with no documentation on, and I quote: "...how to program avs and how to present them. also to help you get your packages known and skills unveiled," almost a month later, challenging the community to a very difficult and rather unexplored sector of AVS is not going to get you very far. Especially as you<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry</strong><br />
      Everyone is right. i had no reason to say that earth man. anyway i am quite pleased with your submition. you have 3 more to make think you can do it. also i would like to say i'm sorry for what i said. you see i made that post before even looking at your preset and well i'm sorry for that. i need to know. sense your so good with the noobish 3d codes you think you can make it as a programmer for Visualnoobs.<br />
      <br />
      also in response to Tuggumis response to the prizes thing.<br />
      <br />
      Bite me. i can't hand out prizes because that demoralizes the reason i invented Visualnoobs with Florins help.<br />
      Visualnoobs is designed for noobs so they can learn the trade without reward. so going on about that the Winter Sports game is good but the mouse control is needing refinement<br />
      i'll give you the asc codes for the keyboard as in pak-9s avs blox. ok never mind theres to many to note. so back to business. again i'm sorry for that post. can we just be friends again. please.<br />
      ok and UnConeD i'm interested in the pingpong preset think you can send it to me in an email?.</p>

      Sure i took your text out of context, you could say that, but you also took my text out of context.

      Ok, back to reality. You just lucked out on that one. The database is broken, and so's the user ability to rate. Your pack has been on the top of the most recent AVS presets queue for a month now, the fact that it's on top, combined with the bloated rating thanks to your moronic self rate (which we couldn't kill, and which couldn't get any reviews that would get it to the number it deserves (3 tops). Your pathetic attempt at giving yourself some semblance of importance is laughable. Your pack isn't even worthy enough to be mentioned with The Great Escape in the same sentence. You're not even the most talented or best newbie around. I can think of at least 6 better ones on top of my head, including your buddy fastingaciu. Yes, I did say you had some nice ideas in my review, but I was in a good mood, and I was being nice. You're not the underdog, you're not the hero of the masses. You're just a newbie with a Napoleon complex. Ok ? The only thing that can be admired about you is your ability to step on the toes of everyone that would have the skill and the will to help you. That is really, really, impressive.

        <p class="post-content"><strong>you know what</strong><br />
        I don't care if i get banned for saying this but that self rating i give to myself if i note does not say anything about my preset i was only thanking the winamp staff for their increased rating of my packs. and on the further note sure i have been on a rampage lately but you know what i've been having issues here at home lately, family member dying and junk and current finance issues. so if you can please leave the negative stuff down. i know i've been a jerk but this is the last time i even speak on the post unless its not negative and its about the challenge. anyway how about this why don't we just forget what i said in the past and try to do the challenege i'm not asking it for me i'm asking it for all the noobs out there that need help currently learning the code. if i remember correctly Pak-9 made a guide called Avs Programing Guide and i was quite moved by the moto that was in it.<br />
        Read and Forget<br />
        Write and Remember<br />
        Do and Understand<br />

        I didn't really read the whole thread till tonight and I just saw Doggy Dog's post. What did I do?<br />

              Ok, back to reality. You just lucked out on that one. The database is broken, and so's the user ability to rate. Your pack has been on the top of the most recent AVS presets queue for a month now, the fact that it's on top, combined with the bloated rating thanks to your moronic self rate (which we couldn't kill, and which couldn't get any reviews that would get it to the number it deserves (3 tops). Your pathetic attempt at giving yourself some semblance of importance is laughable. Your pack isn't even worthy enough to be mentioned with The Great Escape in the same sentence. You're not even the most talented or best newbie around. I can think of at least 6 better ones on top of my head, <b>including your buddy fastingaciu</b>. Yes, I did say you had some nice ideas in my review, but I was in a good mood, and I was being nice. You're not the underdog, you're not the hero of the masses. You're just a newbie with a Napoleon complex. Ok ? The only thing that can be admired about you is your ability to step on the toes of everyone that would have the skill and the will to help you. That is really, really, impressive.

          Just put you as an example of a newbie that's better than him, because you sure as hell are, and because he dropped your name once or twice.</p>
