<div class="posttext">Hello. This is the first time when I show some of my presets to someone else. I like them a lot but I don't know if somebody else likes them also.<br />
<br />
What I want to say is that ALL the presets are made entirely by me, and nothing is copied (though some of them look copied :)) I have included all my presets in the archive, maybe you could tell me if there is something interesting among them all.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Do you mind not putting your files into a .rar file, but in a .zip file instead? Not everybody is using winrar.<br />
As AVS filesizes are small anyway, the better compression ratio doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
Wow! you may be new, but these presets are *really* good for a first internet-release. Not beginner-like at all!<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could make a selection of the best of these presets (like 15 to 25 presets or so) and submit it on winamp.com or create a www.deviantart.com page to release it there, where a lot of people can review it. (I have one too) <br />
Installers can be easily made with pimpbot (http://www.visbot.net/index.php?p=15)<br />

Welcome to the Winamp AVS forums!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow! I didn't expect such a good reaction! Thanks.<br />
<br />
Of course I will make a selection of all that, because there is a lot o crap there. Personally I think that there are about 5 &quot;commercial&quot; presets. <br />
<br />
Here are the files in .zip format :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If we look at the coding, it's no beginner stuff at all :)<br />
But usually presets need a lot more than just one single superscope or a dm. Though i don't know if this is just your experiment folder or what, but if you do plan on releasing a pack then i recommend you try to get on a preset more than that one superscope ;)<br />
<br />
Nice stuff and welcome :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">SWEET JESUS! This is all your stuff? WOW!<br />
This is some awesome work! I love the fractal ones and your 3D work is amazing! Great job!<br />
My only critisizm is this:<br />
Try not to have as many black backgrounds, throw in an invert at the end or a colour map, and they'll look even better! That and try to build-up your dynamic-movement skills. I'm really looking forward to a finished pack!<br />
Great work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well... Tuggummi you are right! That is my experiments directory and I know that it is not yet as good as I would like. And I will work on it and when I think it's done I will release it.<br />
<br />
I am very very glad that there are at least some guys who don't think it's all crap. Nice forum and nice guys you have here!<br />
<br />
Here's an unreleast pack, for the lazy ones, who don't like to unzip and stuff. This is an installer version, but it does not contain all of my presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very very nice for a first post. Creative coding, correct aspect ratio and everything ;). Some of the scopes remind of Jheriko's stuff.<br />
<br />
The sferas are very nice their simplicity.<br />
<br />
A couple of things:<br />
<br />
- You don't use any Texer 2's anywhere. Any particular reason? Texer 2 comes with Winamp5 and is much better than Texer 1: it renders directly, supports scaling &amp; blend modes, ...<br />
<br />
- When you make your presets onbeat responsive, make sure they start off similarly to what happens after a beat. Many of your 'cub' presets zoom in until the first beat.<br />
<br />
- A good effect needs good finishing. You should try playing more with colors &amp; composition. Just rotating over the spectrum gives rather boring presets (I know I did that a lot in my earlier stuff). Also try doing more than just onbeat response. Vary speeds based on overall volume, make some elements connected to different parts of the spectrum, etc. A good preset suits any kind of music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The very simple motive why I'm not using the Texer2 is that I did most of theese presets before the Winamp 5 and I simply didn't have time to play with it.<br />
<br />
As for the colors and other I will do my best. And I will try to make the moves dependent on the overall sound level. Thank's for the idea :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you'r coding is definitely very interesting and different<br />
sign that you figured stuff out yourself, and didnt use others presets, very good. <br />
<br />
Very interesting how you'r doing the cube, quite nice idea, and fake bf culled sphere is nice too.<br />
<br />
Its always good to check others presets to see how they do something, and later use ideas you got.</div></div><hr />
