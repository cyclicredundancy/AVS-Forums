<div class="posttext">Greetings Pixlecoprs and Steven Wittens, this is a request for you :)<br />
<br />
My name is toqer, and I don't really have a lot of money, but if either of you cats could tweak your programs for me, I am one of those peoples that shows his appriciation with a $20 dollar bill and a funny VCD of me singing like a loon.  If you need a reference, ask Christophe Thibulte(another WA dev) he put some of my requests in his program kaillera, and I stoked him out nicely..<br />
<br />
I make my own karaoke VCD's and tear the karaoke house down with them.  I've tried using both your guys stuff and the file it produces just doesn't seem to be properly synchronized (I find this out when I start trying to sing to the lyrics)  On top of that the method used to produce the AVI files is very taxing on the system.<br />
<br />
What i'm wondering is... Is there a way to grab the AVS output the same way the nullsoft diskwriter plugin does?  I don't need to see what i'm grabbing, I just want framerate and synchronization. I wouldn't need to hear it either.  Sort of like a simulated AVS that dumps to a AVI instead of the screen. Just let me know if i'm being to cryptic.<br />
<br />
Another cool feature would be to automatically name the AVI based on the name of the MP3, much like the diskwriter plugin does.<br />
<br />
Just give me those two things and a snail mail address, and you'll find something nice in your stocking for christmas. I look forward to hearing from either of you guys :)<br />
<br />
yours truly<br />
<br />

<br />
This would be possible if we had access to the AVS source, but right now it's impossible to write an APE that can do this.<br />
<br />

<br />
This shouldn't be too hard...<br />
<br />
<br />
The fastest possible grabbing is the raw 32-bit mode: it simply dumps the AVS output to disk as 32-bit RGB0 data, but not all programs can read this. If you use a normal codec (or 'uncompressed video'), the color data has to be converted to 24-bit RGB first, which is what causes the slowdown.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do, I still have to fix it so that it automatically appends .avi to the filename (required for AVIFileOpen).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">RIGHT ON RIGHT ON :)<br />
<br />
Lemme see if I can get in touch with Justin or Christophe to find out if there is any tips they can through your way, been a while since I bugged them.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, with the AVS source you could make a seperate program that could make AVS AVI's which were synched to the music, and even attach the music to the AVI for you. That would be immensly useful and would surely save a ton of effort. You could add all kinds of extra features too... needless to say this post is a bit pointless because we don't have the AVS source. It would be nice if we could have it though, perhaps if someone asked someone from nullsoft really nicely then we could get a copy of it.<br />
<br />
(No, I do not just want a copy of the AVS source for my own devious purposes...:confused:)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, why wouldn't they give it out... the software is free so why not make the source free too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you could probably make an AVS AVI synched to music with some decent movie software and a plugin that'll really slow the music down for you...Imagine Zero-G III at 800x600 w/DM at 800x600...with 64 FPS! ;)</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you wasn't going for realtime capture, you could compress it while creating it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It'd be around 35 mb/min. I'd be willing to get a DVD burner, and burn a couple CDs onto one DVD for that kind of speed and quality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I want to say that this is the most sorely needed feature.  I do hope a solution will soon be available for capturing visualization, from AVS or even all others, where you have complete control over framerate and format.  Though I doubt a general purpose solution is possible where any visualization could be simulated at a particular frame rate, or even that one solution could simple real-time capture any visualization, being able to do so with the AVS would be incredible.  It's obviously possible to program in, too.<br />
<br />
Please post if you have any news about this.<br />
<br />
Can't wait..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you could try it with Snaggit. It's a picture or video capturing program. Captures nearly everything. Dunno for sure where to download it, but if you search it sho√∫ldn't be to hard to find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The whole point is that you could let a song-synced AVS render for 2 hours, say, to get a superior quality visualization in a movie file.  I don't need video capture as much as advanced non-real-time rendering.  I'd like to see what 1600 x 1200 60 FPS would look like!  And I wish I could do that with any visualization plugin, but surely this is a feature deserving of being included in the AVS.<br />

I must have been high/tired/both when I wrote my last post.. (there are lots of errors).<br />
