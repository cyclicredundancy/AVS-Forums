<div class="posttext">That was quick WotL! ;)<br />
<br />
As i said in that other thread, i'd like to participate in such a pack! Altough i haven't much time at the moment (like so often :() i'll try to bring in a preset, as long as you don't plan to release it during the next week!<br />
<br />
If there are others interested in such a pack, then what about a theme for this pack?<br />
<br />
My ideas to avoid discussion about the &quot;compilator&quot;:<br />
1.) Let WotL do it, if he wants, cause he had the idea at first.. or:<br />
2.) Let's vote in another poll between all those who have time and/or are interested...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't intend to re-do the ComPicks, thats was a selection of already created presets.<br />
<br />
Neither is it my inention to include it in WA, but more just a pack we do together.<br />
And since it's called community pack, those who don't frequent WA.com anymore don't need to be included if they don't feel a part of the wa.com community (not at all saying they're not a part of the AVS community of course) don't have to participate.<br />
<br />
I'd like it to be a pack with new presets just from those who frequent here, long-timers and newbs. The idea is to have fun with eachother, no matter the quality of the presets so newbs can come in as well, if they have something that's worth sharing.<br />
<br />
overall stated, a pack that says &quot;This is us&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's the way i interpreted it too. We should give this project a different name, to avoid confusion.<br />
What about calling it FORUM PACK for the time being? When the project is finished, we could choose a proper name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2005, 18:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No offense but I think the overall quality of the pack will be pretty low... mainly because most of you guys are stinking noobs! you make me sick you damn NOOOBS! I mean really, your going to need at least a 30% non-noob turnout or the pack will stink.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to sink the idea, but be pragmatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th January 2005, 21:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you're such a mean guy, pak!!<br />
And we don't stink, we've just not enough time to wash ourselfs!<br />
//runs away crying<br />
<br />
Joking apart, what is wrong about having a bit fun making presets? Do you fear that the community here on WA.com loses credit? Or are you just saying that you personally wouldn't be intrested in the pack, in case there are less than 30% high quality presets?<br />
<br />
Nevertheless it wouldn't be bad to keep a minimum level. We could achieve that with a theme-pack for example.<br />
...although i don't think that anyone who posted above is a noob. (provided that we understand the same by &quot;noob&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">who would be classed as a noob around here pak? i'm sure that any of the really new people wouldn't bother submiting something becuase they would understand that they can't make  high quality presets yet. i think the biggest problem with this pack will be the lack of submitions, not the quality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">let's just start and try to make this pack. We'll see how good or bad / extensive or scanty it becomes.<br />
Untill now we were only discussing formalities. it's time for some decissions, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">nice to have you with us in the end!<br />
Well, as far as I'm concerned you can make the intro, cause yours mostly turn out to be quite good.<br />
<br />
Now what kind of presets do we want to have? Shall we make a new one for the pack? If so, wouldn't it be good to have something like a theme or so?<br />
Or shall we just compile a favourite of our own presets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i see, but to me it is a bit too general. My idea was to have a pack with a more unified appearance, where all presets tend towards a same direction.<br />
We choose a keyword/topic/theme... and our presets have to deal with it... (hope now you know what i meant?!?)<br />
<br />
But it's also just a suggestion...</div></div><hr />

Hmm.. It turns out to be more difficult than i thought to find a proper idea...<br />

<div class="posttext">good theme for presets, but how does that represent us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, we are full of enrgy to make new unseen and extraordinary presets!! Aren't we?<br />
<br />
Well it was just an idea... and a quick one too...<br />
<br />
As i said it's realy hard to find a good theme. Perhaps we should just compile some presets that represent our styles (provided that we have one ;) )..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th January 2005, 11:00</div></div>

<div class="posttext">why don't we just all make a preset or 2 and compile them, no theme, no trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th January 2005, 12:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">of course we don't have to to search for a theme. (Especially not, when we don't have a good idea...) The whole thing was just an suggestion, to have a clue what to make...<br />
<br />
Then, who will manage the presets and compile them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't mind the compiling part..<br />
<br />
But it's another thing that I'm concerned about:<br />
<br />
^..^<br />
Mysterious W<br />
MaTTFURY<br />
Mr Nudge <br />
Pak-9<br />
WotL<br />
<br />
Those are the people who said to participate..<br />
Are there really only 6 active AVS'ers around here?!<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree on dumping the theme for the presets since noone has a really good one indeed. <br />
So: 2 presets per person, in you own style then, with PAK building the intro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th January 2005, 16:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">A theme that defines us...hmm, how about &quot;Stinkin noobs&quot;, no no wait &quot;noobs Vs Good Artists&quot;, no no, &quot;The noobs shall inherit the earth&quot; hehehe<br />
<br />
Is there any sort of vetting process for the pack? I mean, yunno.. a minimum level of quality required? Or a max number per submitter. And whats the minimum nuber of different submitters we can have to make up the pack? I suggest at least 6 different people to make it worth it.</div></div><hr />

However, WotL: can we send you the presets per email or shall we post them here? I was just wondering, cause if we would mail them it would be a bit more of a surprise when the pack finally is published.</div></div><hr />

For the name I'd say we stick with Community Pack  <br />
There is already a commuinty picks pack, but that was the one where people voted for their favorite presets. I think we should choose a different sounding mane so people won't get confused.</div></div><hr />

I think 'Forums Community Pack' is a good name but it needs to be qualified by which forum its referring to, i.e. 'Winamp.com AVS Forums Community Pack' or maybe just 'AVS Forums Community Pack' because its a bit shorter</div></div><hr />

i just thought that a simple name like &quot;winamp forums compilation one&quot; would be a good idea cause it seemed as if no real &quot;theme&quot; could be found. im sorry for any rash conclusion/decisions...<br />
<br />
so is the theme &quot;tugg vs pak&quot; now, or what? im getting confused.. :igor: but this theme would indeed only be good if tugg took part with a preset or two and if the others would remix/re-do some pak/tugg presets...<br />

<div class="posttext">there is no theme as far as i can tell.<br />

i just got an idea - along with our presets, we should also remix someone elses, not only will this make more presets in the pack, but the over all look of the pack will be very dfferent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, mr_nudge. i like that remixing idea too. But whose preset should we remix? And should everybody deal with the same preset?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that we make a list of a few presets and everybody picks the one he likes to remix (if we decide to add idea to the pack).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm not really keen on the remixing idea to be honest, unless everyone does at least one original preset and at most one remix.<br />
<br />
I think &quot;Tugg Vs PAK&quot; is an okay theme provided you dont interpret it too literally. For example if you make a preset that is in the style of one of ours then comment on why you like the idea. Or do an asthetic preset and comment on how it matches Tuggs philosophy, or two stick men fighting... etc.. some crap along those lines. Not just 'dur I remixeded this preset'.<br />
<br />
Either that or lets just not have a theme and just make presets however the hell you like.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I'm feeling a bit tired and self-contradictory at the moment so interpret this post vaguely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The Pak vs Tugg thing was a joke to begin with, so let's drop it if we're searching for a real theme.<br />
I agree with Tuggummi on that :D<br />
<br />
How about everybody releases &gt;one&lt; original in your own style, I make them public on the board only and we remix those again? It seems the logical thing to do after the way this discussion is going now.. I'm only concerned that there will be presets that will be remixed 5 times and others that aren't remixed at all. <br />
How about it if I (randomly) spread those presets under us all? I'll PM you with the artist/preset to remix.<br />
That'll give us some interesting combinations...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, the theme is not really decided but i think its a really good preset for it if it will be chosen :)<br />

btw if you uncheck the enabled box in the effect list you gain like 8 fps cause the code override with &quot;enabled&quot; works only then :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">odd.. i turned it on to change the blend mode of the picture. the image didn't update so i assumed the code was still working. it didn't update until i saved and loaded the preset. thanks for pointing that out. the flak is really crappy so i'm going to redo it a bit. the on beat code makes it look crappy when the time slows down.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The preset should be included on the grounds of there probably won't be any other 'tech' presets in the pack except for Pak's. Besides that it pwns!</div></div><hr />

@WotL:<br />
i hope the deadline for sending in the presets will stay as it is, right? If so, will there be another closing date for the remixes?  <br />
deadline stays the same. after that date  I will spread the presets.<br />
 IF SOMEONE ISN'T IN TIME HE CAN'T PARTICIPATE<br />
So don't wait until that date please.. thankies<br />

<br />
J are you sure you want to go spreading your APE around in its beta stage? After all when (if) you finish it people will have to overwrite the old one and for simple folk it might all get a bit confusing :confused: <br />
<br />
for whomever is putting the pack together at the end... I think its important to have a naming convention, I really hate packs that are a mish-mash of titles. For example:<br />
<br />
WFCO - 01 - Intro<br />
WFCO - 02 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt;<br />
WFCO - 03 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt;<br />
WFCO - 04 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt;<br />
WFCO - 05 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt;<br />
...<br />
WFCO - 10 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt; (&lt;remix name&gt; by &lt;remixer&gt;)<br />
WFCO - 11 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt; (&lt;remix name&gt; by &lt;remixer&gt;)<br />
WFCO - 12 - &lt;preset author&gt; - &lt;preset name&gt; (&lt;remix name&gt; by &lt;remixer&gt;)<br />
...<br />
<br />
something like that</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's a good idea, pak! i agree with this suggestion. There are so many packs that don't start with the intro cause the presets aren't numbered or sorted in any way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, I thought wrong.. you wanted to do the intro, not building installer+stuff.. *hits self in forehead*<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Cool. I can make the installer check the APE version, and it will be final 1.0 by then anyway<br />
<br />
PimpBot can check version resources so I'm guessing yathosho will add it to PimpBot too... it shouldn't be anymore of a problem than the multiple versions of color map for example</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to, just make a few presets and send them to wotl; if not our remix-idea will be a bit problematic, cause wotl will forward our presets to a randomly picked person, who will remix them. So we (or at least wotl) has to definitively know it. However you shlould ask wotl how short in time you can participate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The matter that concerns me most is if you're capable of remixing.. this is what we'll do..<br />
<br />
I'll give you a fair chance:<br />
<br />
I have hundreds of old presets that I really don't care about anymore.<br />
I'll give you two of such presets.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see what you'd do to them before I let you in.<br />
please remix them a bit, but don't start building an insanely big preset out of it as I don't want to ask too much of your time.. it's only an example and won't be in the pack (unless the presets are breathtaking).<br />
<br />
Please mail me the remixes when you're done.<br />
<br />
PS: I couldn't find your emailaddress so I'll post them here.. <br />
PS2: NOTE: these are not the presets I'm submitting to the pack!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The test was created for Matt because with him I haven't seen the quality that would qualify him as someone that anyone would want for a remixer.<br />
But do you ( = ^..^/PAK-9)  think it's better that everyone takes that test? We don't have that much time left you know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th February 2005, 23:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">no, i don't think that it's suitable to let everyone take this test.<br />
<br />
1) as you said it's not much time left, so you won't reach everyone in time.<br />
<br />
2) and i don't have the impression that the overall quality of the presets will be bad, there are some good artists participating.<br />
<br />
3) if someones remixes are really bad we don't have to admit them into the pack. you could publish the content of the pack when all remixes are done, so that we could finnish it in common agreement...<br />
<br />
just my ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
which of the five?<br />
<br />
From yours I liked retrolines best, but the low framerate hurts me.. around 17 while the original swings around the fifties..<br />
The other remixes were really hurting my eyes..<br />
by the way there is a lot of idle stuff in the last two<br />
<br />
I what I especially like in ^..^'s mix are the colors, but those hard blue lines are just a tad too strong IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, i know what you mean: when the particles move out of the screen it gets too blue. As i said it's just a quick overworked remix...<br />
Feel free to adjust the color maps yourself ;)<br />

No. You knew this deadline weeks ago. Besides, you don't need a whole month to create a single preset.<br />
And the idea was original presets to start with. Someone else will remix your presets. not your remixes of my originals. Just get busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th February 2005, 11:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">so what do you think wotl, are two weeks (+1 of it's needed) OK or too long-winded for the remixes?<br />
<br />
Another thing i wanted to ask: does it matter if someone doesn't remix all presets he gets assigned? I mean if you have presets that are too code heavy/complicated like some of unconed's ones, (i know he doesn't particpate, but you know what i mean) or if they are just too plain (empty) it could be a problem. I hope you understand what im asking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th February 2005, 12:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">At least do one remix. (btw not all people have submitted two pieces)<br />
<br />
Remixing is always possible. If it's too advanced, you could do a style-remix or something else..<br />
An empty preset is ideal for remixing.. at least then you're not bound to what the other artist did.. just finish it to your likings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th February 2005, 12:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I see!! Well you have to tell me! I need &quot;information&quot;*... ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, perhaps i have misunderstood the idea of remixing, i thought you have to keep the basic render/trans effects and are only free in the styling, which limits your possibilities. But when i can add what i want, and it's still a remix, it shouldn't be a big problem.<br />
Let's see what you have up your sleeve...</div></div><hr />

Please mail me the remixes within the next three weeks: deadline: March 20th.<br />

btw how many presets did you distribute altogether? Or how big will the pack roughly become, assuming that every preset gets remixed?</div></div><hr />

so 30 presets in total if everything will be remixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">when all remixes are done, and jheriko made the installer.<br />
If i remember correctly the remix-deadline is 20th of march, so you have to ask jheriko how long it takes him to make the installer. Assuming that he won't need more than a week or so for it the pack is probably going to be released somewhat around end of march / begin of april. (Just my calculations)</div></div><hr />

It doesn't really matter what windows version the user has, because it will still be able to detect winamp and the installation folder. (and if it doesn't work for you, then it doesn't even need to work for you, because clearly your not worthy enough)</div></div><hr />

Uncustomizable (without additional programs or hacks)<br />
closed source :( <br />
Unstable<br />
inefficient ( eg: Using windowblinds is less CPU heavy than the normal XP theme, if you turn off the xp style manager in the regestry&quot;<br />

<div class="posttext">i guess discussing about win or linux could be just as senseless as a discussion about whether to use nvidia or ati gpu's or like intel vs. amd or discussing about belifes or... :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree that ^..^ needs a bit of a slap for calling windows stable and 'best'.<br />
<br />
The question is how many other O/S's have you actually used on a regular basis and in how many contexts?</div></div><hr />

...and most stylish operating system. Seriously!  <br />

Honestly, did you really think that ^this is my opinion?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Let's see that would be... sarcasm of the sarcasm of the sarcasm of the sarcasm of the original sarcastic post.<br />
<br />
That's nothing yet. Wait till he slaps out a quadruple ironical post with a triple sarcastic content, then worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th March 2005, 13:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, its to compensate that i can't really double/triple/etc...-post. So i'm trying this!<br />
<br />
No, joking apart, was it really not obvious that this quoted post was ironic?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not really, at least two people though you were serious. You need to add a little ¬ if your not sure people will understand your being sarcastic (and being sarcastic != irony)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it's easy to pick a sarcastic tone of voice, but not that easy to pick out a sarcastic tone of text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th March 2005, 10:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, that's the problem. Perhaps there should be an &quot;sarcasm-ahead&quot; or a &quot;attention-the-following-words-contain-ironic-elements&quot; smiley. Then it would be much easier (at least for me).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, because that would be REALLY useful*<br />
<br />

*sarcasm intended<br />

yeah, you seem to be just as clever as you look ( ***349; )<br />
<br />
( ***349; ) = &quot;post could contain sarcasm&quot;-character;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yea, but those tags are a bit too striking. It thought of a more discreet notice. Not all people need such thick glasses, or do you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you people all have too much free time.<br />
<br />
Pretty much 90% of what I say is either sarcastic or witty in some way, I dont have time to write little tags or characters to indicate it.</div></div><hr />
