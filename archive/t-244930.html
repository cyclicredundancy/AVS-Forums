      Like many of the good presets, this one is an accident :)<br />
      I was just messing up with a sphere dm i had made and the viola!<br />
      Lots of bright colours, simple and elegant, i think.<br />
      Only problem is that it is not dynamic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice, but why the bitmap? Sure you could generate that kind of background within AVS itself :up:<br />
      <br />
      Also maybe add some sort of fadein-fadeout effect to the position on-beat changing?<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise i really like the style here, good work on the designing department.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tuggummi is right, you could've had a better background with avs and not a bitmap.<br />
      <br />
      Except that everything is cool.:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think using a bitmap would be faster than 3-4 ssc, movement combos. I still have my old pc (if anyone remembers), so i am a simplicity addict :). And if i used patterns for the texture then it would again ruin the simplicity :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Err, you don't know about codable effect lists? Check em out, you can code effect lists now! It's way cool :D<br />
      You can just render the background for the first X frames and then store it to a buffer from which the dm will read it out. I'd say rendering it in a effect list is even faster than using a picture + you get all sort of neat things along with it, like randomness. A picture will always stay the same, but with a still background in AVS you can always render it differently with randomness or even code a few different modes for it manually :up:</p>
