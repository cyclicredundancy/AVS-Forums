      <p class="post-content"><strong>Overlay mode wont work for me.</strong><br />
      Hi I recently got a used computer and I formated the drive and reinstalled Win98SE.<br />
      I have winamp 2.81 (I cant get the new winamp to install the encoding thing so it cant play MP3's)<br />
      Overlay mode just wont work... could it be my video driver?<br />
      Its a "rage 128 4x" on a default monitor.<br />
      AVS version is 2.5.1<br />
      <br />
      any questions lemme know please</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know there are some graphics cards that give some issues indeed, but sometimes there are work-arounds. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank">Search</a> the forums for older threads, you might find yourself lucky.<br />
      <br />
      However, I'd still recommend you use at least winamp5.01, since avs was updated there. Winamp2 and 5 classic are almost fully compatible. Try if you can copy the 'encoding thing' to the same place in winamp5. Also, Winamp5 is faster and uses less resources.<br />
      If, however, you still prefer winamp2, then get 2.91 (or 2.95(unsupported)) from <a href="http://www.winampheaven.net/" target="_blank">www.winampheaven.net</a><br />
      The lame codec can also be found there, if that's what you meant.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found out the problem...<br />
      It turns out that to fix the encoder problem with the MP3 for the new version of winamp and to fix overlay mode on either version is to get the windows media player upgrade from windows update.<br />
      I dont know why and dont get mad if this dosnt help you fix your AVS problem. but its a start.</p>
