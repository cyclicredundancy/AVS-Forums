      well... i was browsing the web when all of a sudden i stumbled opoun winamp.com. here i entered the plugins section and saw avs presets and fianlly i saw a very kind comment coming from a very cool guy.<br />
      so i think i'm back in bussiness. now i know not all of you really care, but this is for the ones that liked my work.<br />
      all i have to do now is install windows - i've been a linux user for some time now - and remember basic analytical geometry. :D<br />
      can't wait to publish some stuff. expect from me soon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well... there were some things happening and i needed to stop everything for a while, so i could concentrate only on that. but now everything's calmed down so i can get back to avs. the problem is i cant' remember a thing - not that i was good with coding back then, so i guess i should start reading the tutorials and get back on the horse. :D</p>
