<div class="posttext">Inspired by UnConeD (again)(Ok so i copied the idea... i'll just call it a tribute and everything will be aaalright :D), &quot;inspired by&quot; UnConeDs elevation remix of shock value thingy, i still have a lot of work on the DM i think but here's what i have so far...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like that DM, it get's pretty close to the same effect as UnConed's, (except with no turning), but the thing is, I can't really understand how yours gets were it got! The camera does need a little bit more reactive movement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know that game 12309238423.<br />
<br />
Good preset, but it does need to move a little more, as well as turn into the side paths.  Buildings of different heights would be cool, but I don't think that that would be easy to implement in a DM.</div></div><hr />

raz: reminds me of wolfenavstein3d without the turns...nice tho.  the camera movement (both position and angle) seems a bit stiff and unnatural...dunno why tho</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought the exact same thing Atero when i first starting playing with the movement, seems a bit... wrong but i think i got used to it eventually. I'll eventaully get it to turn in different directions but first i've got to entirely decode zero g maze 3... so it's going to have to just move forward for now. I'll put a little work in later but i've just got up now and i'm going out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, the reason it looks like unconed's wolfenstein preset is because he made the remix of shock value's preset using his wolfenstein code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah but it doesn't explain why *this* looks like it ;).<br />
<br />
Lacks a 'neon' feel though and I think the wrapping is quite obvious on the side. Perhaps you could try reducing the size of your squares on the texture, and increasing the texture size on the 3D objects.<br />
<br />
Oh and avoid non-power-of-two coefficients in convolution, you can almost always come up with a faster kernel/divisor combo that looks nearly the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok update, i made it neon-ish like and it looks purty now, also i made the wrap less obvious and optimised that horrible mess that made the basic shape. Oh yeah quick question does a replace replace EL suck fps?<br />
<br />
UnConeD, do you know how i could shorten the distance between the intersections, i coded the basic premise for this monster of a DM a long time a go and maybe its just my messy code but i can't seem to figure out how, help muchas appreciated...<br />
<br />
and now to bed......</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The distance-based colors are really weird looking.  Don't like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I like how you changed the texture, but the Camera seems to follow the same general path, I think that needs some more work, like maybe having it move up and down, or maybe reverse around and be moving backwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh yeah quick question does a replace replace EL suck fps?<br />
<br />
Each effect list has a separate buffer. Given the fact that AVS is not very optimized, a Replace/Replace FxList probably copies the image back and forth at the beginning resp. end, even though this is unnecessary.<br />
However, unless it is triggered onbeat, you can just remove the Replace/Replace FxList and put all the components outside (be careful of the dragging-order bug though).<br />
<br />
Btw Raz, could you put your nick in front of your presets? It's a common practice and makes it easier both now ('Raz made a preset... load -&gt; Raz*') and later on ('I know someone made something similar a while ago...hmmm...who was it? I have this Neon Wilderness sitting here').<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of the constant wobbling and the preset is weird because the lights get dark up close.<br />
<br />
As far as distance shortening goes, you should jump the camera at the position as close as possible to the intersection without it looking odd. For the beginning of the jump, pick the position where the camera passes through the clipped out plane:<br />
<br />
  |   |<br />
__| ^ |__  _ _ _ _ when the camera passes through here,<br />
    .              move it back 'down'.<br />
__  .  __<br />
  | . |<br />
  | . |<br />
<br />
<br />
You can do it slightly lower if you want (depending on the projection angle and rotation around the camera's velocity vector).<br />
<br />
Oh and you still need to get rid of that bad convokernel. Change the divisor from 3 to 4 and watch the FPS soar. To keep the overbright effect, change the center pixel's coefficient to 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
More optimizations (DM):<br />
z1=if(below((ax+xsx)/xxx,0),-10,((ax+xsx)/xxx));<br />
-&gt; Most of the time this is a no-no. Put the subexpression in a variable and change to:<br />
z1=if(below(var,0),-1,var);<br />
<br />
y=y*(h/w);<br />
-&gt; Put h/w into a variable once per frame rather than calculating it per point. You'll be replacing 32x32=1024 divisions perframe by 1.<br />
<br />
xxx=xax*cy-(yay*sx+1*cx)*sy;<br />
zzz=xax*sy+(yay*sx+1*cx)*cy;<br />
-&gt; I know you're probably still experimenting with the viewing angle, but by removing the '1*' you'll get rid of 2048 multiplications perframe.</div></div><hr />
