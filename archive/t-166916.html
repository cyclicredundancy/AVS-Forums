		Nothing related to AVS, but this is the only place I know lots of people, so I posted it here.<br />
This is a program I developed in the last month during my spare time(which was of course very less). What you need to do is add bitmaps texture1.bmp, texture2.bmp till texture5.bmp in the World folder. <br />
The program will load the textures and design the world according to the WorldData.txt found in the World folder. Furthur explaination in the text file :)

		This has:<br />
- Nothing to do with AVS<br />
- Nothing to do with sound visualisation<br />
- Nothing to do with interactive, real-time creation of something.<br />
<br />
And it's badly done, awful to install and crashes here (GF2MX).<br />
<br />
Off-topic.

It is awful to install, but I got it to run over here.  It moves really, really fast and bobs up and down like crazy.  And you can walk right through the walls.

		There are much better places to post this which deal with general computer graphics (flipcode.com for example, and the links on flipcode too). I suppose it's just another generic landscape engine?<br />
<br />
I personally think the AVS forums topics should stick to sound visualisation (and indirectly, things like Pimpbot, VJ'ing, projections, ...). Even other visualisation plug-ins can be discussed here (though support questions don't belong IMO, and of course Milkdrop stuff should go in the Milkdrop forums).<br />
<br />
The general rule is of course: use your own judgement.

		I have SIS integrated graphics, and they suck.  I got Enter The Matrix for christmas, and I couldn't get it to run with my lousy graphics.  But this runs fine.  Heres a screenshot.<br />

		I agree with UnConeD.<br />
And posting something irrelevant just because you know a lot of people down here isn't a very good reason, why not go make new friends to the place where they do this stuff more often? :)
