			<strong>MSVCR70.dll</strong><br />
		
		

		Wow. Haven't been here in ages :) How is the old AVS community?<br />
<br />
Im having a problem running AVS in Winamp 3. I get an error message MSVCR70.dll not found. Tried reinstalling. Even installed it on another box and noooo good. It plays the preview of my old presets but won't allow me to ouput in fullscreen clone mode to a projector. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way - I need to run three because alot of my old presets die in WA5 Avs for some reason.

If you'd copy vis_avs.dll from wa3.x to wa5.x, are the presets still messed up?<br />
Also, keep in mind that the AVS version that came with 5.31 and 5.32 is messed up.<br />
get AVS 2.81d <a href="http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/AVS%20Update.exe" target="_blank">here</a>

		Considering that msvcr70.dll is required by the software, and the developer should know this... and the .dll should be included in the installer.<br />
<br />
When testing if I miss this out it is usually the first thing to come up... I think I might go and find the right place to mention this and request that the .dll be installed by the Winamp installer.

		winamp isn't built with the msvc version which makes apps need msvcr70.dll (current winamp builds where necessary use nscrt.dll which is the crt and msvcr71.dll merged together).<br />
<br />
the real issue here is that if it's only to do with the Winamp3 builds of avs then there's little to be done seeing as anything to do with Winamp3 just isn't supported anymore - manually installing the dll would be the only way (as was the case when Winamp3 was shipping though i'm sure all of the Winamp3 stuff was msvc6 compiled so quite where that dependancy is coming from is a bit baffling)<br />
