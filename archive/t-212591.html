<div class="posttext">i've used avs off and on for a couple years and have made some presets that i've liked but i don't really know anything about the advanced features of avs, so i try to find different ways to use the basic tools (usually resulting in crashing winamp :confused: ). anyway, check out these presets i've made in the past couple days and let me know what you think and how i can learn to use avs better for the visual styles i go for...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you seriously intend to make better presets you should quit using only the basic effects. The advanced avs-features (i guess you mean superscope/movement and all other 'codable' effects) are much more versatile. And today you cannot work around some basic coding skills. You can get acquaint to the coding language used in AVS with the help of these tutorials. (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060) <br />
