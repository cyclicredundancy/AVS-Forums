<div class="posttext">I know that there are playlisters for professional presentation of presets during raves, etc. but it would be really nice providing a simple possibility for an avs-artist to order the presets in a pack or presentation using the u and y keys.<br />
<br />
Idea:<br />
<br />
A new misc module that could be added to the flowline of a preset specifying the next (u) and previous (y) preset combined with a reserved preset name like index.avs, startup.avs, etc. which is always jumped on first if navigating to an directory with u/y-key and which is always listed first in the presets listing of an directory.<br />
<br />
If a specified preset or index.avs is not found the u/y key is switching to the next/previous preset as in the past.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you make sure the PiMP or NSIS script includes each preset in the correct order, then they will extract in that order too. I've been using this since Whacko AVS pack :).<br />
To save having to copy each filename into the script, you can number your presets and use wildcards (&quot;01*.avs&quot;, &quot;02*.avs&quot;, ...).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice, this will solve at least the order problem with packs but still I think there should be an easier way - means not two monitors/graphic cards, etc. - to control presets or setup an order/playlist for presentations. So perhaps playlister by goebish could be modified to work with fullscreen mode too and to load playlists by hotkeys...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">He's working on that for the next version.<br />
<br />
Magic X made a program a while ago that would fit the bill, but it doesn't do transitions and isn't as intuitive.</div></div><hr />
