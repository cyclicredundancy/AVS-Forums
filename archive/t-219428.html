<div class="posttext">After updating to Winamp 5.093 I found this strange behaviour<br />
of AVS: if I start playing music and then start up AVS-plugin, most of the visualizations are not working (freeze/blank/etc. visualizations)<br />
<br />
In order to make it work, I have to FIRST load up AVS and thenstart playing music and everything is fine. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions Winamp friends?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ummm this is how AVS works, by playing music, most / some of the presets are beat-responsive and need music to work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think he's asking why you have to open avs and then start the music, rather than starting music and later opening avs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry that I can't be of much help; I'm not quite sure of why this would happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have noticed that I get a 2-second pause between when the AVS shows up and when the scopes start animating. The AVS preset itself is running during this time; it's the osc/spec data that's paused. If I start AVS first, and then immediately start the music, this pause doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Very odd... but it's just a 2-second pause, which isn't really annoying or anything. (I think it happens because the default buffer size for DirectSound output is two seconds. The pause is deliberate, to sync the visualization to the output. That's my theory...)<br />
<br />
This might, however, be a variant of the problem that cinematog is having... or maybe it's something completely different.<br />
<br />
First thing I'd suggest, therefore, is checking the settings of the output plugin. A really large buffer could possibly give the illusion of AVS being frozen or not working correctly (even though it technically is).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">cinematog: I tried to get to the same result you had without 'succes' so far..<br />
<br />
Could you give us more information about the verion you updated from or was it a clean new install?<br />
<br />
I always recommend a clean install (=complete de-installation first, then install instead of update)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you all for your time! I tried with many many buffer settings and several other winamp configurations. This is also clean install after reboot. And I re-installed once again just to make sure. :)<br />
I have ATI Radeon 9700 and only SP1. If I FIRST load up AVS it's indeed working....this is driving me lunatic! If I find a solution Ill report. Keep your insights coming friends!</div></div><hr />
