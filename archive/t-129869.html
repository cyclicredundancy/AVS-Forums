		Well, I know that this has been posted quite a few times, and I have read through the previous posts... I can post the bookmarked links if u want :)  But I really cannot get this to work.  I am trying to sync this SSC with my DM, and it seems to work sometimes, but not always... it fades in and out of workability :)<br />
<br />
I thought that I had what was recommended - running the rotations in reverse order and things like that, but I think that I am just missing something silly... any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch all ^_^

		What is it supposed to be doing exactly?  Are the tunnel and the spring supposed to always be lined up?

		mmmm, really nice, love that pattern. Too bad i can't help with the syncing problem :)<br />
<br />
Though may i suggest you make the spring a bit more thicker &amp; smoother? Maybe use texer for it?
