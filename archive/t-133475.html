      <p class="post-content"><strong>Color BIT Mapper</strong><br />
      Well as i said (see ColorMapper2) i had bee doing some researches and wrote a prog that does 2D Colormapping referring to a picture as map.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, the whole thing is written in crappy Delphi and therefore cant be used as ape (it couldnt be either if it was C-code bacause i used objects). But anyway, the mapping algorithm works, i even added some more channel options.<br />
      <br />
      I'll post the prog and the sources here as soon as i uploaded it to my webspace - already mailed it to unconed, so he may be faster.<br />
      <br />
      I'd say lets work on this and get it running :D</p>

      Just check it out (sorry, a bit slow) and tell me what you think about that. Maybe one of you can gimme a hand in rewriting this in C as an APE.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This slooooooooooooooooooooooooowww. Try not updating the progressbars everytime, that could speed it up.<br />
      <br />
      And well, APEs like this definitely need to be written in MMX :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i had em off in the first place, but then i saw no progress for a long time, and it wasnt really faster. This is only to visualize that here is at least something happening.<br />
      <br />
      The main fault is that i used the cavas of a TImage object, as well as a temporary TBitmap. Those objects havent been designed for fast operations.<br />
      <br />
      But anyway, thats what i wrote in my mail. took you a pretty long time to respond.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Actually I wrote a short blurb about MMX in a mail to shreyas, but considering it didn't help him at all, it's probably badly written.<br />
      Ask him.</p>

      <br />
      and UnconeD, your mail did help me a lot...I could rip of picture II and make Dynamic Clear Screen.<br />
      <br />
      well, seriously,<br />
      I used some parts (for multiply and XOR blend and maximum blend) of picture II for my APE, (is it ok?)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, that reveals the meaning of those mysterious sequences in the picture 2 code.<br />
      <br />
      To smit up, the MMX code is able to split a 32bit RGB val up into its 4 channels and do the same opertaions to all.<br />
      <br />
      Gonna do researches on that.<br />
      <br />
      Is it possible to use 3Dnow and ISSE command sets? Those have been developped later and should contain also usable things.</p>
