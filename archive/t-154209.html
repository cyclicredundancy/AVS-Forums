		Some stuff I just made with Texer II, and I decided I love the damn thing. I only used the default image till now, and it is working lovely. :D<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think, pack worthy or not?

		If you don't have Tuggummi's texer resources, get them. The default image is taken from that actually (with permission of course ;)).<br />
<br />
Btw, you shouldn't use the b variable anymore with the newer Texer 2.<br />
<br />
Very nice presets, though you might want to aspect-ratio correct them (multiply y by w/h, or x by h/w).

		I get Texer resources, and flush all my AVS directories (except my own) all with the coming of wa5 gold. After that I'm going to install packs I like organized. Thanks for the tip :)

		Yep, I decided I liked that one as well, and it's going to come with my new pack. I'm tweaking it as well. I used a minor modified version of your resizing code in the backward circles. I hope that's okay with you. (of course you're fully credited for it.) I also modified the movement code of the tentacles by adding a t variable to it, so it moves more smoothly.<br />
<br />
<pre><code><br />
x1=i*1.1;<br />
y1=sin(x1*cos(yt+t)*4.5);<br />
<br />
<b>In frame:</b><br />
t=t-0.075<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
Thanks for the resizing code, I couldn't work it out myself correctly.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, I also added the thingie-correction by adding y=w/h in the circles.

		hmm, try this one:<br />
t=t-getspec(.5,0,0)*.1<br />
(why minus?)<br />
You could calculate sin&amp;cos in frame as well (won't make much difference with n=10 though).<br />
And yes, you can use whatever you find useful.

		Thank you :). (oh and btw, I just happen to like minus ;))
