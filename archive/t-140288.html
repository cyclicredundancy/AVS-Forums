<div class="posttext">Not a bad pack. The problem with remix packs though is that sometimes you're limited by what to original preset was like. There were several in there that I didn't like the originals of, and I don't like the mixes much either.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2 favourite are:<br />
<br />
Tribute to Laki - Dreamz on LSD mix<br />
Pistaccio2<br />
<br />
A couple of problems:<br />
<br />
Phaze mix of Liquid paradise is missing a texer pic.<br />
No option to install to WA3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sweet pack with sweet presets.I especially liked...my presets :P Jaheck : i hope you tried to put a whacko bmp to see how that preset really looks,its great imho :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I tried it, but I shouldn't have to. I dunno if I'm the only one who has this problem with the texer, but I'm the only one who really seems to complain about it. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">IMO, it looks best with whacko6-05 and -06 bmp's. I  didn't put a pic in there mostly because I didn't know what pic I was supposed to put in there (afaik there's no such thing as a texer.bmp in that pack), and the remix looked great even without the pic :). There's a separate installer for wa3. I submitted the other version of the pack in the wa3 components and it still hasn't been reviewed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">use whacko 06.Oh and...i installed the pack and my preset was working fine.WITH THE BMP. :)</div></div><hr />
