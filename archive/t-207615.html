<div class="posttext">Please forgive me if this is adressed somewhere else, I searched and couldn't find it. <br />
<br />
If I am using a preset with &quot;experimental&quot; aspects to it to where you can switch from &quot;auto&quot; to &quot;mouse 1&quot; to &quot;mouse 2&quot; and like that (a prime example is S_KuPeRS '25 - recovering from fate (the way things change) from the lp8 pack) if I am in fullscreen and I click on the screen to change which setting I am using, it goes back to windowed mode, so basically I cant figure out how to switch from 'auto' to 'mouse 1' without going back and forth between fullscreen and windowed. Is there any way to fix this? <br />
<br />
I fear I have made this question incredibly more complex than it needs to be; I was trying to be complete in my description. I hope someone can decipher it!:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">if you leftclick in fullscreen, it will go back to windowed. if you rightclick in windowed, it opens the popup menu. so you need both. make a code that supports both keys! (i could tell you the code but its so easy to do that i wont :p)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Just use something like: click=bor(rightclick,leftclick)<br />
<br />
Left click works in windowed<br />
Right click works in fullscreen<br />
<br />
Easy as $pi^e.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I usually dont bother supporting mouse in fullscreen, because if people fullscreen the preset they probably want to watch it not play with it.<br />
<br />
You can 'guess' if a preset is in fullscreen by using the width or height, then you can modify it so that mouse control stuff doesnt appear or it is different somehow.<br />
<br />
fullscrn=above(w,639); //1 if the AVS window is 640 wide or more</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't really understand what you are talking about. Enter a code where? It may be easy as $pi^e for you AVS experts, but I'm just one of the guys who likes to watch (and play with it too, PAK 9) But since I know you guys are like famous and stuff, (Tuggummi, I am a fan) I will assume it may be figured out easily. somewhere in the config menu, maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2005, 20:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Aah, so you're not making a preset yourself? Okay.<br />
<br />
We were talking about how you implent that support for your own presets (supposedly you would be making one), but since you aren't this whole thread became pretty pointless just about now :)<br />
<br />
The thing is that &quot;support&quot; for such interactive features in fullscreen need to be coded in to the preset itself. There is no option on the preferences or the likes to magically turn it on, because the author of the preset has to make it so that you can use the features on fullscreen too. So it's up to the preset whether or not the features will work on fullscreen, but i still urge you to try out the rightclick on fullscreen, atleast all of my presets (the very few) which have interactive features should have rightclick support.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually, rightclick doesn't do anything when I click in fullscreen, but I will play around with it. I never thought about the fact that I didn't make it clear if I was making a preset. Duh. (I plan on it someday, but I don't have any math knowledge except basic algebra) Thank you thank you for the patience and time taken to answer this board. You rock. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol, You are correct, PAK-9, I am indeed a noob. I apologize for the unclearness. By the way, I am just now realizing that you are all famous. PAK-9 and jheriko, of course I've seen your work and definetly liked what I saw. (Warrior and hboy I am also familiar with) Maybe that doesn't mean much coming from a noob, but to paraphrase; &quot;I may not know how to make a preset, but I know what I like.&quot;) I hope someday I will be asking you guys a legitimate technical AVS question. You have already taught me something (I had no idea that the interactive stuff could be coded into the preset.) You all rock. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just while this thread is still around...what specific mathematics skills would get me on the road to making a good preset? Or do you pretty much have a complete grasp of geometry, trig, and calculus (not to mention algebra)? I suppose I am looking for a &quot;shortcut&quot; to a good preset if it's possible.  *looks hopeful* :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know nothing about those, to me they sound like french cousines. Mmm... *drools*<br />
<br />
I learned things over the years, but i never have learned anything about maths nor will i ever do. But im sure all the other people will tell you to learn this &amp; that in order to AVS properly :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th February 2005, 14:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I personally wouldnt say you need a lot of maths to make AVS, it helps, but its not necessary. You can sit and read maths textbooks for hours but you'll find hardly any of it can be directly applied to making AVS presets. Its better to think of what you want to do, then think about what maths (if any) is required to solve that problem.<br />
<br />
In my opinion (and I stress this is just my opinion) programming prowess is much more important in AVS than maths, if you have a good grasp of the language you can implement what you see in your mind much more easily. Search the forums for tutorials, if you want it my programming guide is here:<br />

<div class="posttext">Thanks, guys. I always figured math was responsible for all presets. If it's programming, heck; I can learn as much as the next guy. (Honestly: both you and Tuggummi have made some of the BEST presets I've ever seen, I can't believe you don't know any super-math to do them! lol) Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lol, well I am long out of school, so I have at least a rudimentry grasp of algebra. And I have worked somewhat with programming lang. before, so along with a tutorial or 2 or 3, I should be able to figure something out.</div></div><hr />
