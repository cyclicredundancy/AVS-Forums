      i'm pretty new in the bussiness, so i don't know how many of you heard of me. but i'm working a new pack (my 5th instalment, on which i'll have a collaboration with a dear friend of mine) and i was curious what you people thought about this preset.<br />
      be gentle :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">Its nice and flowy, with some good colours.<br />
      I think its a bit to white as it is.<br />
      <br />
      I justed had a play with it and if you put an invert before the fourth texerII and after the last one it looks better imo.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ooh i like it. i think some of the colour maps are a bit off. i like the first and 6th the best. other than that it's great, maybe just strengthen the darker parts as well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hrmm well it should of cut some holes out the mass of white making it more colourful. heh, maybe being tired and trash metal doesn't help commenting on presets :P<br />
      <br />
      Any way, looking at this morning I'd still say its a bit white, but i'd be happy to look at it. It reminds me of zamuz's work.</p>
