<div class="posttext">I think you should make the nuclear preset more responsive. Maybe adding getosc pumpbeat to the base superscope would do the trick..<br />
<br />
I don't know about the other preset. The dynamov looks cool, but I really don't like the colors....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nuclear preset is awesome, I think Blazer's right about it, though.  Zip utility is fucked (again), so I can't attach the edited file.<br />
I REALLY don't like the colors or the scopes on the other preset, but the DM is fucking awesome.  I don't know what to do with it, though.  Sorry :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well in hydrodream i had an idea that the scopes would rotate in the center in their current form, but i failed to do that :( Otherwise i think it's a great preset, but the colors need a little brightness or some cool effect. I loved the framerate in it, hope it stays fast ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, i was determined to do something with both so i did,</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cool. I especially like the black and white nuclear one. The sunshine preset is very cool too, the colours are nice (better than the multi-coloured or monochrome mush that is growing more and more common) and the DM is nifty. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Like the nuclear remixes, still don't like that tic-tac-toe thing.  It's still the colors - it's too gray, and very uniform.  That final DM doesn't do much for it either.  Try randomizing the hue on-beat for each scope seperately....</div></div><hr />
