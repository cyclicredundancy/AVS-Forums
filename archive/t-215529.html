      I've used AVS studio to VJ a couple of times and I like it. Though it is necessary to have some backup in case winamp crashes. Unfortunately AVI players are not the most reliable elements in presets. At least not when one wants to change the videos a lot.<br />
      <br />
      I haven't really seen people using video in their presets here and there is kind of a coding craze going on, no bad thing of course. But computers are getting better and avi can easily be used in presets nowadays.<br />
      <br />
      Tim Redfern is an example of someone using AVS with video. Check out his <a href="http://eclectronics.org/" target="_blank">site</a>.<br />
      <br />
      I would really like to explore these possibilities with AVS.<br />
      So I made a fader, to fade from one video, preset or whatever to another. Of course it uses Wittens <a href="http://www.acko.net/art/avs/" target="_blank">vjcontrol</a> ;)<br />
      <br />
      Wonder what you think of it.<br />
      Any one else made any nice VJ stuff?</p>

      <p class="post-content">though i havn't used many videos in avs, i can imagine that the stability suffers more, when the videos (codecs, resolution) differ a lot from each other. however, have you tried using the <a href="http://goebish.free.fr/vfx/" target="_blank">Vfx AVI Player</a> APE?<br />
      <br />
      btw, there was a preset with video posted at vjforums recently.</p>
