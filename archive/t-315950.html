      <p class="post-content"><strong>Searching AVS File</strong><br />
      Hello Friends,<br />
      i search after a very very good avs file.<br />
      It was in the past. I had a good winamp version where I start every party the AVS Visualation.<br />
      There was a good Song in the year 2000. Orange Blue - She's got that light. Somebody will remember :-)<br />
      <br />
      At this good song a avs file was on my screen.<br />
      It was a black backround and four red rings. This four rings play after the beat from the song. At the backround behind the rings was blue and yellow points. It was fantastic.<br />
      <br />
      I searched after this avs since four years. I couldn't find it.<br />
      I think the name from the avs was "Wormhole" or something special.<br />
      <br />
      I would be very happy if somebody find this good avs.<br />
      <br />
      Please help me to find the avs<br />
      <br />
      Your Ben<br />
      <br />
      add:<br />
      I searched the site from Steven Wittens - Acko.net<br />
      At his site are a lot of avs files. I install all files in my winmap. But there wasn't the avs file.<br />
      <br />
      The AVS file have to be in one of an old Winamp version.<br />
      At the time i installed winamp i downloaded it from winamp.com<br />
      It was the AVS Visualization. I know this. Not another Visualization.</p>

      <p class="post-content">not the most uncreative name on my computer - i had three with that name on my computer, but none matched your description. there are probably a thousand more out there using that name. however, if you felt unconed's presets were a good lead , you might also want to try some <a href="http://archive.visbot.net/el-vis/" target="_blank">el-vis</a> presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello warrior of the king.<br />
      I install the avs files. But there isn't the search one.<br />
      There is one avs "justin - fireworks kaliadascope mk 2" This colours are like the search one. But there was a black hole in the backround and three or four rings with going with the beat of the music. The rings was red...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Yathosho,<br />
      <br />
      yeah thank you I want to try the files. But I think that it have to be a "justin" avs file.<br />
      <br />
      Like the "justin - fireworks kaliadascope mk 2" file.<br />
      <br />
      The name of my avs file for example "justin - wormholes"<br />
      <br />
      I know that there are many wormhole files. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Friends,<br />
      i searched many avs files. I know that it must be a "justin file"<br />
      The colours by "justin avs files" are the same as in my "wormhole avs" :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Please help me to find the avs file.<br />
      <br />
      I added a avs file with the colours of my searched file.<br />
      <br />
      I know that the visualation begins with three or four rings in red. Backround was black. The colours are the same as in the "justin - say trip.avs file"<br />
      <br />
      The file is packed with win rar.<br />
      <br />
      I look after winamp versions. The new winamp version 2.95 hadn't old avs files. The winamp version who was older had more avs files. For exmaple the "justin - say trip.avs" wasn't in the new 2.95 version but in the older one.<br />
      <br />
      Have somebody older winamp versions ? I want to install all the versions, to save the avs files.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello Warrior of the Light,<br />
      <br />
      i love you my friend :D ... The old avs files.<br />
      <br />
      I know some old avs files because i installed old winamp versions to search after the avs files.<br />
      <br />
      But i put your old avs files in my winmap version 2.91c.<br />
      <br />
      I looked the first avs file : tom - pretty two.avs<br />
      <br />
      Woooowww........... It was fantastic. I think that this file is the right ONE!!!<br />
      <br />
      The old avs file : tom - pretty two.avs is very fast because i have a very fast cpu... At 2000 i had a 800 Mhz Cpu with an older videocard with only 32 MB ;)<br />
      <br />
      The colours of the avs file are the right one MY FRIEND! :D<br />
      <br />
      Warrior of the Light ... you are the "Forum King" ...<br />
      <br />
      I think that the avs file was changed. Do you know if there is a newer version of the tom - pretty two.avs file ?<br />
      <br />
      I had one file named "justin - say trip" and there was an older version and a newer one. Could it be that there is another one for tom - pretty two? :up: :up: :up:<br />

      <p class="post-content">(Forum King only means that I have more than 2000 posts on these forums)<br />
      <br />
      There isn't an other version of 'pretty two'.<br />
      Why don't you open the editor and try to make it the way you like? There is a list of tutorials here, and also quite some german-speaking artists around.</p>
