<div class="posttext">Hi:<br />
<br />
I am looking for a winamp (or WinMediaPlayer) VIZ developer/artist for hire:<br />
 <br />
- I need a developer for a stand-alone (kiosk) application that will create visualizations on-the-fly for DJ's in a nightclub using WinAmp and a viz plug-in...so no pc client install concerns...The other good thing is that they will play only on 3 identical PC's.<br />
 <br />
- There should be several phases/modes of the animations.<br />
 <br />
- I will provide several EPS (vector) images including a logo and maybe a speaker or other simple symbols.  These should be integrated in design of solution.<br />
 <br />
2 examples I like:<br />
 <br />
I like all of these presets:  http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=118676<br />
 <br />
and I really like the character/environ: http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=120241 (caution-spyware)<br />
<br />
If you are interested in making a cool app for cash, please email: mike@clearcontent.net</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok easy Atero.<br />
<br />
Admittedly not the entirely correct place to post but it does contain a AVS pack link and does seem a little relevant.<br />
<br />
No-one is sending them anywhere.<br />
<br />
Cross-posting I not like but as the AVS community and others (and vice versa) don't mix generally to talk about vises (including in this case AVS) you will be wanting to post in more thanb one forum.<br />
<br />
Who knows maybw he will want a AVS preset contrest with a cash prize and someone here might be interested.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and he forgot to say please, and he forgot to say what payment is, and he forgot that all of us live around the entire world, so we can't possible just come to a fucking stand-alone place to make vis'es for him. For the same money it's some old dirty man hoping to kidnap someone for sick anal sex etc. etc. etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Right closing this topic nothing but abuse. Anyway the guy rang me up and we had a chat about this if might even be able to have a sponsered AVS contest for you people if things work out. It was obvious from his post that he did not know what he wanted not everyone has a masters degree in winamp visualizations you know.<br />
<br />
Anyway I have to geta demo ready for him.</div></div><hr />
