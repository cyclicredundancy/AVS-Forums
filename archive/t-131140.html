		First of all, you ask everyone not to flame you, but then you go and DOUBLE POST THE WHOLE DAMN THREAD!!?!?!<br />

if you want a collection and then want to publish it, then its of no use, because everyone has it, atleast those who have downloaded AVS packs! :D

		Like Raz said, it's all about personal taste. Ofcourse there are some artists that are technically better at making superscopes, but there also a lot of presets with simple 3d sscs that are very nice.

		Can everyone just stopped complaining!?!?!<br />
the quistion is really not that subjective<br />
Sure, you may say that you have personal opinions, but no doubt if wee all participate, our opinions will be pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
The dude asked a screwed up question, sure, ill give you that. But hey, its still a question. i answered it. If everyone on this board stopped beign so friken arogant, we might learn to cohese, and pool our knowledge. <br />
Together, we could produce the greatest avs art the world has seen..<br />
IF WE COULD JUST LEARN TOLERANCE!!<br />
IF ONLY WE COULD JUST WORK TOGETHER!<br />
<br />
OH GOD WHY!!!!!?!????????<br />

		Fine that's it, if nobody wants to help fine! i just wanted some best 3d presets cause i dont have them:( and as far as post pumping is concerned the the double thread was just a mistake. i dont want to blame anyone but when anyone else post a thread like &quot;who is the best technically live artist?&quot; everybody seem to like it and when I post a thread best of 3d presets, everyone says i'm stupid. and i dont want to publish them in a pack cause i know that everyone has them. <br />
I heard a lot about UnconeD's wolfAVStein preset but i did'nt have so i asked you'll to post it here so that i could have it, but you all are not willing that's Ok.I think everybody is still unhappy with me because of that atero ban , if that's the problem it OK i will never come back again.

		Well, if you dont have a preset, then you can just search the forums, you well get most of the things here,<br />
goto AVS forums, and search WolfAVSstien 3d thats all,<br />
or search UnconeD, you will find all the posts by UnconeD, simple :)

My favorite 3D preset *not* by me would be 'Your First Victory' by fsk from pd3. Easily the coolest thing I have seen someone else make with superscopes.<br />

		I still say it's up to personal taste, and i'm not going to apologise every time a noob threatens to leave us forever. If you're going to leave just go. Don't make a huge scene out of it. Stop acting like a child to get attention and go and search for wolfenAVStein yourself. We're not here just for you.

		that on the run preset is prety awesome!!<br />
pity it barely moves to the music.. <br />
try puting in some on beat camera movements.. <br />
you could also make the movement cycles speed up based on spec data on beat... <br />
<br />
Heres another cool 3d idea in the making:<br />
ive been working on that reflection preset again..this is very incomplete.<br />
<br />
The ripple idea and the camera movement path is from 'the source II'

		That 'On The Run' is the preview release from da, the actual 'On The Run' will be much different and much more reactive. You'll have to wait for Pack VIII to see it though. There is also another version in a minipack that I've made which will be released whenever it gets reviewed here at winamp.com with a reactive background.<br />
<br />
Your mirror preset requires some aspect ratio correction btw. Reflections have been done before by the way. Theres reflectocube by unconed, my pack vi intro and my bluespectrum remix from i wanna be frak nagel. There are probably more out there too, expecially since the way that I've done reflections is painfully easy and fast and unconed's method is a simple extension of the raytracing method(but slow imo).

		Why this thread is easily flameable? Well maybe it's because the non-technical artists (such as myself), just feel insulted by this.<br />
<br />
Personally i feel like im going to be obsolete in the next 1-2 years if avs keeps going more technical.

		The Beast singer in the World.....<br />
<br />
I agree with nixa,<br />
<br />
Its....<br />
<br />
Tarja From Nightwish....<br />
<br />
:cool:  ;)  :D <br />
<br />
And the Best 3d Preset....<br />
<br />
circuit City by UnConeD<br />
<br />
or Desitnation Unknown 2 by Duo. ( if for no other reason than it just looks good ).<br />
<br />
And plus AVS has made my 2d Oldskool ASV obsolete,<br />
<br />
!! It makes me wonder how many more years people are gonna pump into AVS before they realise its just a plugin for a music program on a computer, kinda insignificant in the grand scheme aye? !!
