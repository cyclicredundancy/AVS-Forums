      <p class="post-content">That scope is duo's. I theink the preset was called 'abstract existence' and it was in envision II. I think it may be one of the presets that came with winamp 3 too... but since my winamp 3 broke and I deleted it I can't check, that and I can't be bothered to download it again.<br />

      Personally I would use a max blend with 5 pixel line width to make that one look more solid. It think it would look a bit better with some fake depth fogging too.</p>
