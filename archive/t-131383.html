      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Performs Disappearing Act</strong><br />
      Greetings Citizens:<br />
      <br />
      Just started using AVS last night and within hours I messed it up. Oops. Have read about similar issues confronting disappearing AVS, but their solutions, getting into the editor, has proven impossibly difficult. Since the AVS screen reveals itself for a moment, I have tried to move "Thinger" right underneeth the momentary flicker of AVS screen, right next to where "Open Editor" flashes itself, in an attempt to click on. "Open editor" has proved much too swift for my shenanagans, and so to yee I ask for help. many thanks . . . armen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can you explain what is happening a little clearer.<br />
      <br />
      You click on the AVS button in the thinger, and then what happens?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I click the AVS icon in the Thinger, and the AVS window momentarily opens, and then disappears. So I get a split second view of a blank AVS window, with no graphics in the background. Thus, I am unable to click on "Open Editor" and access the settings within the editor. From my reading similar problems encountered by other users it seems like I need to get inside the editor and change some numbers around. Last night I started playing within the editor and changed a bunch of fields to see what happened. That's about as specific as I can be, given how little I know. Many thanks, armen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, the best solution is to reinstall Winamp3 (or winamp2, whichever you have).<br />
      Make sure you have alll the installers for the AVS presets you have downloaded, or you can back-up the avs folder.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you really want the config window open you can edit studio.ini (contains avs setings) and set cfg_cfgwnd_open to 1. I don't think that'll do it though. It doesn't sound like an AVS confing problem to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I need a lot of space to do vj'ing to place my 400*300 avswindow + avseditor + hotlist. But it should be at least larger than average, so you can see everything clearly, so i got the option:<br />
      -one bigfatass 30" screen where you'd need a truck to carry it :igor: :p<br />
      -or 2 neat 17" screens, used as one wide screen and much more handy :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you're using XP or NT try using your task manager to see if AVS is running. Looks at the processes tab. If Studio.exe is taking of a decent portion of your CPU time, AVS is still running. If not, well, I don't think there's much I can help you with.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Firstly, please get back to us on whether AVS is still doing its thing in the background (check the CPU usage as mentioned above).<br />
      <br />
      If AVS is still running, then the window is probably outside your screen or something. You could ask some of the wasabii gurus on the winamp3 forum where this info is stored and how you can set it back to default.<br />
      <br />
      If AVS isn't running anymore, look for the file "vis_avs.dat" in your Winamp3\wacs directory. This file contains the last preset you where working on: it might be corrupt, causing AVS to crash/shutdown immediately. Try deleting it; this file only contains a copy of the preset, so if you saved it as a separate filename it won't be lost (it doesn't hurt to try this).</p>

      <p class="post-content">just set your resolution to a high one and it should appear, stick it back near tyhe middle and reset your resolution. Or if that doesn't work delete vis_avs.dat thats all i know of.</p>
