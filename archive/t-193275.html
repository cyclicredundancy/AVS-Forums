      <p class="post-content">Hmm, I guess I don't really think in terms of favorite tracks. I tend to find an album that I can put on repeat. So here are 7 current fave albums for spacing out on AVS with.<br />
      <br />
      SPACE ROCK:<br />
      The Verve - A Storm in Heaven<br />
      Spacemen 3 - An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music<br />
      Kinski - Airs Above Your Station<br />
      <br />
      TRANCE:<br />
      Juno Reactor - Bible of Dreams<br />
      Akasha Project - MDMA Tuning<br />
      Younger Brother - A Flock of Bleeps<br />
      <br />
      FUSION:<br />
      Mahavishnu Orchestra - The Inner Mounting Flame<br />
      <br />
      If I am too lazy to select and queu up an album then I will just randomly click on one of the online radio stations in my trance playlist.</p>

      It's just because most AVS presets are geared towards very loud and high on beats music (like everyone said, techno is best for testing), so that's why the songs might seem bad for AVS. But as soon as you start making presets that don't need 237 beats per minute or very loud input, you see that it's quite awesome and even better finally you can listen to something GOOD while viewing presets instead of something you have to listen to in order to get any kind of reaction out of them.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I wish i had time to download peoples reccomendations of songs for their AVS presets because I can imagine the preset taking on a new light, but hey, life's too short.<br />
      <br />
      I've been thinking for a while now that with all the new features (specifically gettime() and codable el's) you could quite easily make a 'music video', that is a preset designed specifically for a certain song that changed at key moments in the song and kicked in with spectacular effects at certain points. Its just being arsed to make it, I started one for a lemonjelly song but it was nine minutes long and I got sick of listening to the same 5 seconds over and over as I tweaked the effects.</p>

I call it a 'PAK Video', and there's a serious of complicated copyright and patent pending issues attached so don't even think about making one without expressed written consent and payment of a substantial licensing fee.
