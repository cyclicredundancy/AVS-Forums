<div class="posttext">Oakenfold is a great choice; always uplifting. For someone new to trance and electronica in general, Oakenfold's live sets would be my first reccommendation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">But once you realize that okenfold kinda sucks, you can then move into the subgenres! YAY! Industiral, rave, gibberish, goa, psy, etc... whatever fits your fancy.<br />
<br />
I am personaly more into the rave stuff, scooter mainly right now, but it changes with my mood.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like songs that aren't so beat heavy, &amp; more or less cresendo &amp; decresendo.  That's the real test of an AVS preset, how it can adapt to a slowly changing song, a la Sigur Ros.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
It's just because most AVS presets are geared towards very loud and high on beats music (like everyone said, techno is best for testing), so that's why the songs might seem bad for AVS. But as soon as you start making presets that don't need 237 beats per minute or very loud input, you see that it's quite awesome and even better finally you can listen to something GOOD while viewing presets instead of something you have to listen to in order to get any kind of reaction out of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Get Finnish Flash 8 (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=142914)<br />
<br />
Then get:<br />
Russell Cox - Super Mario RPG 'Farewell, Star Guardian' (http://www.ocremix.org/detailmix.php?mixid=OCR00724) and view &quot;Lullaby&quot; with this song.<br />
<br />
&amp;<br />
<br />
The Wingless - Super Metroid 'All the World in One Girl' (http://www.ocremix.org/detailmix.php?mixid=OCR01080) and view &quot;Piano of Passion&quot; with this song.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And tugg.... just.... just shutup. Your right, although generally I make presets that fit the music I listen to, but thats probably because I make all me presets for MEEE, all for MEEEEEE, not you...no no, meeeeee</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wish i had time to download peoples reccomendations of songs for their AVS presets because I can imagine the preset taking on a new light, but hey, life's too short.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking for a while now that with all the new features (specifically gettime() and codable el's) you could quite easily make a 'music video', that is a preset designed specifically for a certain song that changed at key moments in the song and kicked in with spectacular effects at certain points. Its just being arsed to make it, I started one for a lemonjelly song but it was nine minutes long and I got sick of listening to the same 5 seconds over and over as I tweaked the effects.</div></div><hr />

Pak-9, you're not the only one to think about that ;)Yes I am, anyone else who does it or talks about it is stealing the idea. I call it a 'PAK Video', and there's a serious of complicated copyright and patent pending issues attached so don't even think about making one without expressed written consent and payment of a substantial licensing fee.</div></div><hr />
