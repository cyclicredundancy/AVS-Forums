		Great for a first time!<br />
<br />
There were a couple ones that weren't that good, but the majority of it is really nice.  Sorry I don't have the time to write a review<br />
<br />
3.5 stars     <br />
<br />
Keep it up:up:

		phh. pixelcraft obviously has a real life to adhere to..<br />
luckily.. im stuck infront of my computer until i finish my philosophy and sociology essays.<br />
SO, heres my review:<br />
<br />
INTRO<br />
nicish.. im not sure, i think the movement is all way to fast..<br />
the sinsoid scrolling text at the bottom cant be read alot of the time.. which is a big poobar. Also you might want to put in a custom bpm so that the text doesnt change so quick when im listening to my Nine Inch Nails and prodigy tunes. I like the 'blocky partial out' effects.<br />
<br />
BUTTERFLY: WHOA!!! this is fucking cool!!! very beautiful scope. One concern, im only two presets into your pack, and ive already seen two n00bish starfields, just like every other starfield.<br />
<br />
HIPNO: im not sure if the play on words was intended, but hipno is normaly spelled with a 'Y'. If it was intended, i like it lots! The preset itself is pretty dull: one colour, one movement, no beat reaction. These things could all be fixed very eaasily and could turn this preset into a good one.<br />
<br />
ELECTRO: same deal as HIPno.<br />
<br />
FEEL: OH MY GOD! another awesome preset.. man you have a gift! either a smashing pumpkins or foo fighter fan by the looks. Yet another starfield, but this time its watered down and almost different looking.<br />
<br />
I WANNA: ARGHHHH GET IT WAY.. well, if 'you wanna', then do it.. but please dont let it reak havok on the rest of society.<br />
<br />
I GOT HIGH: what the fuck on? this is pretty wierd, some clever work with ordinary 'render/'s here. its not fab though.<br />
<br />
12'OCLOCK: eh. been done, and been done better before. (starfield #4)<br />
<br />
SUN: not really your best work. a nice idea though. Could be applied better with a 3d dm.<br />
<br />
TIME TRAVEL: seems to be a mix of youre worst two yet, 12'OCLOCK and I WANNA. You have replaced the dull starfield with the even duller dot grid. <br />
<br />
VX: starfield #5. Lots of really 00gly, blue scopes on top of each other.. that sums it up really.<br />
<br />
SOLAR: okay, thats it.. this is alot of really shitty presets in the middle of what started out as an avsome pack.. what is going on.. <br />
<br />
NOVA: *sigh*, getting better, i suppose...<br />
<br />
MTV: LOL, i like this one.. ide get rid of the 'extreme' spinning though, and try to fix up the edge pixel stretching by making the edge pixels solid colours. (when you use a dm or movement to make an image, or parts of that image, smaller than they were originally, you either get wrapping (if 'Wrap' is checked, or edge pixel stretching.)<br />
<br />
SQUARE STYLE: mmm.. right.. back to square one then..<br />
<br />
X FILES: a bit boring, but nice.. i take it your a big TV person. more of the edge pixel stretching thing on the s in files. A nice dm on that text. But i think the x should be alot greener if you want it to look like the show.<br />
<br />
DREAM: HAHA! THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABUOT!... i think this is probly my fav so far.. it might not go down to well with alot of other people though, they will probably say that it is too repeditive and so forth.<br />
<br />
GRAIN: yeah, ok.. needs more of that responce factor.<br />
<br />
PENTAGRAM: whoah, thats twisted.. this is another of your nicer presets, the DDM effect is a bit old though.<br />
<br />
NEVER V1: nice scopes, nice message.. But thats seems to be all their is.<br />
<br />
NEVER V2: Not as good as v1, both arnt great. <br />
<br />
SQUARE DANCE: ooh, nice shapes.. this could be among your best if you changed the colours. <br />
<br />
TRIP: as near as i can tell, this is a floating between two planes preset, but its all weird like, like im on acid or something.. crazy.<br />
that floating orb is really really really good.. i cant work out how the fuck you did it..  but it looks so crisp and real 3d..  amazing.<br />
I can see you being up there with the best avsers in a couple of packs time.. if not sooner. I love the floating between two planes effect with just ssc's, as far as i know, this preset is all original ideas, and very good ones too. I would expect a preset of this standard from someone like atero or tuggammeee.. very inovative.<br />
<br />
CUBE: a 3d cube with dome erratic 3d line scope.. well, you have to start somewhere with the 3d stuff.. not great. but keep it coming.<br />
oh, and theres another starfield in there too.<br />
<br />
SIMPLE 1: yukky.. yukky yukky yukky... starfield #.. oh fuck it, ive lost count.<br />
<br />
SIMPLE 2: congrats, you made the yukky preset into a 10^yukky preset.<br />
<br />
ON THE WAVE.. very nice water effect, more innovations.. this is by far the best water i have ever seen in avs.. pitty about the 'gaps' in the water.. nice sky aswell..<br />
<br />
FLAMES OF LOOOOOVEE: work on that fire.. i think it was el-vis that created the really cool fire effect. You can use his, cause everyone else seems to. the hearts are not as good as the first time you used them.<br />
<br />
OUTRO: eh.. its just an outro, i wont be mean.<br />
<br />
Phew, that was a lot of presets, i didnt realise how long it would take when i started.. All up, there are some fucking brilliant ideas heere, the best would probably be trip in my eye.. but, then again, i cant remeber the first ones now so im not sure... my advice is to stop making those gay n00bish ones that seemed to plague the middl eof your pack. And stop using starfield like that or sooner or later someone will get hurt.. <br />
<br />
Keep it coming..

		Decent start. It's a better than mine was. Also a lot bigger. I teld to enjoy smaller packs more. 30 presets is just too much. Gimme a pack of 10 good presets over a pack of 30 mediocre ones any day.<br />
<br />
Most of the precets in your pack looked okay, the just need a little development. Your coding is decent and you seem to know your way around a superscope and DM.

		VERY good presets.  Some of these remind me of HF presets, in a way.  But when you use other peoples' code, credit them in your presets (speaking specifically of your use of El-Vis's 3D engine, but there might be other things that I didn't see...)<br />
Also, write your own 3D code.  It's not that hard once you know the math.  AVS Primer :down: has an okay explanation of it, but I'll be updating it soon and then releasing a resource pack that will include a streamlined engine, plus some add-ons.  The upshot is El-Vis's engine is really slow, bulky, and hard to tweak, and you're better off figuring it out anyway.<br />
<br />
Don't have time to write a lengthy review, so I'll just say I'm watching out for you ;) Keep up the good work!

		In the preset &quot;Dream&quot; the movement is ripped off from the remix i made for uNDefineD from the preset &quot;Black hole flipside&quot; without you crediting me or uNDefineD! You fucking ripper!<br />
<br />
Why should i believe you have coded anything in your pack yourself now? :mad: You're just another sad ass ripper to me...

		bloody hell, i think it is enough that we just let him know that we all know he is ripping off others, and that you cant get away with it on this forum.. <br />
At least then he knows not too do it again.. <br />
btw, im betting that in a few months, everman will not need to rip off anyone to make awesome presets. moreov, the n00bs then will be ripping off him!

		sorry for ripping i should give information i the comment: &quot;this is remix of... made by... &quot; :( but i think that the imitation is the best way to learn new think (on the start) and like say ALF: &quot;the imitation is the honest form of plagiarism&quot; ;) (joke)... sorry again (and sorry for my english)

<br />
Im only human too... and i just get pissed off very easily when i see even the slightest ripping...<br />
<br />
But it's ok now since everyman realized that he needs to credit people for their work, it's cool to use it if you credit them for it, that's all.<br />
