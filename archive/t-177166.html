<div class="posttext">Before I begin I will say that I have done a search and found answers to my questions but all seemed different in each of the topics.I would like to get specific answers to my questions incase they were not what i needed.<br />
<br />
Im using WinXP-Radeon7000-Athlon 1.25-512MB RAM<br />
<br />
First question is when I go fullscreen on VIS,I get black borders all around rather than FULL fullscreen.How can I change this or does it even really matter.....into question 2.....<br />
I want to output to my TV.I have a Panasonic 47 HDTV widescreen.Will the black bars show up?<br />
And what is the recomended way to do this?<br />
I was thinking of using a seperate box with just Winamp and all my music.Thus not worrying about cp usage being to much or high.<br />
<br />
I listen to music alot and often have people over while putting a few down and listening to music.It would be nice to watch visualizations on a big screen.<br />
<br />
I know these questions have been brought up before,but like I said,the answers seemed to lead away from the question at hand and confuse me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :up:</div></div><hr />
