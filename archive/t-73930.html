      <p class="post-content"><strong>could someone help me please?</strong><br />
      if you have an oscilloscope or something with a dynamic shift on it, is it possible to just see the effect of the dynamic shift without seeing the thing it came from? if that makes sense.<br />
      <br />
      also does anyone know where I can find a simple tutorial on how to do superscopes(for someone who failed maths and can barely add and subtract)? I've managed to make some crazy looking stuff justby changing random numbers but I'd like toknow how to do it properly.<br />
      <br />
      much greatfulness to anyone who helps.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nigel, that first question has me stumped. lol.<br />
      <br />
      The second question regarding superscopes:<br />
      <br />
      There are many variables that can go into superscopes, and there isn't one single formula you can use to make one. Unfortunately I don't even know how to make them yet. At this point, you may have to continue fooling around with other superscopes that have been developed, because you can make them change a whole lot by just shifting one element, such as changing tan to log10, or changing +d to -d, or whatever.<br />
      <br />
      Keep trying experimentation. It takes a while to learn this stuff, and sometimes your greatest presets are made by accident!<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice one aar<br />

      I think I'll give up on superscopes for now until someone brings out "wvs for dummies"</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>is that what you want?</strong><br />
      take a look to a new superscope, best you create a new preset...take a blur(trans/blur) so you will see every move of the SuperScope.. then you take the superscope...in the init, ther's "n=800" let it, it's the number of points SS draws..<br />
      the OnBeat field is empty... don't care about it this time...the PerFrame field is just something that is to do every frame, "t=t-0.05" is for speed, it's a kind of countdown, you can change the value if you want to speed up or slow down your SS... make the "-" to a "+" and you will change the direction...<br />
      <br />
      Per Point..that says SS what is to do for every point...delet all...write new: "x=sin(t);y=cos(t)" what you can see is a circle, why that is, i can't explane good, because my born language is not english...but if you change one side to "tan(t)" you will see, what it changes... so play with somethings and learn....<br />
      i hope it would be helpfull for you<br />
