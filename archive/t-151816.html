      I usually don't like posting unfinished preset, but this time I have a problem that you guys might know how to solve.<br />
      <br />
      If you load the preset, you'll see that the light sometimes goes in the box in the cube. I would like to see that fixed without removing the random movements of the box and the light. I tried to make the light stay on a cylinder around the box, when it comes to close, but that wouldn't work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Could you give some more info on the vars? Doesn't make much sense to me now.<br />
      <br />
      What are the coordinates of the light... of the box? How are they projected? Under what conditions is the light in the box?<br />
      <br />
      Very nice effect btw. Very knipperlichtjes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like it :) It indeed has great lighting effects, and indeed nogal knipperlichtjes :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tried to make a list of the used vars.<br />
      <br />
      ---<br />
      In frame:<br />
      <br />
      ox, oy, oz: the coördinates of the light<br />
      xm, ym: coördinates of the moving box<br />
      rx, ry, rz: the rotation angles, these are made from ox, oy, oz. This isn't really necessary for the ssc, but it was in the dynmov that the code was written in at first.<br />
      rs: the rotation around the y-axis after raytracing is done.<br />
      cs: zooming in on the cube for a bit more dynamic action.<br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      In pixel:<br />
      ----<br />
      r1, r2: the theta and phi for a orb.<br />
      x1, y1, z1: the coördinates of the orb<br />
      <br />
      Then there's the 3d rotation code.<br />
      <br />
      k1, k2, k3, k4: the k of the sides of the moving box<br />
      k5 to k10: the k of the sides of the cube<br />
      <br />
      kx, ky, kz: these are the lowest values of the planes parrallel to either the x, y or z axis. These values were aren't really necessary, but they clean up the code a bit. I'm thinking of using them in the colorcoding.<br />
      k: the lowest value of kx, ky and kz.<br />
      ix, iy, iz: you could actually use these values already to make the ssc, but I wanted rotation, which will be done next.<br />
      <br />
      xx, zz: the ix, iy and iz are rotated around the y-axis, to make the cube moving, instead of what you see in most raytraced ssc presets.<br />
      <br />
      And then you have the projection code.<br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      The light is in the box, when (0.5+ox+xm)&lt;ox&lt;(-0.5+ox+xm) and (0.5+oy+ym)&lt;oy&lt;(-0.5+oy+ym).</p>

      Neat effects skupers - unfortunately this kind of stuff is way over my head....
