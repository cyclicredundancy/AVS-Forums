<div class="posttext">Hi There<br />
My Avs presets MADE IN IRAN is now published in Winamp.com,<br />
and staff gave it 3 stars.<br />
I have not any expect that my AVS presets is the best one, No, I am Beginner. My talk is to Winamp user opinions that they said to me abusive. Because My name is Mohammad Ali Rezapanah and my country is IRAN!!!<br />
After September 11th, American people &amp; european people have hate from The Middle East peoples. And they thought every body that live in The Middle East is Terrorist.<br />
This Believe is wrong.<br />
I hope in the future peoples remain civilized &amp; gave stars to art NOT to Nationality.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">People are not being unfair - they give your pack what they think it deserves. It has nothing to do with your nationality.<br />
<br />
Please do not try and accuse everyone of being racist here, it's very unfair to the majority of people on the forums. Your behaviour is very disappointing. Please do not claim that people are voting based on your race, as I most certainly believe this is not the case here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There is nothing said about iran in their reviews.<br />
<br />
My guess for their low ratings is that they are reacting to your &quot;reviews&quot; of all of the other presets.  One of the people gave you a low mark for this, and I wouldn't doubt if the others did as well.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't take user ratings seriously - most of them either give a 0 or a 5 depending on whether they liked it or not - they don't really have a middle ground.  We(The AVS Reviewers) try to give as unbiased of a review as we can, and I know that there is no form of discrimination in this review.  Nobody seems to be giving you low marks because of your nationality - they probably have other reasons.  If these reviews are offensive to you, some of the higher-ups can remove the reviews.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yup, nationalism aside, nobody really cares about it around here.<br />
<br />
But why the hell you always cut&amp;paste the reviews? :igor: For a long time i thought you were a bot...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When I'm reviewing presets it doesn't matter whether the person who made them is a Muslim, Christian, Jewish or some Animalist bowing to a monkey, or if you're from Iran, Tonga or Tadjikistan or Cook Islands, you get the same criteria as everyone else. You are kinda pissing off people by copy/pasting the staff review. Believe it or not, some gullible people think YOU'RE the reviewer and that pisses of reviewers sometimes. Reviewing is believe it or not quite hard work. But that doesn't influence me at all, I may have a personal grudge against you (and I don't) but I don't give you bad ratings because of that. Try to make better presets and people will give you better grades. However we don't control what people write. There will always be some moron who is being a bastard because he can, or another type of moron - those who can't tell ,say, Iran from Iraq. Ok, those two coutries have similar names. But there are some (well, sadly, most) people from a certain country I won't name (USA) ;), who can't tell Europe from Asia (luckily, most people I know are normal people and know that, but I've talked to (and met) people who don't know that), who will abuse you. I've seen the reviews people made, and they definitely don't look abusive (it looks as if noone gave that bad review because you're muslim or from iran), they simply didn't like your presets...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">To be honest I think it's more of a weirdo joke by resident noisebot Mohammad Ali Rezapanah. He's been reposting the staff reviews for virtually every component.<br />
<br />
If people downrated him for being him, it's not because he's from Iran, but because he was an annoying brat. Racism has nothing to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Alright, I'm just going to say it - I do not like mohammed because of his annoying parrot-like qualities.  He just mimics what we say, and that is really annoying.<br />
<br />
In reviewing his pack, I did not use that to judge against him though.  My rating of his presets had only to do with the presets.  They weren't horrible, but I've seen better.  The users who submit their own reviews are normally not so kind.  If they have a personal grudge then they will not give a good score - even if the presets are great.  Don't even try bringing discrimination based on nationality into this, because you have not standing whatsoever on that.  You have basically been blackmarked because of your &quot;reviews&quot;, so I wouldn't listen to user reviews that much - they won't be actual reviews of the presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well hey, we got Mr 007 from Iran, and you should see him talk!  Maybe it's the same kinda thing with this guy.  But on the other hand, posting staff reviews is a pretty stupid thing to do, so I'm conflicted....<br />
<br />
I hate racists.  There nothing but a bunch of losers who think they're superior to every other race.  It's stupid.  I thought we got over racism a long time ago, back in the slaves day, but I guess not.  What is so wrong with foreign people?  About 75% of the people in the forums aren't American.  And what's so bad about your rating?  3 stars isn't that bad....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">first off, it really saddens me that you'd think that about any of our reviewers, or that nullsoft/the admins would put preople like that in charge of anything.  second, don't go begging for an improved rating on the basis that you're from iran and people &quot;don't like you&quot;.  that really burns me :hang:</div></div><hr />
