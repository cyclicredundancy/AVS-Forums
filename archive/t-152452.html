<div class="posttext">Ok, actually i got a really big problem.<br />
I am almost done with Hotlist 2.3 and it is technically working fine, even with avs 2.7<br />
<br />
But i'm stuck at one sucky problem and i do need your help really bad.<br />
<br />
The new version will provide settings for the following things:<br />
-playing time in seconds<br />
-playing time in beats<br />
-playing time style (which one of the two above will be taken)<br />
-transitions on/off<br />
-transition styles (all that avs offers)<br />
-transition time (as avs offers)<br />
-transitions w/wo render old effect<br />
<br />
These settings will apply to each preset, as well as to a generell set of settings.<br />
<br />
You may choose which settings shall use the customized (preset defined) settings and which one should use the general settings. Furthermore, there will be a switch to override the custom settings completely and switch to the general ones for direct action.<br />
<br />
As i said, technically its all fine but i am stuck at how the users interface shall look like.<br />
<br />
At first i had one control which would display always the currently used options.<br />
Then i made two seperate controls for each, custom and general settings.<br />
Finally i implemented both and tried to color the custom controls diffrently than the general ones.<br />
<br />
Still nothing was confident enough yet and rather likely to confuse the user.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please!!!<br />
How would you like to work with this feature???</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Let me get this right - you want the layout to work DURING a live vjing session? Why not assign hotkeys. At the end of the day - are we really going to be using 15 different transition/beat detection settings? <br />
<br />
Great idea customising it that way though. Thats a truly valuable tool and I've been looking for something like it for quite some time. <br />
<br />
It would also be great if there could be a 'live' effect imlementer. Perhaps an .ape could be inserted into all of the presets - hotlist could hotkey a few effects into the running preset. Would add that extra dynamic element to a show for sure.</div></div><hr />

@Legohead:<br />
<br />
This is basically meant to do your fine tunings on your set BEFORE it started. <br />
<br />
You tell each preset:<br />
-1) How long it may be played (beats or seconds)<br />
-2) Wheter it has to be played:<br />
    a) for a certain amount of seconds<br />
    b) for a certain amount of beats<br />
    c) for a certain amount of seconds but next preset may not start until next beat<br />
-3) To use Transitions in general<br />
-4) Which Transition to use<br />
-5) Which Transtion tim to use<br />
-6) To render the old effect or not<br />
<br />
Note: transition settings apply to the fade-in transtion<br />
<br />
<br />
Now as you set up each AVS Preset, you may select which of those (1-6) will actually apply in your VJ-Set!!! This may be only the transition effect or playing time or any weird combination.<br />
<br />
Those options that will not use your preset-defined settings will use your general ones. Within any point of your set you may use the Generalisation switch to override your active preset defined settings completely as long as you like.<br />
<br />
This will make it possible to have a VJ-Set without beeing behind the PC!!!<br />
<br />
As far as the ape thing goes: i would implement it if someone would develope a bunch of usefull effects.</div></div><hr />

Download Buggy Beta Version here! (http://psytrancecamp.de/Hotlist/hotlist23.zip) <br />
To run the beta version, you need to have hotlist 2.2 installed and configured.<br />
I have to say that this version is (due to recent changes) veeeery buggy. Use it at your own risk. Note that i introduced a new file format for 2.3 so you'd maybe better backup your original hotlist folder completely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ROFL!<br />
<br />
Developement versions are ALWAYS buggy otherwise they would be finaly versions. And even they are buggy or why else would Microsoft have to publish service packs???</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok, Hotlist v2.2 works fine with win2000, winamp 5 and AVS 2.7 pre 8! :)<br />
But v2.3 have some bugs: the avs dir settings and the security option do not work properly :(<br />
*german on*<br />
&quot;listenindex ueberschreitet maximum (12)&quot; and<br />
&quot;(dir...)ist kein gueltiger Integerwert&quot; :p<br />
<br />
die transition optionen hast du aber gut gemacht, weiter so!<br />

<div class="posttext">I know that some of the settings are still a bit twisted tue to taking all the settings to one form. I am working on it and i hope i'll have more time for this now as my b-day party last WE took a lot of preparation time. ;)</div></div><hr />
