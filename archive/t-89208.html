      <p class="post-content"><strong>Roto Blitter/Blitter Feedback Range</strong><br />
      What I had in mind is a Roto Blitter or a Blitter Feedback where you can select a range of what to zoom in &amp; out/rotate. That way it can have a gradient within the range for OnBeat, instead of 2 zoom settings; one regular; and a different zoom to occur in the OnBeat selection. This is most likely a separate Trans, probably not a modification to the original RotoBlitter/Blitter Feedback.<br />
      <br />
      I'm aware that this can be done with DM, but I think it would be a cool idea for newbies.<br />
      <br />
      I don't think anybody has suggested this before (I used the search the forums command)-so please tell me what you think</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>allright</strong><br />
      Will nullsoft publish another version of playlister ? nobody know...Maybe we should do stuffs by ourself :):<br />
      <br />
      Well, I don't know very much about DM and SSC coz' I'm not very good at maths...I use lots of BMPs and AVIs in my shows in france and I think it would be great to have lot of 'predefined' effects included in AVS...I think that THE big miss of the AVS community (yes! I think there's one:)) are APEs programmers...So please, if you're a programmer (C++) please join the APE programming thread :), we've lot of ideas and littles programming skills :)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry</strong><br />
      Sorry, but all my high school teaches is Java. I'm still trying to learn Java from a book I bought at the bookstore (I'm not taking the class until 2 years from now). If I knew C++, I would help if I could. Sorry, but I'm kind of a beginner at programming<br />
      <br />
      --Edit--:<br />
      I'm still trying to learn DM. And even though I'm a lot better at superescopes than DMs, there's lots more that I don't know in comparison to what I do know.<br />
