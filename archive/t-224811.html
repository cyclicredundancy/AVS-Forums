			<strong>winamp crashing</strong><br />
		
		

		Ive been using AVS for a while so I know that it will cause winamp to crash occasionally but recently it has been crashing  whenever I try to open a specific preset I was working on. It started doing this after I had upgraded to the latest version of winamp. When I looked at the windows error report it said that colormap.ape was the problem. I would delete this from the preset, but it always crashes when I try to open it. Does anyone know how I can fix this?

		You can rename the &quot;colormap.ape&quot; file, which will effectively disable the &quot;Color Map&quot; effect in all your presets. Then you should be able to remove it from your preset (in case some of the data was corrupted somehow).<br />
<br />
It's also possible, though, that the problem is in your &quot;colormap.ape&quot; file instead of your preset. You should confirm that other presets that use &quot;Color Map&quot; still work correctly.

		I tried renaming the file but that didn't work. I was able to disable it by moving it to a different folder. Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
thanks, but I solved the problem already.

		Try getting a preset pack that has colormap in the installer (most installers that were made with pimpbot have it).<br />
The installer should install a new one if colormap isn't in the /avs dir. (which you have moved to another directory)<br />
<br />
If your old colormap was corrupted, this should fix it.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, the problem lies somewhere else. (obvious, but true :p)
