		AVS is a visualization for winamp alone.<br />
an ipod doesn't use Winamp anymore after the files have been transmitted.<br />
<br />
I don't own an ipod, so I can't tell you anyting about other visuals, but I know that AVS is not an option.

ok thanks<br />
<br />
i thought that winamp had a linux version, which would then mean that MAYBE you could code visual stuff for it but i dont know :)

		nope, there's no linux version. i don't know but doesn't rockbox (alternative firmware for ipods, etc) allow for some form of vis but due to the processor abilities on the ipod i doubt you'd be able to even get anywhere new to avs style support<br />

yeah im looking into that thanks :) <br />
there is some 3d games for ipod video so i was thinking maybe it could cope with some avs style stuff, also considering it isnt running much else other than the firmware<br />
<br />
thanks though guys :)

Installed Winamp for Linux... but couldn't run the Executable though. :D<br />

Even if there was, that's not what she's looking for.

		that's Winamp3 and not Winamp as was being refered to. also no open supports that alpha version and since the whole Winamp3 support is no more i wouldn't even suggest recommending that to anyone. hence why i said no (especially when being pedantic and holding to product names strictly ;) )<br />

		AVS uses too much API to run on anything else without extensive porting or emulation. To the best of my knowledge the only way to run AVS under *nix is with something like Wine or VMWare for Linux.
