<div class="posttext">AVS is a visualization for winamp alone.<br />
an ipod doesn't use Winamp anymore after the files have been transmitted.<br />
<br />
I don't own an ipod, so I can't tell you anyting about other visuals, but I know that AVS is not an option.</div></div><hr />

ok thanks<br />
<br />
i thought that winamp had a linux version, which would then mean that MAYBE you could code visual stuff for it but i dont know :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nope, there's no linux version. i don't know but doesn't rockbox (alternative firmware for ipods, etc) allow for some form of vis but due to the processor abilities on the ipod i doubt you'd be able to even get anywhere new to avs style support<br />

<br />
yeah im looking into that thanks :) <br />
there is some 3d games for ipod video so i was thinking maybe it could cope with some avs style stuff, also considering it isnt running much else other than the firmware<br />
<br />
thanks though guys :)</div></div><hr />

Installed Winamp for Linux... but couldn't run the Executable though. :D<br />
<br />
Google::: &quot;Winamp Linux&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">there is no official winamp for linux.<br />
<br />
Even if there was, that's not what she's looking for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's Winamp3 and not Winamp as was being refered to. also no open supports that alpha version and since the whole Winamp3 support is no more i wouldn't even suggest recommending that to anyone. hence why i said no (especially when being pedantic and holding to product names strictly ;) )<br />

<div class="posttext">AVS uses too much API to run on anything else without extensive porting or emulation. To the best of my knowledge the only way to run AVS under *nix is with something like Wine or VMWare for Linux.</div></div><hr />
