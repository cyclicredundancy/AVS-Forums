<div class="posttext">A few 'standard' like texer bitmaps i did, because i've seen a lot of people using UnConeD's texer bitmaps and i really don't understand why? Is it because:<br />
<br />
1) People are lazy to make their own<br />
2) People just don't know how to use or don't own a drawing/image editing program<br />
3) UnConeD just kicks ass and his texer bitmaps kick ass. (unfortunally i can't do anything about it :p)<br />
<br />
Any of these reasons (except the last one) was a good enough reason for me to make a few texer bitmaps that vary in size.<br />
<br />
So here they are, i hope my fellow AVSters find them useful  You can use them freely in your packs, or edit them (but remember to save them in a different name preferably your own), also you can distribute them along your pack as long as they remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
Have fun &amp; enjoy<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh and here is a picture of 'the plan' :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Cool idea Tugg :up:<br />
Provides the n00bs with a good basic texer pack to deal with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well it isn't just for the n00bs, more experienced avsers shouldn't be ashamed of using it either, if they simply can't make their own (point 2) :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, i got it now. <br />
I used to create graphics for years so i didn't thought of people who can code but are not familiar with graphics. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good one Tugg, this way also the AVS root directory won't fill up so fast as usual with texer or picture preset images.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Graet thing Tugg. I used UnConeD texers because they seemed to do the job I wanted. When i need a specialone i make it but I usualy try all of the ones already made by other ppl. No use makeing somethin that is already there:). Anyway Im sure im gonna use these a lot THX.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i got another 40 texer images, which i started for a similiar project (together with tuggummi). when i found out about the texer bug (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=139772) i put this on ice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">One little bug :|<br />
I told you, the people need more options besides whacko texers :p<br />
Come on! Just post em here ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th October 2003, 19:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well some of my whacko texers are just circles, so it's understandable people would use them. This is great though, a set of standard images at all sizes is great!<br />
<br />
yathosho here's on for you... what is the standard way of extracting a file with NSIS but not to overwrite it if it exists? Should be used for these images...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the &quot;setoverwrite ifnewer&quot; flag does it for me...don't quote me on that tho, i don't remember the exact syntax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th October 2003, 13:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hehe i always knew someone would do it before me:p but anyway thats a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ishan, lol :D<br />
<br />
Though for more 'exotic' texers you still have to use what-ever you want to use (or do them yourself).<br />
<br />
Im thinking about making a few more, maybe a bit more weird and unusual texers this time, how about some 'animated' texer bitmaps :D Like unconed did in his intergalactic octopussy preset, by splitting the texer image into red,green &amp; blue channels and then using a simple color code to change between them :) Tho i only have 3 frames to use, could be damn hard to make any cool animations with only 3 frames...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">octopussy... lol<br />
<br />
btw, good idea tugg, this should be useful for people that use texer, i don't really use it tho. great job anyway :)</div></div><hr />
