      A few 'standard' like texer bitmaps i did, because i've seen a lot of people using UnConeD's texer bitmaps and i really don't understand why? Is it because:<br />
      <br />
      1) People are lazy to make their own<br />
      2) People just don't know how to use or don't own a drawing/image editing program<br />
      3) UnConeD just kicks ass and his texer bitmaps kick ass. (unfortunally i can't do anything about it :p)<br />
      <br />
      Any of these reasons (except the last one) was a good enough reason for me to make a few texer bitmaps that vary in size.<br />
      <br />
      So here they are, i hope my fellow AVSters find them useful You can use them freely in your packs, or edit them (but remember to save them in a different name preferably your own), also you can distribute them along your pack as long as they remain unchanged.<br />
      <br />
      Have fun &amp; enjoy<br />
      <br />
      <br />

      Oh and here is a picture of 'the plan' :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well some of my whacko texers are just circles, so it's understandable people would use them. This is great though, a set of standard images at all sizes is great!<br />
      <br />
      yathosho here's on for you... what is the standard way of extracting a file with NSIS but not to overwrite it if it exists? Should be used for these images...</p>

      Though for more 'exotic' texers you still have to use what-ever you want to use (or do them yourself).<br />
      <br />
      Im thinking about making a few more, maybe a bit more weird and unusual texers this time, how about some 'animated' texer bitmaps :D Like unconed did in his intergalactic octopussy preset, by splitting the texer image into red,green &amp; blue channels and then using a simple color code to change between them :) Tho i only have 3 frames to use, could be damn hard to make any cool animations with only 3 frames...</p>
