      I have noticed that whenever I close WA5 with the visualizer open. Then the next time I go into WA5, it is closed. I would like it to stay open, this is very annoying for me, cause I open it alot and like to have the visualizer to be open. I would like to also recommend a locking feature for file types. I would like to see something like the movie file stuff, you know. If it's a movie file, open video player. I would like to see an option to have "If it's a non-video file/music file, open Visualizer. Maybe even a "certain file types" list. It would make it alot easier for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Press Ctrl+P to open the preferences and go to Plug-ins.<br />
      There you can activate "auto execute visualisation plug-in on playback". But for me it is annoying, if AVS is always running (it slows down my pc). I prefer to click on that arrow under the video/vis when I need AVS.</p>

      UnConeD, I started up WA when I got home today and it came up with the Visualizer. Now, I have noticed that when opening/closing WA it opens or closes the Visualizer. Anyways, This seems to be acting really weird. But I'm glad a visualizer is there. My computer doesn't have any problems with the visualizer running, Then again, I have about 768 megs of RAM and a 2.4 Ghz processor. So WA only uses about 10 megs, and 7-8% of processor power when it is on top with visualizer open. So, I'm very happy with it.</p>
