      It might be handy to have the possibility of having subdirectories in your avs map. At this time you can only select your AVS's from the main AVS directory, and one level of subdirectories. Since I download A LOT OF other peoples pack, it could come in handy to have the possibility of making subdirs in other subdirs. Hope you all share this idea, would be great if it came true.<br />

      </blockquote>yeah, it gets annoying sometimes.<br />
      while making my pack, the preset titled 10 - .... came before 9 - ... just because the ninth one was made after the tenth one.<br />
      actually the ninth one was made before the tenth one, but was saved as a different name. then i opened avs opened the ninth preset ( which was named differently) then named it as the ninth preset.<br />
      :confused: :weird: :eek:
