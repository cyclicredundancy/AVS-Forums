				As the days weeks and even months go by, Bitmapped II is finally getting nearer to the end point... It's not coming anytime soon though, but some improvement has been made. I currently have 11 presets and im aiming for 20 presets.<br />
<br />
The reason why it's so slow to work on the pack is that i first have to have an idea for a preset, then make the bitmap and after that the actual avs stuff. Sure there is couple of &quot;random&quot; presets i have made, but most of the time i knew what i wanted in the begining and that is what makes it hard for me. Also my very limited skills in the graphics sector are slowing me down, luckily some nice people have agreed and already helped me out in that part, my thanks to those people, your names will be reviewed when the pack comes out :) <br />
<br />
Also a fair warning might be in place at the moment. Bitmapped II is going to be a huge pack in filesize, atleast 1mb. Also the presets will require quite a lot of cpu power since they are a bit more detailed than my usual presets and using pictures slows them down (even with Picture Render II the presets run pretty slow)<br />
<br />
That's all i wanted to say for now, next time should be the publification of the actual pack :)

Remixed Kesken2. This remix really looks like Trapped Starfish combined with Flower Tail.. Strange thing ;)

		Haha, really nice remix mquadrat :) But Kesken means &quot;unfinished&quot; in Finnish, lol :D<br />
<br />
Btw. You guys can put what ever remixes you make out of them to your own packs, because im at the time making my Bitmapped II pack and it should be finished within 2 weeks. Also you can rename the &quot;Kesken2&quot; preset if you want ;) (just don't forget <b>me</b> mmmkay?)
