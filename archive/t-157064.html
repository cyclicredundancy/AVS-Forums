      <p class="post-content">why not teaming up with m&#194;&#178;k, who's working on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dilate/" target="_blank">dilate</a>. the more players support it, the better the chances it could become a standard.</p>

      <p class="post-content">For a second I thought this was going to be another "I'm a n00b please help me" threads. I'm glad I was wrong. As for your question, I don't think that there is specific data in an mp3 for that purpose. I might be wrong but as far as I know, you have to get the data from the sound it's self.</p>

      not to mention that looking around the website for five minutes would've found you your answer.<br />
      <br />
      not to mention c# is server side web scripting and not anything to do with anything to do with winamp (afaik)</p>
