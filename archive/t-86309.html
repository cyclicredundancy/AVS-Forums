<div class="posttext">Well heres my first presets, they dont really have a theme but they are all original.Any feedback/critisism would be appreciated.If your real smart maybe you could look at my super scopes and DM's and give me a few pointers if you could. thanks. peace. -Chad</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You got some nice stuff there. I liked simple, some new shit, and blackandwhite.<br />
<br />
Some didn't appeal to me. (I never liked that while movement combined with water effect) I enjoy presets that evoke a feeling rather than try to look like something.<br />
<br />
One thing about the DM in black and white. You're using the variable b. It's always  1 or 0, depending on whether there's a beat. Usually when you want stuff done on the beat you use the onbeat section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">stayin_stoned</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th April 2002, 20:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">personally some new shit and black and white are my fav's too,<br />
And as for using B in my black and white preset, i dont really have a<br />
reason,B doesn't seem to react as much as the on beat code area, and all i wanted to do was plug a constant(acually 0.4) in to perframe easily, although im sure the onbeat box is probably better/ maybe even eassier but i gotta lets the shit flow how it comes out, if you can show me how to make the same preset, without b in there(should'nt be too hard) then post me a copy. thanks , later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here ya go. It doesn't use b.<br />
<br />
No way is really the right way, it just that when doing complex stuff, it can be easier to follow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You're still using b in the per frame section. :p  I liked the name of the variable.<br />
<br />
Interscope 2 in pretty neat. It could use some more obvious beat responce though. maybe have the red scope switch directions, or speed up and gradually slow down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, i like where im goin with some of these presets but, i know i need to be critical of my own work in order to learn more(thats the whole point for me..),any way, my presets are pretty bland i.e.:they are ok too watch for 1-2 minutes or so but thats the max,i want to learn how to make my SS's more dynamic as well as my DM's so that my presets will be more interesting for a longer period of time,i also could use some help in learning about buffers and effect lists, but im sure i can find that in the forums. If some one can help it would be cool, thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th April 2002, 17:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, buffers are a screen dump. That it. The magical thing about buffers is what you do with them. You can use them as a source for your DMs (this allows you to use apha blending), a filter to blend the effects in an effect list (don't know how to use that yet), or just to restore the old picture.<br />
<br />
Effect lists are just a group of items that can be added to the preset in different ways.<br />
<br />
Simple explanations, but starting point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">An effect list is a preset-inside-a-preset... <br />
<br />
By the way Jaheckelsafar, a buffer blend takes the grayscale value of the buffer as the transparency level for that pixel.</div></div><hr />
