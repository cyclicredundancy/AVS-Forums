      <p class="post-content"><strong>feedback for me?</strong><br />
      Heyo.<br />
      <br />
      My latest avs pack have been published, and I'm finding that I don't really know what I can do to improve the visualizations. I know they're kind of good, but I also know they're kinda... well, "blah" I guess. Whenever I try to make a new one, it always looks like one I've done before.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I need some outside opinions, which is where you can help out...<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>don't need much help</strong><br />
      Hey: you're already very good at AVS, so you probably don't need much help from us. You might try making some DMs that will zoom in, swirl, &amp; reverse on beat. That's my only suggestion for you (I had crescents in mind when I made this suggestion). Just keep learning your superscope stuff &amp; make better DMs. You've already learned so much that at this point, I'm sure you can figure it out :) I really like your movements &amp; DMs</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>one more possible suggestion</strong><br />
      Well, I can't really make good DMs on my own, so I can only make suggestions on regular movements. You might try movement variations to produce mirror-like kaleidiscope effects. You can look at some of my presets if you'd like an example of this. You can get them through the link in my signature called AVS Preview Pack. Then just DL the zip called "check these out.zip"<br />
      <br />
      One suggestion-can you possibly post a zip with the GeissFluid APE in this thread? And for your next pack could you PiMP it so it will extract the APE to C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\AVS\</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd have to agree with the staff's comment on this, right idea, wrong excecution.<br />
      <br />
      And when you publish packs, make sure you include any extra APEs *hint hint*</p>

      <p class="post-content">Eh, not bad.<br />
      <br />
      the movement in Crazy Mosaic reminded me of a development version of Moving Kaliedoscope. (get it <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components/detail.jhtml?componentId=101466" target="_blank">here</a>) It looked like you started to do some zooming but ended up not using it. You trying to copy me? ;)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, like cmountford said, try your hand at more DMs. You know how they work, and how to use them, so do so. It looked like most of your superscopes were fairly basic, so you might wanna work on them. Try doing some of the stuff you did with a scope and a DM with just a scope.<br />
      <br />
      Hey, your pack got more DLs than mine.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm very...oldschool :D. I just realized that hardly anybody still uses PiMP, now they use NSIS. I'm still using PiMP, though. I'll take a look at NSIS. I haven't used either in ages, though. Just wanted to point out how oldschool I am.</p>
