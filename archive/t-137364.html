		Weee...Obviously a takeoff of the Mystify Your Mind screensaver that comes with windows.  The colors aren't perfect (it uses the fast hue converter, ick), I'm working on it tho...<br />
Requires Tom Holden's Video Delay APE.<br />
<br />
An odd bug with the video delay ape (on my comp, at least) is that you have to bring up the config window for it to apply the settings you chose.  Otherwise it sticks to the default (10 frames).  Does anyone else get this?

Where did Holden go anyway? He didn't do the promised update to convolution to allow switching between boxes with the arrow keys.

		Maybe he went to hell like I told him to :D<br />

(j/k ;))<br />

<br />
so were the jiggleez a good addition?  if you don't know what i'm talking about, play some loud music and it should start to jiggle....

		The jiggles look bad IMO... anyway I prefer it without videodelay and higher-speed, like xp1=xp1+xs1*3; (or what about sound-dependant speed?)<br />
<br />
Funny how I always manage to disagree with you completely about every aspect of a preset... ;)<br />
<br />
Cool technically and for nostalgia value, but that's about it.

		I like the idea, but i don't like how it turned out, I would have liked it more if it was faster, did not have the jiggle in it, had wider lines, and a slower fadeout speed.

		Didn't notice any jiggles. I think it looks more like the real thing with the video delay, but I like it better with a faster fadeout.

		Yup, not much in this than technical know-how and nostalgia. Pretty nice, but the jiggles bother me a lot too. And what's all this screensaver thingies that everybody seems to be making these days? :p :blah:

		No to mention the fact that screensavers are useless... who the heck wants to have pretty stuff on their screen <i>when they're not there to watch it</i>? :P<br />
I guess it's one of those things for in the workplace, so fellow collegues can 'oooooh' and 'aaaah' at your l33t screensaver downloading skills :p.<br />
<br />
Just use powersave mode if you really want to save your screen...

		UnConeD: As a matter of fact screen savers really do save my screen.  And the rest of the contents of my RAM.  My comp crashes when it's not doing anything, and with 32 megs RAM I make sure it's not doing more than two things at the same time.  When I'm not at it I have it running a screen saver just to make sure something's running through it's memory, so it doesn't lock up.<br />
<br />
(Don't fucking ask me why it does that, it just DOES...:hang: )

		I like the look of it but it doesn't go well with techno or anything fast. Hey, I know I wouldn't come up with such a good idea.(You want me to start on avatars again, Ishan. Lets see how off topic we can get on this thread.) :D
