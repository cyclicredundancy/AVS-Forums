<div class="posttext">Somehow i don't think you're talking about AVS there. If you are please specify. Are you using winamp 2 or 3? (if 3 i have to recommend going back to 2, it really is that much better). you should go to either:<br />
here for winamp 3: http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=131<br />
or here for winamp 2: http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=11</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">try opening the video window! i dont think you will see a video in the AVS screen. or if the video is in .avi format, then try the AVS renderer</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think what is wrong is that you don't have the codecs required.  I believe you are probably trying to watch divx video, and you need to download a divx component for it to play in winamp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My excuses for posting here, but is it possible to import the DivX codec into the Winamp (3) Video player? <br />
<br />
Note: I'm not talking 'bout the AVS window ;)</div></div><hr />
