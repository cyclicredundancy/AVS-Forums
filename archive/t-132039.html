      i've been trying to get my music vids to play! and all that comes up is a blank screen the little Winamp Video screen will pop up. but it won't show the picture. the music will play, but the video won't play. i have RealOnePlayer and Quicktime and Dell Jukebox by musicmatch. i don't know if that's gonna help someone help me or not, but i hope someone can at least try to explain it to me. i'm not the most technical person in the world, but i'm gonna try. thanx!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Somehow i don't think you're talking about AVS there. If you are please specify. Are you using winamp 2 or 3? (if 3 i <u>have</u> to recommend going back to 2, it really is that much better). you should go to either:<br />
      here for winamp 3: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=131" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/forumdispla...s=&amp;forumid=131</a><br />
      or here for winamp 2: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=11" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=11</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">try opening the video window! i dont think you will see a video in the AVS screen. or if the video is in .avi format, then try the AVS renderer</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think what is wrong is that you don't have the codecs required. I believe you are probably trying to watch divx video, and you need to download a divx component for it to play in winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">My excuses for posting here, but is it possible to import the DivX codec into the Winamp (3) Video player?<br />
