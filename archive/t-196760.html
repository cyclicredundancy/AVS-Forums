      <p class="post-content"><strong>Help on a Code for the SuperScope:</strong><br />
      I need some help on a good code for a good SuperScope. I will attempt to ask this question with ease though. If anyone has the knowledge to make a yin-yang sign out of a SuperScope, can you post it on here? I will of course give you a special thanks for it. I would have to figure out a bit more of what I want. So... if anyone feels up to giving me the code, put it down on here. Thank you.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you. And I was about to say something about it being created with more than one SuperScope, lol. And once I download it and see what it looks like, which I know it will be close and if I use it, I will give special thanks to you. Since you did make it. And it would be right for me to do so. Especially if I can find a way to make it look more advanced and then submit it on here. Then everyone will know that you created the yin-yang.<br />
      <br />
      Now... What would be a good way to make this move? Any ideas or suggestions? Put it up on here and I will, like I stated, give credit. Only if you made the codes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Better than what I can do Mr_Nudge, lol. Maybe someone will come in and help us out. We won't know until someone comes in and gives a helping hand.

      <p class="post-content">I'm still in year 10. I have only a small idea what all the maths does, i just try everything until something works. It means i can only make simple things, but as i learn more, i'll understand more, so i can make more complex scopes and stuff.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup. I should've done that too. Just I guess I don't have the patience. Plus if I look around this forum, I can probably find each term for each function for a SuperScope. But of course, you have a bit more experience than me. All I can do is drawing anime, haha. Thank you though. I appreciate for the help and I'm glad you did do that.</p>

      </blockquote>You can make it out of one superscope. Heck you could make a rotating solid enviroment mapped 3D ying yang out of 1 superscope.<br />
      <br />
      I suggest you get the AVS Programming Guide written by some cool guy whos name I can't remember. It has a nice guide to superscope coding... and it shows you how to make solid superscopes... and make them 3D. So get to work on your solid 3D ying-yang.

      <p class="post-content">Thank you. Actually... I'm at work on making a different AVS. I kind of made a flower... I think. I used some of the excisting movement codes for two and then used the 6-way kaleida as the third movement. On top of that, I used no SuperScopes. But in fact I used simply, I mean simply, two moving particles. Where the sizes change from small to big... So, I kind of messed around and made somewhat a flower that changes colors... and that such. I should post it on here though. If I can though. And let all of you see it... Those who come in here and view this post I mean. So that everyone can comment on it I guess.</p>

      <p class="post-content">My AVS I was talking about. I hope it doesn't look too bad. And if you want to see this in a very big way, which is best when used on a wide screen type modem for... I guess parties or whatever, make sure it is hanging a bit high on the wall. So that it will look better than you facing it with your face planted on the screen itself. And it is bad to plant your face right on the screen anyways, hahaha. I've also put a comment on there. And it is my original work. Simple but it looks like one of those 70's type AVS. Bla bla bla. That's about it for now. I hope you all like it... And I know that not all will like it. I know everyone has a different opinion about AVSs. Not all like the same thing and I understand that. Why most don't interest people and some other's do interest them. That's about it and sorry for this to be... a gigantic post. Feedback and comments are appreciated as well. As long as it doesn't deal with right out making fun of the AVS and me, I guess. I know people have the tendency to do this. I know... If it is a reasonable comment, then I will nod and understand why you post that sort of comment down. But other than that. If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything, haha. In our case, don't write anything.<br />

      <p class="post-content">No offense lord. But you use alot of words to say very few things.<br />
      <br />
      About your scope, you can make a solid yin-yang scope pretty easily. One way to make solid scopes is by using the code<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />::Frame::<br />a=0<br /><br />::pixel::<br />a=1-a;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      With a basic understanding of superscopes and math you should be able to figure out how that works.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thank you, heh. And I understand that. I tend to say too much that says very few things. Just think if I had to talk about all the things that's running through my head? Hahaha. It would be at least 8 pages long. But... that won't ever happen. Because in reality, I continously think and forget things. How my brain works. If it isn't important, I forgot. And if you're talking about my AVS, thank you very much, haha. I appreciate your compliment and all. I changed it a bit though. Added two more moving particles to it. Well... that's it for now and thank you for giving me some more codes. I have to copy and paste it to a notepad though. And I'll figure a place to put it at as well. And I will try and work with the formula when I have time too. And of course I will give special thanks to you. And also, it's quite hard to offend me to the point I cuss now. Because why do that? It isn't a good thing to do and risk everything. :D And it's your opinion too.</p>
