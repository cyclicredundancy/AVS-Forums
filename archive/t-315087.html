<div class="posttext">I'm looking for a couple of old presets. I believe that these would have been made or released prior to the end of 2004, if that helps. I'm pretty sure they were AVS presets, although I suppose there is a slim chance they could have been part of another engine - I seem to remember them in the AVS list, though.<br />
<br />
I've looked through the lists, but I didn't see anything, which leads me to think they were part of a pack.<br />
<br />
The first was a wire-frame spaceship that flew through a field of lightning bolts that went from the floor to the ceiling. The entire animation moved with the music, as did the ship and the bolts.<br />
<br />
The second was an animation that gave the effect of moving through a field of square passages - the animation would enter a large square area with smaller, square passages branching off in every direction. One would be chosen, the animation would go down it, and enter another square, and so on...<br />
<br />
I could have swore up and down I had these archived somewhere, but checking my backup disk didn't reveal anything other than the normal stuff Winamp used to get installed with.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, please? I'd like to find these, as they were some of the coolest presets I had. :igor: <br />
<br />
Many thanks!</div></div><hr />
