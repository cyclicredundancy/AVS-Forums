      </blockquote>Only happens when I try to load a new preset and this is using 2.81B &amp; 2.81D &amp; 2.9x<br />
      Wondering if there is any fix to this crashing and/or if a new avs is coming out to fix this :)<br />
      My pc specs+OS are Windows 7 ultimate, 2.8ghz pentium D dual-core running 2gb of ram, and winamp 5.61 ....any fix available (apart from downgrading would be much appreciated..)<br />
      As its 2am here I will going to bed now, easiest way to reach me would be on #avs and tyvm for any help :)

      <p class="post-content">5.61 ships with 2.81d as everyone complained about v2.83 being shipped. guess you can't win when it comes to that plug-in :( so no there's no fix and i wouldn't expect anything any time soon other than using 2.83 (of justin's v2.9 thing from last year though i've not tried it) which didn't seem to crash on Vista / Win7 but broke some presets *shrugs*<br />

      </blockquote>we gave you the options there are. another would be running an old version of winamp in windows xp mode (or vmware etc.), avs runs faster than you'd expect. the winamp devs, most notably DrO, tried to improve the situation after years of halted development. now all they get is complaints - not fair!<br />

      <p class="post-content">if you're using 2.81whatever then it will crash as that doesn't have the related fixes which 2.82 / 2.83 had which for most people resolves the crashes on Windows 7. however that still won't fix broken apes, other issues which have generally plagued AVS when trying to use it on newer OSes especially when UAC is involved. also you've only mentioned 2.81b/d &amp; justin's custom 2.9 but never 2.82/3 so for whatever reason you've not tried all available versions.<br />
      <br />
      people wanted 2.81d back, that was done and now that is fecking wrong. i am just so pissed off with the whole AVS scenario and it really should be removed from the distro and versions provided as standalone downloads from the site. and when i suggested that i got general 'meh' or 'no you cannot do that' responses though that is the only viable way to deal with a plug-in no one wants to work on / have the time to do so anymore.<br />
      <br />
      AVS hasn't been the default plug-in for years, no one else has really attempted to do any work on it and i don't have the time to waste trying to fix it anymore as paid job and gf &gt; AVS (or even my own plug-ins).<br />

        <b>* Reverted: Milkdrop from v2.23 to v2.2 and AVS from v2.83 to v2.81d (for now)</b>
      </blockquote>which is in the 5.61 changelog. so that's what "broke" in reverting to the older version people wanted as has been mentioned multiple times in this thread!<br />
