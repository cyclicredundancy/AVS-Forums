		Hi,<br />
<br />
if you like Trance music, full moon parties in Goa, the sun rise, and flying leaves, you should try my first AVS experiment.<br />
<br />
It's quite fast (10 fps in 640*480 with 1 GHz Pentium) as I avoided all effect lists with there time consuming rendering. Nevertheless its cycle is quite long: Trans/Dynamic Movement shows three different phases controlled by one parameter. The background changes after 80 and 240 sec significantly. It will return to the first design after 500 sec in total (depending on the beat. btw: Does the beat detection works well? The CD cover says 140 bpm, AVS just finds 70?).<br />
<br />
The objects (sun and leaves) are generated with Render/Superscope. It took hours to do the maths for the flying leaves. One problem was the limited space for the per-point-calculation. So don't expect 'speaking' names for the variables.<br />
<br />
Just try it. If you don't like it, don't blame me, just delete it (as I did with all the slow presets).<br />
<br />
CU in Goa<br />

		Well i like the superscopes, but the background is frankly quite bad. The dynamove isn't that great and the simple scopes don't fit with the superscopes or the background i think.<br />
I haven't seen any presets from you before, so if this was your first i got to give you a big round of applaud for the effort in the scopes :up:

		Yeah, hes right about the background man. You times scopes seem to work well, as does the leaf. Is the leaf yours?

		yep, I did the leaf.<br />
<br />
the sunrise starts at random. Also quite difficult to realise (or to reinvent?)<br />
<br />
concerning the background: maybe it's not nice from an asthetic point of view. But it's fast, and you won't get the impression that you have seen everything after 5 seconds. And: it's so hectic, it only fits to Trance/Techno!<br />
<br />
the background changes after 80 and 240 sec significantly. it will return to the first design after 500 sec in total.<br />
<br />
Feel free to copy leaves and sunrise and change the background. I'd like to see if u can get the same frame rate with other (changing) backgrounds.<br />
<br />
btw: Rendering a picture with palm trees and 'multiply rendering' gives u a better feeling of Goa. But it's soooo slow.
