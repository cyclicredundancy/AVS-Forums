      <p class="post-content"><strong>Faking a line</strong><br />
      In the attached preset, i created a rotating pencil that creates a line that slowly fades out. Nothing special, but since the pencil moves per frame and therefor skippes pixels, the line is just some pixels. Now is this preset om my pc fast enough to cover up this, but i can imagine that this won't be the case on a Pentium 133... Any ideas how to solve this?<br />
      <br />
      T2 (=Texer 2) is needed for the preset</p>

      <p class="post-content">First off, very creative idea for a preset. With some work this can be great.<br />
      <br />
      As far as the pencil line is concerned, a line superscope would actually accomplish this task better. I've attached an example of what I would do. This way you don't get any non-continuous dots. (At the beginning, a line is drawn from (0,0) to the pencil point, which shouldn't happen, but I'll let you fix that.)<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: If you have an AVS 2.7 pre version and the Set Line Width APE, the line thickness of the pencil line will vary depending on the Z value of the pencil line (how close it is to the camera).</p>

      </blockquote>Now you mention it, it would be great if T2 had some scaling option to accomplish that too, wouldn't it... :rolleyes: :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      And perhaps a built-in maxblend :cool:<br />
      <br />
      UCD, work is awaiting you... ;)

      <p class="post-content">Or Misc / Set render mode.<br />
      <br />
      Please read the docs next time. These are essential features of Texer 2.</p>

      <p class="post-content">gaekwad2: True. My fault.<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: Did read them, but until now, about every T2 I've seen was in maxblend mode, so I thougt a builtin maxblend would speed things up a bit 'cause you'll *probably* need some blending anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What do you mean with a 'builtin' max blend? Texer 2 does all the blending itself. Misc / Set render mode is just the mechanism of choosing the mode, nothing else.<br />
      <br />
      Don't talk about stuff you have no idea about please.</p>

      <p class="post-content">?? What do YOU mean by "blending itself"? There isn't any blending except for perhaps the colorfiltering.<br />
      To show what I mean, I've attached two presets.<br />
      You'll need blending anyway to get rid of black backgrounds(noblend.avs)<br />
      <br />
      What I meant is to be able to switch between blending modes, integrated within T2, as if it were "setrender+T2" in one.<br />
      This would be faster than two seperate components.<br />
      <br />
      I don't think that in the future the T2 bitmaps will stop being (mostly round)images in a square picture, so you will always need to blend the black away.</p>
