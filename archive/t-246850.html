      Can you attach the preset, so that we know what you've got so far?</p>

      </blockquote>you will find the preset in hynotised or neuromancer. as for the details or the preset itself i have none. just the fact i need a colororgan preset and i need help. the request that was given to me in person by the requestie was that he wanted a preset that will turn on specific circles set to a certain frequency. red being the highest and purple being the lowest. so far i cannot figure out the math to do this. *jealous of el-vis already* ack jheriko if you could please try your best. i'm not asking for complete help. but i need some assistence on the project. *whacks computer because it keeps crashing* hmm ok if i sounded a little retarded then sorry for that. anyway anyhelp will be apreciated. i just need a spectrum analysing engine to set the circles to.

      <p class="post-content">"Color organ" is the name of a little device that you can plug lights into so they'll respond to music. One light (or string of lights) responds to low frequencies, one responds to middle frequencies, and one responds to high frequencies.<br />
      <br />
      I know this because we have one in our living room, connected to our big stereo. It reaches from the floor to the ceiling and has a nice pattern of lights in a 3x16 grid. It really makes Duran Duran come alive!<br />
      <br />
      To emulate this in AVS, you should use the getspec() function, not getosc(). Click on the "Expression Help" button when you see it, then on the "Functions" tab, for information on how to use it. There should be enough there to help you get started with that function.<br />
      <br />
      For displaying the circles, I recommend a "Render / Texer II". The default image, a soft circle, would work rather well for this kind of effect.<br />
      <br />
      If I were to make a preset like this, I would probably use gmegabuf() trickery to make each light fade out slowly, and then light up again quickly once its part of the spectrum is above a certain threshold. With enough programming and math background, that effect should be rather simple to implement.<br />
      <br />
      (Now I actually want to try that.)<br />
      <br />
      You'll still need to experiment quite a bit to get anything close to what you want, but I hope this helps get you started in the right direction.</p>

      <p class="post-content">These ones aren't slow, they are a bit dull and empty, but its nice to see that you managed to accomplish what you wanted. I prefer the 2D one, its nice except for the random fogging... the 3D one just looks like a pile of particles with some random fog.<br />
      <br />
      Still lots of room for improvement tho, both of these presets could be made with one Texer II component for instance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">heh it was actualy easy when you know what works and what doesn't. in other words i test everything with regs and then i take what i want. mainly on things for sure tho if my timing is right i'll come up with my own 3d engine sooner or later and i will dump el-vis's.</p>
