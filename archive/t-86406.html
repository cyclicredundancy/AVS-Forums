      <p class="post-content">Hey, not so hasty, I couldn't get here for a few days.<br />
      <br />
      Technically, they're quite good. I found "bizzare" hard to look at what with all the flashing, but I liked "cryogenic" and "on my way to the cage".<br />
      <br />
      the growth in "crystal" was pretty neat, a good one to chill too (so was "ice" and "the garden"). Too bad you can't cycle colours with unique tone.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, I think some can use work. All are interesting, but some don't seem quite finished.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with Jaheckelsafar, alot of seem unfinished. I dont like all of them... They all seem to use the same basic effect. I liked the cage one, but the rest seem kind of boring and unoriginal.<br />
      <br />
      Nice concepts, could definetly use some work though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i suck at equations so making dynamic movements is pretty hard for me, I spent a few days a while back messing around with them but couldnt work out how to make them look decent. Most use the a similar dynamic movement that i made a while back with just tweaks to some of the beat detection etc.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, im not too good with the technical aspect of avs (im a skinner) so if you could point me in the direction of some sort of tutorial for superscopes and/or DM i'd really appreciate it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think they're quite good for a 1st pack, and you should publish them, just throw out bizzare unless you want someone to get an epileptic seizure.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I actually like bizzare at about 20fps fullscreen...Gives a strobe light effect. I might not publish that one as yeh, i can see how it might be 'irritating'..:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">atmo, good shit well, only if you have a good fps, the highest fps i got was (without the pixeldouble) is 6 fps<br />
      <br />
      tips:<br />
      sometimes you have to sacrifice "nice" for speed,<br />
      and keep the "treestructure" simple<br />

      and atmo i know that you are a skin reviewer, how do you like my newest skin, <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=317524" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=317524</a> ,the skinn is very blue<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hell yeah! Although most of them use the basic wobbler effect, the writing is quite good. 4.5 stars</p>

      </blockquote>Yes you can!<br />
      <br />
      Make an effect list<br />
      Put a SSC in it<br />
      Set it to "dots", n=1, and x=0;y=0;<br />
      Put a movement "d=0"<br />
      Set effect list to "multiply blend"<br />
      <br />
      The coloring will be filtered somewhat like unique tone, the SSC sets the color, and it doesn't work w/ white =(<br />
      <br />
      About the pack :<br />
      <br />
      Taken from a view of a viewer, no code checking :<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      "Warp Mist" - Quite nice... One of the better monotonic presets that I saw.<br />
      <br />
      "Welcome to the sun2" - Wobbly... somewhat nice, but I can't see much of things...<br />
      <br />
      "wobble"- Back and forth and back and... Anyway, nice coloring...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Taken from a view of a viewer, w/ code checking :<br />
      <br />
      "Warp Mist" - Nice view, and the coding is somewhat simple...<br />
      <br />
      "welcome to the sun2" - Hmm, I think the wobble effect can be recreated using "d", not separately "x" and "y"...<br />
      <br />
      "wobble" - Good use of effect lists! good contrast of colors! Wait a sec... is that the wobble effect that I just saw in the previous preset?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ____<br />
      <br />
      Ok, that's for the detailed review - takes too much time...<br />
      <br />
      Overall : 3.5-4 stars...<br />
      <br />
      Completeness : 2.5-3.5 stars...<br />
      Aesthetics : 3.5-4.5 stars...<br />
      I forgot the other one =p<br />
      <br />
      They are nice, but they seem like things repeated all over again (Ice and Crystal pretty much the same, etc)<br />
      <br />
      "Bizarre" - Hurts my eyes...
