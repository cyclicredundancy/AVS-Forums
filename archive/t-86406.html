<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey, not so hasty, I couldn't get here for a few days.<br />
<br />
Technically, they're quite good. I found &quot;bizzare&quot; hard to look at what with all the flashing, but I liked &quot;cryogenic&quot; and &quot;on my way to the cage&quot;.<br />
<br />
the growth in &quot;crystal&quot; was pretty neat, a good one to chill too (so was &quot;ice&quot; and &quot;the garden&quot;). Too bad you can't cycle colours with unique tone.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think some can use work. All are interesting, but some don't seem quite finished.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree with Jaheckelsafar, alot of seem unfinished. I dont like all of them... They all seem to use the same basic effect. I liked the cage one, but the rest seem kind of boring and unoriginal. <br />
<br />
Nice concepts, could definetly use some work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Atmo</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th May 2002, 09:31</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Well i suck at equations so making dynamic movements is pretty hard for me, I spent a few days a while back messing around with them but couldnt work out how to make them look decent. Most use the a similar dynamic movement that i made a while back with just tweaks to some of the beat detection etc.<br />
<br />
Anyways, im not too good with the technical aspect of avs (im a skinner) so if you could point me in the direction of some sort of tutorial for superscopes and/or DM i'd really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think they're quite good for a 1st pack, and you should publish them, just throw out bizzare unless you want someone to get an epileptic seizure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I actually like bizzare at about 20fps fullscreen...Gives a strobe light effect. I might not publish that one as yeh, i can see how it might be 'irritating'..:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">atmo, good shit well, only if you have a good fps, the highest fps i got was (without the pixeldouble) is 6 fps<br />
<br />
tips: <br />
sometimes you have to sacrifice &quot;nice&quot; for speed,<br />
and keep the &quot;treestructure&quot; simple<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Check out question 6 in the FAQ. It has links to threads that deal with DMs and Superscopes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hell yeah!  Although most of them use the basic wobbler effect, the writing is quite good.  4.5 stars</div></div><hr />

Too bad you can't cycle colours with unique tone.<br />
<br />
Yes you can!<br />
<br />
Make an effect list<br />
Put a SSC in it<br />
Set it to &quot;dots&quot;, n=1, and x=0;y=0;<br />
Put a movement &quot;d=0&quot;<br />
Set effect list to &quot;multiply blend&quot;<br />
<br />
The coloring will be filtered somewhat like unique tone, the SSC sets the color, and it doesn't work w/ white =(<br />
<br />
About the pack :<br />
<br />
Taken from a view of a viewer, no code checking :<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Warp Mist&quot; - Quite nice... One of the better monotonic presets that I saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the sun2&quot; - Wobbly... somewhat nice, but I can't see much of things...<br />
<br />
&quot;wobble&quot;- Back and forth and back and... Anyway, nice coloring...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Taken from a view of a viewer, w/ code checking :<br />
<br />
&quot;Warp Mist&quot; - Nice view, and the coding is somewhat simple...<br />
<br />
&quot;welcome to the sun2&quot; - Hmm, I think the wobble effect can be recreated using &quot;d&quot;, not separately &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;...<br />
<br />
&quot;wobble&quot; - Good use of effect lists! good contrast of colors! Wait a sec... is that the wobble effect that I just saw in the previous preset?<br />
<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
Ok, that's for the detailed review - takes too much time...<br />
<br />
Overall : 3.5-4 stars...<br />
<br />
Completeness : 2.5-3.5 stars...<br />
Aesthetics : 3.5-4.5 stars...<br />
I forgot the other one =p<br />
<br />
They are nice, but they seem like things repeated all over again (Ice and Crystal pretty much the same, etc)<br />
<br />
&quot;Bizarre&quot; - Hurts my eyes...</div></div><hr />
