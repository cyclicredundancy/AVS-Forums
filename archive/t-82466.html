<div class="posttext">greatwho, you have defently learned some, <br />
i'll give you a little tip,<br />
<br />
you sometimes write <br />
<br />
variabel=(-1)*variabel <br />
this is right but there is a smarter way<br />
variabel=-variabel<br />
<br />
<br />
another tip is a simple thing that i figured out after doing it on my calcutator<br />
<br />
frame<br />
t=t+.1 // t is increasing with 0.1 for every frame<br />
<br />
pixel<br />
x=x+sin(t) <br />
when the variable t is sin:ed it's value goes between -1 &amp; 1, <br />
so what i done is to add the sin(t) with x and <br />
now the the objects goes back and forwards on the screen<br />
 <br />
<br />
p.s. i'm terrible @ explaining so i'm sending a preset that explains it better</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ooh...<br />
<br />
Good job... Good job...<br />
<br />
From the AVS Screen alone, they seem complicated...<br />
<br />
But there's one certain little thing you need to work on :<br />
<br />
Try to attract viewers, not give them something they would call, um, uh, &quot;boring&quot;...<br />
Otherwise, good job - though not exactly eye candy :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
P.S. : One of the presets is a nice eye candy. Hopefully, you can figure out which one is it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Generally not the type of DM I like. They do show an understanding of DMs and the math required to use them though. :)<br />
<br />
I tend to like swirly stuff that shows a lot of movement. Little movement (sp?) and linear movement do much for me. They aren't as absorbing.<br />
<br />
So :up: for understanding, :down: 'cause it's not my style.</div></div><hr />
