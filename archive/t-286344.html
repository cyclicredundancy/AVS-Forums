<div class="posttext">I've noticed this myself.<br />
Maybe its time for a new gallery server to be made. *notes this will prolly never happen* lol<br />
well it was a thought.<br />
<br />
then again. would 10 gigs of space and php,perl and Mysql be sufficient to start something like this?.<br />
cause if it is i'll manage it. and everyone can port their stuff ot it and we can all say screw you DA. XD</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I need to reupload a ton of stuff... shame I am so bloody lazy.<br />
<br />
Starting our own site won't fix the problem... as much as it would be fun, da has the massive exposure that our own website would lack.<br />
<br />
atm, trying to download my packs mostly breaks... which is quite annoying, especially since I don't have most of the original files anymore to resubmit many of the smaller releases and I have already resubmitted the main packs once... deeply frustrating.<br />
<br />
They could just not lose their data... how hard is it? I'm nobody and I /don't/ use backups and I still have managed to maintain almost all of my important data over the past 8 years.<br />
<br />
I've lost 3 sources I cared about to the void in that time... and a very small number of mp3s (~25 or so) through my own stupidity, but every mp3 or avi or savegame I have ever wanted to keep is still on a usable hard drive.</div></div><hr />
