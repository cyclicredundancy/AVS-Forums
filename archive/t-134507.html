<div class="posttext">It's about time i started playing with convultion filter and colour map a little more. On a big complex DM inspired by UnConeD and some squares and there we have it. Lets have some nice comments please :D</div></div><hr />

I must say, that's the most complex colormap I've ever seen!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I liked it better without the colourmap. I'm not a huge fan of insanely colourful presets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">not bad at all! I DO like th colour map, just not those colours.<br />
try to use 'methodic' colours, like ones that actually go together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ahh you can all go to hell i love those colours :p if you want some better colours disable the last effect list. Theres some &quot;better&quot; colours for you but i still prefer it the way it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There's definetly some weird alien shit flowing around there... :igor:<br />
<br />
Hehe, nice work with the colormap :up: But the problem here is i assume that it requires a pretty high resolution to look even somewhat good... Also are all those convolution's and fast brite's (which you could replace with the multiplier fyi.) really necessary? I think it needs a shitload more optimazation work on the trans effects, but i think this could turn out a great preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Weird. Just weird ;) I agree with Tuggummi, with a little more work this one could really kick ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">actually, if you get rid of that last effect list, the colors go together very well - the opposites are great imo...but with the last effect list it's a lot slower and not that much better.<br />
as for the convo before your colormap, i must ask...wtf were you smoking?  balance it with more powers of two, and make sure the bias is a power of two.  i sped it up in two seconds by changing the 10 to a 1 and adding a 4 in the middle.<br />
if you get rid of that convo and add a different, stable blurring filter it gets a LOT faster.  also, a small blur like this:<br />
111<br />
101<br />
111<br />
looks a lot better in place of the big fat greasy one imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">weird shit :igor: But...Raz i think you have at least 15 Ã¼ber presets so what are you waiting for ? Enter winamp start avs fullscreen PRINT SCREEN then upload the pack :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm really really busy so i've just got enough time to psot this. Got to do 7 art study sheets, paint two art projets and do 1/5 of the entire 2 year I.T course in 7 hours. I'll put some work in on the preset tomorrow. Phaze, i'm too busy lately so avs has been an on/off thing when i get the time so i can't really do many presets. I don't have that much finished. I'll release when it's ready, probably in about 5 or 6 weeks because i finish exams in about 3 or 4 weeks, then i'll have time to make new stuff and perfetc it. For now i've got to go work, enjoy your freedom y'all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">When using convolution, use powers of two as much as you can, especially for the division factor.<br />
<br />
Also you can get fast, stable blurring convolutions differently. The one Atero posted is not bad, but here's a trick I discovered a while ago. If you use a kernel like this:<br />
<br />
0 1 0 0 0<br />
0 0 0 0 1<br />
0 0 0 0 0<br />
1 0 0 0 0<br />
0 0 0 1 0<br />
<br />
You get a fast blur that doesn't tend towards the x or y axis. One of these will still introduce a major visible distortion though, so follow it with another one, but this time mirrored.<br />
You can also make a larger 7x7 version of it (same shape, first row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 for example) and put the 7x7 first followed by a mirrored 5x5.<br />
Very fast, high radius and few noticable edges.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this is one great preset. nevermind the color-criticism in this threat, that's all about taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">huh, that's the weirdest preset I've seen awhile. I like the chrome color in there but the color map is IMO just too f*cked up, try to decrease the amount of those colors and it's going to be great :) ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">...i REALLY liked the first version (minus the last el) better :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th May 2003, 11:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's basically what it is, but with the colour map optimised and a slight brightness. There's just no pleasing some people is there :p I know what the difference is though. The first one -EL has three colours and chrome and the second has two. I liked the opposite two colour schemes better than the three that were just random. The convultion filter has to be on 0 in the middle and on 10 where you said to change it to optimise it and i just like the other one better. If you like it that much more then watch that one instead ;)</div></div><hr />
