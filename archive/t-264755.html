		I'm quite proud of them, even if I know they are all so basic I should be ashamed... <br />
anyway... I still don't really know how this AVS works for those that make this seriously funky stuff,  all I know: one day I will know!<br />
<br />
enough txt, enjoy my presets.<br />
after all, there is only a few.<br />
<br />
all the best boys and girls<br />
<br />
wiola p.<br />
<br />
p.s. all feedback welcome

		Hello,<br />
<br />
Firstly they all run like pretty slow on my pc (only funkyspiral got over 20fps at 320x240 on my 800mhz piece of crap) so they may look much better on a faster system...<br />
Although I think you should be able to optimize most of them to run better.<br />
Taking funkyspiral as an example, if you take everything out the effects list, then delete it, and move the channel shift to the bottom of the list then the colour shift will actually affect the output and you will also get a higher frame rate, as effects lists eat fps.<br />
<br />
I also noticed one or two more presets had effects placed in them that weren't doing any thing or were duplicates (Like the two fadeouts in Sun, trash one of them and just fiddle with the slider on the other one) <br />
<br />
Your choice of colours is quite nice throughout the presets, the only dodgy thing is the grey background on kol.<br />
The layering in starwars is also quite nice too.<br />
<br />
As you said some of them aren't that great, but don't worry about that.<br />
All you need to do is practise and learn how to code in AVS, then you'll be able to create presets that can respond to music better.

		funny enough, I am staying in Bristol now:)<br />
<br />
I know I'm not the best coder, but still it's all powerful. btw optimizing the fps was the last thing I was thinking about so maybe it'a about time to start:)<br />
<br />
thanks for those comments, I appreciate that somebody finds a minute!

		I had some fun with your mos preset.<br />
Heres the results.<br />
p.s. i did some of QOAL's suggestions about the el's<br />
sadly he's right.<br />
you use the effect lists to much and that causes major consumption on the fps.<br />
also i will give you some helpful advice.<br />
when zooming with a dynamove you do not need a grid size and same goes for rotation.<br />
also checkout the sscs in this remix and you might learn something. ;) :) ;)

		mos seems to be pretty good. I like it. But I'd have to agree with QOAL, some do run quite slow. I normaly get 32-64 fps but with clock, I got 9.5! Optimizing is defenetly something to consider. Pretty good job, though.
