      Who do YOU think should be the new mod to the AVS forums? If you don't see their name on the list, post your vote. If you would like to run for office, please say so ;)<br />
      *I left UnConeD's name off the list because of reasons stated in the "New mods needed?" thread.</p>

      I don't think Rova will allow another mod - its the general impression I got.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry atero but i agree with legohead. You may be knowledgable and respected but you have a short temper and it may result in unecessary bannings or flame wars from mods. Mods don't flame, they say, "flame again, and you're gone". Also i agree that although we are having this poll, i don't think Rovastar will mod anyone. Your third point i had already pointed out in an earlier post.<br />
      <br />
      Atero, you shouldn't be an ass to anyone regardless of whether they're moronic or not. If they are simply point it out and correct them or ignore it.</p>

      </blockquote>That's a less severe form of flaming right there. There is guilt on both sides. Just because he says something to you doesn't mean that you have to say something back. Let him get in trouble - I think it will be coming soon anyways.

      <p class="post-content">No, I didn't say anything bad about him. I am merely referring to the fact that he could be getting in trouble if he continues to make remarks like he has been.

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, but that could be somewhat related to there not being an active mod watching this forum(for the last few weeks, at least). I've noticed a lot of things being said that I don't think Rovastar or the other mod's would tolerate without saying something.</p>

      Being a moderator is indeed great responsibility, but they still don't get paid. I just don't understand where that idea of payment comes from. Being a mod is a job you have to do with care and requires constant activity, but still you gotta admit that everybody else looks up to you also :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't think they'll care at the end of the day. Besides two users may share the same default gateway IP. i.e. Atero may not be signing up to vote for himself - it may be someone on the same broadband network (this is by the way an example - I don't need another name calling tantrum).<br />
      The best way is to simply allow people to list thier names in the forum - and perhaps make them eligable to vote from a predefined criteria.</p>

      If it were a time question i would beat atero, because i have registered earlier than he is. But it's not a time question and Anubis has proven in a very short time that he is devoted, knows a lot, is friendly and can control his temper *cough*<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, but that many posts does mean that I have spent a lot of time on these forums. What other sort of experience is there besides time spent doing something? Sure I haven't spent as much time on here as Atero, but I have spent more time than a lot of people on here. I know the inner workings of these forums(including a good idea of what it's like to be a mod - I am a mod of another forum that is run with the same basic setup), and know what the responsibilities are. And I wasn't trying to postpump - just defend myself, since I do think that I have all the needed experience to be a moderator of these forums, just as basically all of the regulars do.<br />

      <p class="post-content">People<br />
      Just because there's only one mod designated to a specific forum, doesn't mean that we aren't all watching ;)<br />
      The "moderated by" column is merely an age-old traditional formality.<br />
      We were actually considering scrapping it at one point.<br />
      <br />
      Some of the more specialist forums (eg. avs, milkdrop, nsis, developer) <i>usually</i> require less moderating than the more public/general forums (Tech Support, GD, Bitchlist, Breaking Wind, etc).<br />
      We expect the regulars to behave in a more mature and professional manner.<br />
      But from time to time, situations do arise . . .<br />
      Hey, anyone remember when a huge flame war broke out between WA2 Skins forum and GD regulars, over the stupid motm polls? The Skin Love forum was renowned at the time for being one of the most trouble-free forums (and thankfully, still is), but some of the members got totally carried away on that occasion. This required a heavy bout of moderating to resolve and restore the peace.<br />
      <br />
      There are currently 26 active mods on the forums.<br />
      Some mods already believe this to be waaay too much.<br />
      If and when some of the mods leave (due to whatever reason) and the rest of the mods deem it necessary to instate new mods, then so be it. But at the moment, we don't feel it necessary. Sorry.<br />
      <br />
      However, most of the mods are constantly on the lookout for <i>talent</i>, and if we do deem someone potentially worthy, we will start a relevant "yay or nay" thread backstage.<br />
      Noted traits range from:<br />
      communication skills<br />
      dedication and willingness to help<br />
      specialized knowledge (be it in tech support, skins, avs, shoutcast, whatever)<br />
      and general <i>je ne sais quoi</i><br />
      <br />
      If a flame war breaks out in one of the specialist subforums, and it escapes the mods' attention, then we would normally expect one of the regulars to bring it to our attention. (just pm one or more of the mods listed as "currently online").<br />
      <br />
      Like I said, someone is ALWAYS watching.<br />
      We have discussed this matter backstage, and a few mods have pledged to keep an extra eye on this place, whenever humanly possible.<br />
      <br />
      Your views have been noted.<br />
      <br />
      Please keep the peace.<br />
      <br />
      Have fun<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      If you'll read the thread entitled 'Muwahahaha*cough*hahaha* by d0rk, you'll understand the plight of the GD. Will the new Mod elected here be instated as a new GD mod to help 'clean it up' or just another general mod? IMO, only the GD really needs a new mod at this point.</p>

      </blockquote>I agree with you. The thing is that i'm overloeded with activities that i like: VJ'ing, avsing, programing, organizing Trance Parties, creating blacklight decorations and even more.<br />
      <br />
      Obviously, most won't get the time that it deserves to make any progress above average.<br />
      <br />
      I try to stick exclusively to one thing when its necesary - actually programming Hotlist 2.2<br />
      <br />
      But the time will come when AVS will be more important, i already planned to work though your Primer - maybe there's something usefull.<br />
      <br />
      At least i got a detailed view on how AVS for VJ'ing should be like. Although most of you all do neat presets, they're mostly too slow IMO. If yo're having a great Party and there are 100 peopel crowding on a floor just about to go crazy @ 145 BPM you need to push them even highter with flashy hyperactive Presets :D<br />
      <br />
      Back to topic, i always enjoy you having one of your "I'll eat this n00b" days, hoping he won't take it too personal.

      <p class="post-content">1. I don't know anything about AVSing. It was this thread that initiated a chain of events that led to me being asked to mod here. So if any of you still wants to see this forum helping new users, I'm willing to learn but could use some direction as to where to start. Atero's primer seems to be a good place, any others?<br />
      <br />
      2. I am doing my homework by reading old threads before committing myself to any actions at all in this forum, that is why you have yet to see a post by me. Do you want an informed mod or an idiot who "bans first, asks questions later?<br />
      <br />
      Now for the bad stuff:<br />
      Flaming noobs is unacceptable. If a person doesn't know where to look, and asks a question that has been answered a hundred times before either: A)Ignore it, B)Link to the answered question, or C)Answer it again. I don't care what your previous status in this or any other forum may have been. The winamp forums rules contain specific guidelines concerning flaming, and many posts by many people in this and other threads in the AVS forums either bend or break that rule. Inciting flames is equal to flaming with regards to forum policy. I will not edit, move, lock, or delete any past posts, but be warned that in the future your post may be edited or deleted if it contains inflammatory material. This is a technical support forum, not a free speech/human rights forum. If someone is getting in the way of someone else getting technical support I feel justified in removing them.<br />
      <br />
      I also hope that I do not need to take such measures. I don't enjoy silencing people, even ones I disagree with or dislike. I want to see more AVS presets doing more interesting things and that's why I accepted the additional role of avs moderator.<br />
      <br />
      If anyone wants to discuss anything more with me about my role and intentions here, feel free to PM me.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Atero's primer is good but it has major gaps and problems. He's promised an update but nothing has been spoken of it for a while. The best thing to do is do what you're doing and search through old threads to learn.<br />
      <br />
      The flaming is mainly just over the same old question asked at least once a week by one noob or another. "how do i stop avs from changing" or "how do i make avs" usually irritates all the regulars because we see it every other week. Atero is "teh n00binator" of the forum, he has been advised to cool it off many times but i have never even seen any suggestion to cool down from any mod.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe things will be better this way, i certainly hope so. Glad to have a dedicated mod Gonzo. By the way Rova this isn't putting down your modding ability, we realise you put a valued contribution into the forums we just needed a mod who participates in threads and is dedicated to avs and can give a well deserved "kick in the head" when necessary.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, instead of resenting it (or me), or at least in spite of it, you could let me know what you'd think would benefit these forums. Another mod is not the answer. Throwing more fuel at a fire doesn't put it out. I rarely need to invoke any moderator functions in order to do my job as a moderator. Mostly it involves helping people to get the information they need and to get along with one another.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      [Edit]Michael, If it's clearly present in the faq, then a link to it is the easiest way to deal with it on a daily basis. If you can link to other important information, you can not even add a personal message. A lot of mods and other helpful users I know in wa3 and wa2 tech support use text documents with preformatted vbb links and information to make it easier on themselves. Once you set up the list of links, it gets to be faster and simpler to cut and paste then to think of a personalized reply to every silly noob. Not to mention my theory that once they've gotten the impression that this forum is full of professionals, they're be more inclined to act like one themeselves.[/edit]<br />

      You people are starting flame wars against newbies/each oother are the same that want new mods. Stop starting flame wars to get a new mod.<br />
      <br />
      Sadly I do not trust (m)any of you enough to become mods. Lead by example.<br />
      <br />
      The suggestion at ATero be a mod when IMHO he is one of teh biggest culpirts of the flaming (which is what this is a lot about) is crazy.<br />
      <br />
      The most simple solution is to ban a few of you and the forums would be a much nicer place. DO you really want that?!?!<br />
      <br />
      Each each other to calm down the flaming.<br />
      <br />
      As for a mod not telling people to stop flaming it is all the f*cking seem to do here.<br />
      <br />
      I am getting pissed off with this and will start banging heads soon.</p>
