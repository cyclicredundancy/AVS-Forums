<div class="posttext">I have a problem with my AVS.  When I go from Window to Fullscreen and back to Window, I get a large, noticable black bar on the right side of my AVS window.  It is depicted in the attachments, where 1 is the window before fullscreen and 2 is after fullscreen.<br />
<br />
On second thought, I cannot attach the pictures.  Does anybody have a host I can put these on so that people can see my problem?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, I get that bug too sometimes. The easiest way to fix it is to close your AVS window and open it again, that always works for me. I think that it has something to do with the resolution change.<br />
<br />
Why can't you attach the pictures? Try saving them as .jpg and attaching them.<br />
<br />
Also, doesn't this really belong in a bug report forum or something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can't post the images here because of size.<br />
<br />
also, I do not think that belonged here anyway but It may need to get the trip to the bug report forum...:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Did you actually read my post??<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't post the images here because of size.<br />
<br />
<br />
Use .jpg, unless your window is massive (like 1600x1200) that will go down smaller than 105Kb. I have several wallpapers which are at 800x600 and bigger which are smaller than 105Kb, some of them are at 1280x1024.<br />
<br />
<br />
also, I do not think that belonged here anyway but It may need to get the trip to the bug report forum...<br />
<br />
<br />
Well done for repeating what I said.</div></div><hr />
