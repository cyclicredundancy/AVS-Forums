      It's been a while for me, and usualy when i make presets its out of boredom and curosity of 'hey i wonder how this will be like'<br />
      <br />
      but in most cases i sometimes lose em, or things get moved about<br />
      <br />
      *shrugs*<br />
      <br />
      so i got a few<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      enjoy.<br />
      <br />
      Scarface, teh Blurpak makeh ^_^<br />
      <br />
      (notes 'just a little bitty' i made that on winamp 2.91 with a different version of colormap, so if you got that other version on that winamp (suddjesting that if you still use it) try that cus the wa5 version looks darker to me)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Blarg! - A bit too bright for me, like the use of that bitmap though<br />
      Just a little bitty - the movement is cool, but it would look better if you created it so, that the edges would either melt to eachother (left to right, up/down was done okay) or keep the edges free from color to prevent the ugly lines when wrapping.<br />
      Scarface blur revised (again) - Dunno, it's kinda static... Perhaps you could make 't' in the DM vary a bit more..<br />
      <br />
      Keep up the good work!<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I really like your sig :D<br />
      And oh, yeah, take a look at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=149939" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

      <p class="post-content">static was my very first best preset (i'll email it if you want)<br />
      <br />
      i donno i like playing with it every now and then<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Blur, that was a nice one that i made also a logn while ago, i thoguht that the bump was cool<br />
      <br />
      but then i added the DM this time and make it move in and out, but then was the centre of the rings, and it jsut looked empty<br />
      <br />
      Blarg, yeah i know its bright, but that can be fixed with decreasing the about of of 'bumppyness' in each of the bumps<br />
      <br />
      Little bitty, to be perfectly honest, I liked the lines there<br />
      also i used the same colormap that i used in blarg as well, so that helped on the effects too</p>
