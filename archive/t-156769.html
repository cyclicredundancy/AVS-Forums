      <p class="post-content">Here is a review of your presets:<br />
      <br />
      Checkerballs - N00bish and kinda ugly.<br />
      <br />
      Dot Derets - Repetitive, Boring, but not terribly n00bish. You used a few pieces of code.<br />
      <br />
      DoubleDosageDisco - N00bish and boring.<br />
      <br />
      double-dosage-disko-trippymix - Same as above but ugly.<br />
      <br />
      glidersnatch - Ugly.<br />
      <br />
      goldenrodsx2 - Boring and apart from the movement, n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      IDiedangonetohell - Quite n00bish and ugly.<br />
      <br />
      Ivediedandgonetoheaven - Same as above.<br />
      <br />
      Jerygs - N00bish.<br />
      <br />
      Jigglypuffinxv5 - N00bish and ugly.<br />
      <br />
      MerryXmasRMX - Less n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      midnightgems - Not very nice looking and not very music responsive.<br />
      <br />
      newwierdness - Yes it is wierd. But n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      Osostar - Not very interesting. The DDM looks similar to the default one.<br />
      <br />
      purplebars3 - Boring and n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      astralflowers - Boring. N00bish.<br />
      <br />
      These were all n00bish. Some were ugly. Try Some Superscopes and DM's. Some of the presets needed more music response.</p>

      Glad of the response I'm sure you all get overwhelmed with presets from every Tom, Dick, and Harry, Hi! I'm Harry..but anyway now that I've got some familiarity with how movements work I'm going to start work on superscopes, Plenty of info here, now if I can find the time..<br />

      <br />
      P.s. what's the census,are they n00b because of how they look or how there constructed?<br />
      <br />
      P.p.s "The only bad presets are the one's watched listening to bad music...." heard it on a thread, liked the idea..:hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">They look nOObish because they look like the stuff most people come up with when they first try making presets. Which wouldn't be a problem but there are just sooo many of them around. It would take an absolute fucking genius to make something new just using the standard effects.<br />
      But keep it up, keep reading them threads and you'll pick up some skills sooner than you think! :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, yes, they aren't the best like rest of the best, some people might tell you to give it a rest but when you learn from the best you become like the rest.<br />
      <br />
      in other words - you can figure out avs by checking out piR's tutorial, reading atero's primer, the FAQ, and sometimes by just taking a dive into the inner workings of other people's presets.<br />
      <br />
      btw hungryskull - I love your reviews :p</p>
