Shock Value 2003<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
This will be released on Winamp and DevArt, but for now I am &quot;test releasing&quot; it here. The pack contains updated versions of presets from &quot;As Seen On TV&quot; because that pack was never released except on these forums. Also, for the three of you who made remixes, post if you want me to change their names for the final release.<br />
<br />
APES would not fit into this post but you probably have them all (except for AddBorders, which was included):<br />
<br />
Convolution Filter<br />
Color Map<br />
Multiplier<br />
Color Shift<br />
Texer<br />
AddBorders<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
(crosses fingers that installer works)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I knew I forgot something... add this to your AVS directory. It's the image that's supposed to be displayed in the intro preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I hate to resort to bumping, but I was expecting more of a response than that. It would help me greatly to know if the installer is working correctly on all systems (it uses a modified version of the one jheriko posted).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 20:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Please fix the installer, it didn't autodetect my winamp2 dir. And also specify which directory you want the user to choose if it wasn't detected... I selected my AVS dir and got plugins\avs\plugins\avs.<br />
<br />
Oh and save your BMPs as RLE encoded paletted, it saves tons of space if it contains lots of solid areas, like your intro pic.<br />
<br />
But anyway... Schweet!<br />
- blast<br />
- nonsolidas: though you should stick to one style op colormap. I like map1, 3, 5, 7, 8<br />
- iridescent river: the original wasn't as pretty, the sky is cool<br />
- claustrophobia: the original was cool, but this rocks!. though it should move more constantly... a while up, a while down, a while stopped, ... makes it feel more natural<br />
- chrome current: amazing 2D preset, this would've won the flow contest if it satisfied the rules<br />
- blueprint: the vertical connections are awesome<br />
- einstein on drugs: nice, but I think it looks nicer with a solid white background<br />
- football weather: nice, the 'ball' is nice, but it's too dark for my taste. also, it seems quite complex, I'm sure you could optimize this some more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The videocard preset would kick ass if you could add synched scopes for the slot and connectors tho ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">sorry..<br />
i downloaded it but for some reason i didnt say anything.<br />
slack i guess.<br />
<br />
OK:<br />
the effect with the image in the intro is VERY cool..<br />
the actual preset is a bit plain, and the colors dont suit sometimes. But its a nice intro feel.<br />
<br />
Blast is extreamely cool.Very nice look, nice colors.<br />
<br />
ASOTV: nice wall effect, the numbers dont do much for me. bit boring.<br />
Warzone: very cool dm.<br />
<br />
warzone would be better with a different effect (not water)<br />
<br />
ROAD: Yeah, whoo!, i really like this. Reminds me of some of your first presets (like footbal weather, which is one of my faves)<br />
Would be nice if the camera was more reactive. The remix is ok, but the headlights are pretty gay (im not sure whos they are, so i dont know who im offending by saying that). The fog or lights in the distance looks really cool.<br />
<br />
Vivid Flowers: Didnt like this much, but its a good job scoping if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Nonsolidass: i dunno.. its pretty cool, but a bit weird, and it doesnt seem to react as well as it could. The colors of the thing kick arse.<br />
<br />
Wormhole: Yeay! really nice.. whoop whop whoop<br />
<br />
Vegas: doesnt wrap properly: the distance is all blocky<br />
<br />
Morals: Very cool earth. Well done there. Its a bit plain how it is though<br />
<br />
River: Yeay, this is wickid! Straight into my favs folder, actually its been there since i first saw the orignal version of this preset. this version is faster and looks alot cooler.<br />
<br />
System crash isnt spectacular<br />
<br />
Marker: Nice work, the scope is interesting, but the background is really really nice. those spirals also add alot.<br />
<br />
Claustrophobia: well, this is just getting more and more interesting. I really like unconed version (slash hack of his own wolfAVSein preset). It reminds me of that a starwars game i used top have.<br />
<br />
Afternoon refreshments is REALLY cool. You uhave achieved the effect very very well. They look so icey. im not sure why no one had commented yet, this whole pack is just awesome!<br />
<br />
MIANI: WTF??? yaeh, it is a bit boring.. i havnt seen that movie in years.<br />
<br />
PYRO: yeah, well done again..could be a bit faster tho. Remix is also wickid.<br />
<br />
Video card: niceone..  looks really cool. (late in the pack, my comments get shorter)<br />
<br />
I dunno about that neurons one.. too weird.. and they dont actualy seem to do much, just sit there.<br />
<br />
Beach: I dont think you needed to put that scope in, it looks really good without it. <br />
<br />
Puddle: nice effect,. nice colors..<br />
<br />
Chrome: well, you know what we think of this one, hense you winning (well not yet) the flow competition with it.<br />
<br />
Inverted: interesting idea. A good example of a nice simple preset, but extreamly nice to watch.<br />
<br />
Migrain: whoa, tame it up a bit boy.. i guess that phychadelica is the aim her, but i dont like it much.<br />
<br />
Blueprint: singnificantly improved upon, the focus scope looks much nmore realistic now. Maybe you should move the entire thing back on the x and z axes,  (as well as the top down view in the top left, so that it rotates around the center, and not a corner.<br />
<br />
Einstein: HAHA! this is great. I was going to do something very smilar to this.. Im not sure what anyone thinks, but id prefer it if the camera always stayed above the plane.<br />
<br />
Football weather: Well, the original has got to be my fav preset that youv ever done (maybe not the best, but its just got a mood about it).<br />
This version is very very clever, and will probably appeal to alot more people than the first one, but i don like it as much because its nolonger slow and atmosphereic. Very clever camera techniques, synching with the scope. When you get a decent series of beats in a row, the ball jumps up into the sky, :up:<br />
<br />
Geez, that was a fucking review and a hal;f..<br />
<br />
im so tired.. its 5:07 am here, and i havnt slept.<br />
<br />
im sorry for not reviewing ths earlyer. im just slack.<br />
<br />
All up, youve got a master of a pack here, should introduce you as one of the best AVS'ers around. All presets have a good aewsthetic finish too them. If i were you, ide change the intro, because it doesnt give a very good impression of how ghood the rest of the pack is. <br />
<br />
I like the fact you have improved dramitically on your older presets, but i think maybe you should actually state that they are already rleased, and that the originals are different. <br />
<br />
Arghhh.. i wish i had your ideas.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It is beautiful. Nice job Shock Value.<br />
<br />
Intro-Nice looking, but not the greatest colors, I am also thinking   you made this going more with the Pixels theme<br />
Blast- Pretty colors<br />
Microscopic Warzone- Not very interesting<br />
A Long Road Ahead/UnConeD RMX- I like the original a lot, good colors, FPS, and the overall effect, but I think the RMX just has to much stuff in it<br />
Vivid Flowers-Didn't like it the first time, but it doea have good scopes<br />
nonsolidas-don't like the way it looks-ugly colors<br />
swimming through a wormhole-beautiful colors, but I like it better when the color map numbers aren't the same-I like 2 with 6 the best<br />
helicopter ride over vegas-too slow and too bright most of the time<br />
shifting morals-don't like morals in most things, it is kinda boring and slow, but I love that planet<br />
painting tiles-dont like it<br />
iridescent river-AMAZING, I was making a river like preset but it looks not only ugly but pathetic when compared to this even though it does not look much like a river<br />
System Crash-good colors, not that interesting<br />
System Crash/Raz RMX-Don't like it<br />
marker on wall the wall- great preset<br />
Claustrophobia-This one looks better then the original especially the little line things in the middle<br />
afternoon refreshments-I like blue<br />
miami-It is pretty boring<br />
pyrotechnics-great DM and great color map<br />
pyrotechnics/skupers RMX-it's okay, I guess, I like the original better for that DM<br />
video card-excellent, it's got everything and it actually looks a little like my graphics card<br />
misfired neurons-nice scope<br />
oceanview-this looks better without that line<br />
liquid voltage-great scope great DM great colors, this my favorite preset so far<br />
puddle in solitude- I don't listen to any lonely or depressing music, and I don't like this, it is a nice scope though<br />
chrome current-I liked the original enough, this is just better! Nice job on that flow contest, you probably got about 20 times as many points as I got<br />
inverted colors-not very interesting<br />
pleasent migrane-don't like the preset very much but I like the scopes<br />
blueprint-the first one was good, this one is grand! I love it!<br />
einstein on drugs-nice scope, great background too<br />
football weather-the ball rolls on the ground, I can't ask for anything better<br />
<br />
EXCELLENT PACK! Major kudos on those flowy ones.<br />
If you stop making presets that would suck major monkey! So I hope you come back and keep coming back, or at least stay here as long as me!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, i got all enthused and decided to make a tribute preset.<br />
but then i kind of lost interest. or postponed it or something.<br />
<br />
So far the only reactivity is the lightning on beat, the speed of the wipers, and the water coming off the wipers... ill work opn it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is the goods.<br />
<br />
MY TRIBUTE TO SHOCK VALUE<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: The poor quality of this preseet does not in any way reflect siddhartha_one's respect and admiration towards Shock Value</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">amazing work shock :) my favorites were 'blast' and 'marker on the wall'.<br />
<br />
and siddharta that's a cool preset but i think it should use the whole avs screen. other than that it looks really cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2003, 08:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Blueprint and UnconeD's remix are the best presets I have ever seen. Overall i would give 5pts! Great Pack Dude! keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2003, 10:09</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Wow! Sid you're tribute looks cool!:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, a tribute to me? I have one pack out so far, don't you think it's a little early? Anyway, I like it a lot, especially the effect of the water flowing down from the wipers. <br />
<br />
Two tips: 1. At higher resolutions you can see black lines on the road. I think you can modify the Movement to fix that or change it to dynamic shift or even a convo filter. 2. The screen doesn't seem to be centered on my computer. It's always at the bottom part of the screen. I think you can modify/remove the last Movement to fix that. <br />
<br />
Once again, excellent preset! It has great atmosphere to it. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sid: Dude... wrong side of the road :P.<br />
<br />
(let the flaming commence!)<br />
<br />
It's cool, but a bit too dark. And a bit stupid to have the black area at the top. And I really expected a correctly reflecting rear-view mirror from you ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">btw. just one note. I didn't see &quot;Following a comet&quot; or &quot;science&quot; in this pack... Too bad, because those are still in my favorites folder from &quot;as seen on TV&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hehe, yeah.. if only you could come to australia and drive ucd, hilarity.<br />
<br />
I started a rv mirror but it got ugly and fps sucking so i ditched it.. funny you should mention :D<br />
<br />
i put the annoying black line at the top at the last minute because it didnt look like a car if you could see all the way up, if you remove it, youll get much more fps too, because its actually just a high n'ed scope. (what was i thinking)<br />
<br />
once again, this is an insane pack.. i still cant get over blueprint<br />
<br />
ill try and make it nicer for my pack..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I hate to bump an old thread up, but I just released this pack on DeviantArt.<br />
<br />
Get it here:<br />
Energy (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2946959/) <br />
<br />
In it you will find that I removed the preset &quot;Miami&quot; (becuase it sucks) and added new versions of &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Following A Comet&quot;. Unfortunately there is no installer, so you will have to create a folder. If you already got this pack off the forum, I would just download it and unzip the two new presets, unless you want the numbering to be correct, in which case I would delete the old and unzip all of the new.</div></div><hr />
