<div class="posttext">This is somekind of a &quot;standard&quot; reply to new people who for some reason miss all of the helpful topics and the search warnings. I think that if this is just copy&amp;pasted as a reply, we could eliminate some of the hostility around here towards new people. If you see a topic by a new member that you know has a answer already in some thread, just simply post this message to them and forget about it. None can acclaim after this that they haven't received any help or have experienced somekind of flaming.<br />
This still might need a bit of work, so if you have any spelling corrections or suggestions, post them. I'll update it as long as i can.

--- Standard AVS Reply ---<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have discovered AVS, that is wonderful, AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement, it is a fun tool to play with and it is a great thing to watch at while you play your favourite music. <br />
<br />
However you have asked a AVS related question that has been asked &amp; answered several times before. Here in the AVS forums we respect and value such skills as:<br />
<br />
Searching (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php)<br />
Simply put: Search before you post, you might have already seen the bold red letters above the posting window, or you might have missed them for some reason, maybe red isn't a striking or alarming color to you. By searching for the answer you're looking for, you will get the answer you want immediately, instead of posting a question that has been posted before and waiting for a reply which usually takes several hours, sometimes even days to get and it might not even be a reply you will appreciate.<br />
<br />
Reading the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567)<br />
If you didn't know, FAQ stands for: Frequently Asked Questions, it simply is a list of questions and answers to questions that over the long period of time have been asked multiple times. Since answering these questions each time they are asked can get boring and time wasting, we prefer usually not to answer them directly, but rather point you to the FAQ, where a pre-written and descriptive answer can be read. The FAQ explains the situation and solution much better than a quick reply by someone else.<br />
<br />
Checking out the tutorials (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060)<br />
Striving to be an AVS artist? That is wonderful. Have a question about how to make something in AVS? Before you post this question it is recommended and expected by other AVS artists that you read the AVS tutorials enlisted here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060), before you post your question. The tutorials are a wonderful source created by long time AVS artists to learn the basics and sometimes even the more complex features of AVS. Realize that since this is a hobby for most of us, no one is going to hold your hand and teach you AVS from ground up. Believe it or not, but all of us have learned AVS by ourselves, some of the people who have been AVS artists for years didn't even have these wonderful tutorials at disposal and we had to learn everything by experimenting! You are indeed lucky to have such great resources available to you, use them well and wisely, but most importantly read them before you ask.<br />
<br />
Remember these guidelines and you should have no problems in your AVS future. And welcome to the AVS forums :up:<br />

<div class="posttext">Indeed, i guess this is not a bad idea. Keep this Tug.<br />
<br />
BTW: What has happend to this forum while i've been away?<br />
I can remember a time when peopel tryed to be productive in here, there've been some avs contests and cool shit like that. Now as i come back, only few peopel of the old community are still there and all beeing lil' Atero's instead of using this forum in the way they claim they want it to: beeing produktive, exchanging skills and whatnot.<br />
<br />
There always were and will be some n00borz, annoying the heck outa you, and even more some dumbasses loggin in on fresh accounts to provoke flaming discussions.<br />
<br />
But what the fuck's the matter?<br />
<br />
I guess what the REAL annnoying thing is, is the fact that there are more such sensless threads then usefull posts.<br />
<br />
What can you do about it? Flame every dumbfucker and waste your time??<br />
<br />
What you can do is:<br />
-Post a Standard reply, the above one seems pretty good to me<br />
-Let the thread die, for gods sake, or get it locked asap<br />
-Post MORE usefull stuff in here, so the crap will look minor and will vanish to a tiny dot on the scale<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, if you care.<br />
<br />
If i've gotten a wrong point of view, feel free to enlighten me.</div></div><hr />

That's just my new spin on it. I've added a bit of formatting, removed some that was a little too condescending or sarcastic to me. I also changed a few words around, and fixed up a tiny bit of the grammer. Yay? Nay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement; it is a fun tool<br />

Why the ';' ? A error or?<br />
<br />
No AVS artist ever had these tutorials<br />
No AVS artist? Certainly they are available now atleast :p<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I used the semicolon because I read that sentence as two separate clauses, though I may be wrong. Where are the local grammer nazis when you need them?!<br />
<br />
The second part is a bit confusing to myself as well. &quot;Some AVS artist didn't even have these tutorials at their disposal...&quot; That confused me too so I tried to make it sound better, but you .... now it makes sense, in mid-typing! Maybe if you changed it back to what it was before, but made it &quot;artists&quot;? I don't know, nevermind. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heh, it does say artist in the latest revision, that was a mistake, it should be plural. The very first version was: &quot;some of the people who have been AVS artists for years didn't even have...&quot; But then it got changed into &quot;some AVS artists didn't have...&quot; and i guess somewhere along the way typing mistakes were made.<br />
<br />
And i have no idea how to even use a semicolon :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok here is my updated suggestion, I feel it is much more rounded and polished now...<br />
<br />
Hello, Jerk<br />
<br />
It seems you have asked a typical nooby question which isnt really surprising because you are a noob. Noob. Why dont you try:<br />
<br />
- Searching <br />
DURRR<br />
<br />
- Reading the FAQ <br />
DURRR<br />
<br />
- Checking out the tutorials<br />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, not bad PAK-9, but you should include the links in the titles. Also you might consider using different words than &quot;noob&quot; or gtfo, most people don't understand them. You could replace noob with &quot;inexperienced&quot; or &quot;first timer&quot;, gtfo could be replaced by: &quot;go find your answers&quot; and all those DURRR's seem unnecessary, sometimes silence is stronger than mumbling. Also Jerk seems a bit weak of a word, try &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;idiot&quot;, they mean the same, but give a much stronger impression.<br />
<br />
Overall, not bad PAK-9, but could use a bit tweaking :up:</div></div><hr />

Edited as a compromise between Pak-9 and everyone else (Joking ;) ):<br />
<br />
Hello, new and enthusiastic Jerk! You have discovered AVS, that is Horrible (for us)! AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement, but please put it back where you found it and never speak of it again jerk. We don't want you here. <br />
<br />
However, it seems that you (yes you jerk) have asked a AVS related question that has been asked (by Jerks) and answered several times before, jerk. Here in the AVS forums we respect and value such skills as:<br />
<br />
- Searching (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php)<br />
Simply put: Search before you post n00b. You might have already seen the BIG SHINY RED LETTERS!!!1!!!1! jerk and the search (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php) link above the posting window, or you might have missed them because you are a blind Jerk. By searching for the answer you're looking for, you will get the answer you want immediately, instead of posting a question that has been posted before and waiting for a reply which usually takes several hours, sometimes even days to get, and it might (read, almost always) will explain nothing and just address you ass a n00b and bash you.<br />
<br />
- Reading the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567)<br />
If (n00b) you don't know, FAQ stands for: Frequently Asked Questions. It's a list of questions and answers to questions That have been asked frequently (DURRRR). Since answering these questions each time they are asked can become boring, as well as time wasting, we prefer usually not to answer them directly. Rather, we will call you a n00b and laugh at you. Anyway jerk, The FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567) explains the situation and solution much better than a quick reply by someone else, so use it Jerk.<br />
<br />
- Checking out the tutorials (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060)<br />
Striving to be an AVS artist? NOOOOOOO!!!! We hate n00bs on OUR internet. Have a question about how to make something in AVS? Read the AVS tutorials here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060),  Jerk, before you GTFO our internet. The tutorials are a useful source created by long time N00b bashers so that they don't have t speak to you. Realize n00b, that since this is a hobby for most of us, no one is going to hold your hand and teach you from the ground up jerk. Believe it or not, but you suck, and almost all of us have learned AVS by ourselves. Most AVS artists didn't even have these tutorials and had to learn everything from scratch by experimenting! You are indeed lucky to have such great resources available to you. Use them well and wisely, or you will be call a n00b for all your days, but even more importantly, read them, and never ask.<br />
<br />
Ignore these guideline and you shall have nightmares about   panda's, fires, Spiky Baseball Bats, and Nuclear war.  And if you do, don't ask us for help N00b.(or the dreams will become more frequent) :down:<br />

<div class="posttext">Ok I made a new sticky with the useful information contained here.<br />
<br />
However having noob-bashing threads (like this one is becoming) doesn't do anything to help a promote a friendly atompsphere that we should try and encourage on this forum.<br />
<br />
Nothing more to see here. <br />
