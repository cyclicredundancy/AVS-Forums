      ok, i made a bunch of presets that are 10x better than my meltdown pack. i think that i can possibly get 4 1/2 out of 5 stars if i keep this up. well, if iLove can, anything can. anyway, tell me what you think. i apreciate getting ripped on, so tear away. everything (besides the bmp's) is 100% mine, so don't even try to accuse me of copying.<br />
      <br />
      extract the pics (both of which aren't mine, i give proper credit in the comments of the presets that use them) to the winamp/plugins/avs directory. put the avs's in winamp/plugins/avs/new folder<br />
      <br />
      give me some feed back yo.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, my favourite is posessed. (I still think Second Reality is one of the best demos ever)<br />
      <br />
      I wouldn't mind seeing something more happening in sphere. The flipping back and fort doesn't do it for me, it needs something else.<br />
      <br />
      There's my two cents.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, definately more interesting. I'm not a huge fan of sdden cuts though. It makes me harder to please on beat responsiveness.<br />
      <br />
      I took out the onbeat stuff and made gave i a sine value. Only problem is it loses beat responsiveness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey i fixed it. all i had to do was dissaciate the actual plotting of x with the sin(a) so that way it wouldnt get all stretched out when sin(a) got really close to zero. and i changed the bg too... tell me what you think about the new one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like it alot. :D<br />
      <br />
      I found the white a bit bright though, so I made the bg colour a dark green and a fade from yellow on beat. I upped the gridsize and turned down the alpha in an attemp to fix some bleeding at the edges on the sphere, perhaps it the colours I chose, I dunno. The bleeding wasn't the when it was black.<br />
      <br />
      I like it alot. :D</p>
