<div class="posttext">You've just posted a frequently asked question. The answer can be found in the FAQ (link (http://acko.net/avsfaq.php)) or by searching the forums (click &quot;Search the forums&quot; at the top).<br />
<br />
We do this all in our spare time, so we're trying our best to avoid unnecessary posts like yours. If you're a new user, welcome to these forums. Feel free to ask other questions, but please take five minutes of your time to make sure it hasn't been asked before: that way you don't have to wait for someone else to answer it, because the answer is already out there...<br />

<div class="posttext">BTW the next time you have a problem, try using *your* brain to solve it, try something immensely simple, like... geez... i dunno... looking through the menus? Its not hard and it doesn't even require that you know what AVS is, this applies to all software - look through the menus for an option or selection menu of some kind that will remedy your problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Go to the config window, open the Presets/Hotkeys screen in the settings menu, and uncheck Randomly switch presets. And next time you might want to check the FAQ to see if it's there, like UC said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Next time he still won't check the FAQ because he knows you'll be here to answer his question.  (Why waste your own time when you can waste someone elses?)  That was kind of the point of not answering him in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whatever. I believe in helping. Can we NOT have this conversation again, please?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My point is you're not helping him, you're just giving him the answer.  Think about it this way: If someone next to you in math class asks you what the answer to number 4 is, when you give him the answer without telling him how to get it, you're doing him no good at all because he isn't learning anything.</div></div><hr />
