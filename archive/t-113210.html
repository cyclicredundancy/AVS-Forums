      <p class="post-content">BTW the next time you have a problem, try using *your* brain to solve it, try something immensely simple, like... geez... i dunno... looking through the menus? Its not hard and it doesn't even require that you know what AVS is, this applies to all software - look through the menus for an option or selection menu of some kind that will remedy your problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Go to the config window, open the Presets/Hotkeys screen in the settings menu, and uncheck Randomly switch presets. And next time you might want to check the FAQ to see if it's there, like UC said.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Next time he still won't check the FAQ because he knows you'll be here to answer his question. (Why waste your own time when you can waste someone elses?) That was kind of the point of not answering him in the first place.</p>

      <p class="post-content">My point is you're not helping him, you're just giving him the answer. Think about it this way: If someone next to you in math class asks you what the answer to number 4 is, when you give him the answer without telling him how to get it, you're doing him no good at all because he isn't learning anything.</p>
