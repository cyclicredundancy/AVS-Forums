		I assume you mean the dropdown menu that includes &quot;AVS editor&quot; and &quot;Go fullscreen&quot;?

		Actually it belongs here, as it would be a feasture of the AVS, and yes i am speaking of the drop doen menu.  I know that you can go full screen that way, but not desktop mode.

		this forum is all about avs related stuff. however, adding a button that does what you ask for is something the developers do, so i think it belongs to the winamp development forum. nobody can/will help you here, sorry.<br />
<br />
it could be, that adding that button can be done using wasabi, still you'd have to ask that elsewhere (skinning forum?).<br />
<br />
good luck!

		OK, if this is the AVS wish list, then why would this not be the place to put my wish. I am not asking for a button. I am asking for a modification of the popup menu.<br />
<br />
Here is what I am suggesting.<br />
<br />
When you right-click in the AVS window, and you see several options ie:<br />
<br />
Fullscreen<br />
AVS Editor<br />
Dock in AVS editor<br />
--------------------- (separator)<br />
(a listing of presets)<br />
<br />
I am suggesting that an additional option be added as such<br />
<br />
Fullscreen<br />
<b>Toggle Desktop Mode </b>&lt;- <br />
AVS Editor<br />
Dock in AVS editor<br />
--------------------- (separator)<br />
(a listing of presets)<br />
<br />
Considering that this menu is (to the best of my knowledge) gerated by the AVS plugin, and not winamp.  I dont understand why this should not be here.

		OK, so can you tell me what the AVS Wishlist forum is for then?  This is a wish I have for the AVS plugin.  Logically this is the place to put it!

		yath: you didn't need to be so harsh in that first post, it's not common knowledge or anything.<br />
<br />
as for you whiterayven, ffs...if it's not something that the AVS DEVELOPERS can do, but the WINAMP DEVELOPERS are responsible for, it belongs in the winamp development forum.  thi wishlist forum is for things that the AVS developers can change, and if you don't bring it to the attention of the winamp developers it'll never get done, and we're not going to do it for you.

		The AVS Wishlist forum /is/ for wishes for the AVS program. The developers are supposed to monitor it here: why else do you think we have a wishlist here?<br />
<br />
Not everything posted here is directed at everyone...

		Yes, let's just shut up and let the Moderators decide where it goes....<br />
<br />
I think it's a great idea, even if it is somewhat of a video card hack.  <br />
<br />
I like overlay mode, especially when you put it on someone's computer when they aren't looking and they don't know what it is or how to turn it off :D:p
