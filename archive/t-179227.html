			<strong>My new AVS pack</strong><br />
		
		

		It's been a while since i've been on, months in fact, but i've been away trying to make new AVS's.<br />
<br />
they're still kinda newbieish, especially 2k1 which i'm not at all happy about but it's in there.<br />
<br />
however, my 'coupé de gras' is in here, my Winamp AVS game, VIS INVADERS. it spend ages making this and it was only when i started experimenting with the Texter APE that i managed to make it work (before, it was a superscope ship and a Convoloution Filter made enemy)<br />

		the lava lamp is good :) you need to work on the background though :)<br />
<br />
vis invaders... my ship becomes invisible after taking 2 hits?<br />
anyway, good game :) beat reaction isnt that unfair here because the number of enemies is limited... well done :)<br />
just the level change is not so good i think... you should make it time/point/enemy based instead of next-song-based...<br />
<br />
btw it's &quot;coup de grÃ¢ce&quot; according to my dictionary ;) (in english and in french)

		Not bad... not bad! vis invaders, lava lamp and neon jump gate was good, but I think you sholud work more on other presets... Since they are ''empty'', but you know the base coding. But it's a good improvement since your last pack, so keep it up ;)
