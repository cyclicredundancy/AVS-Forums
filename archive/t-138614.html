<div class="posttext">I'm interested in implementing a sort of static (in that it's always on) DM source map. The problem is that I can't exactly figure out how the source map works. Can someone help me with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="posttext">source map moves the color of each pixel into it's target position and leaves everything else black.  normally it's the other way around; the color of the target pixel is moved into the original.  for example:<br />
x=x*2;<br />
normally the pixel at x is colored according to the pixel at x*2.  source map reverses this; the pixel at x*2 is colored by the pixel at x.<br />
in the long run, it's better to try to reverse the function before trying to use a source map, because source mapping just plain looks ugly.  if you're not familiar with inverse functions then you need to brush up on your algebra - basically it's taking the function f(x)=..., replacing every instance of x with f(x)^-1 and every instance of f(x) with x, then solving for f(x)^-1.  so the inverse of f(x)=x*2 is<br />
x=f(x)^-1*2<br />
x/2=f(x)^-1<br />
there are a few cases i can think of where you would want an actual source map for data storage and whatnot, but i really can't see anybody that isn't unconed and isn't me using that, and i certainly can't.  why did you want it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
not that i am in any way as good as unconed, but i'm about the only other person on this forum that would resort to tricky hacks like that...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yah, why do you want it for??(i mean i'm not able to use souce mapping in mov's to a good effect:( )</div></div><hr />

<br />
read the fine print boyz.. its a challenge!!!!<br />
<br />
atero, get yur arse off the parade float. If you said that for any other reason aber to get yer rocket off, and to have a spill at UCD, id like to know it.<br />
<br />
BTW, source map can be extreamely useful, and it can do many things that inverses cant (without a great deal of additional coding)<br />
For one, source map doesnt edge stretch, so you can make nice looking dms that are smaller than the screen size without having that ugly stretch on the sides, or resorting to the fungly add borders APE.<br />
<br />
Also, you can use a blank screen and a source mapped movement to make nce solid shapes, rather than using a hefty n'ed super scope.<br />
<br />
[edit] btw, there is no source map for the DM, you mean the normal movement i presume.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sid, you are a total fucking moron, you know that?  i said i'm the only one who *would* resort to those measures just for a damned preset.  i also went on to say that i *could not* do so.<br />
if there was any reason to that post other than to try and instigate an argument (and if i had a dime for every time you've accused me of doing that i'd be a rich man), you tell me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This sparked a huge argument on finnish flash between Atero and Sid, just in case anyone cared. :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero: Well, actually my original idea would be to reverse a 3D DM just for the heck of it and see what it would look like... It could also be useful for a couple of my &quot;trippy diner&quot; presets. I understand what you're saying about function inverses... I'm just wondering if there's some sort of shortcut if you know x, y, x' and y'...<br />
Siddhartha: I'm talking about implementing source map in a DM. If I wanted to just have a static movement map I would of course use a regular movement, but that doesn't seem to work so well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So you are wanting to implement a source map in a DM , then this should be in the wishlist aint it???:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Siddhartha, don't worry if i get into arguments i either come up with a correct and relevant argument and present it in a mature and adult way or i say &quot;i lub joo too&quot; or some such :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So, aside from all of the non-existant  ;)  arguements, does anyone know how to duplicate the source map effect without re-writing the equations?</div></div><hr />
