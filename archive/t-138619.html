<div class="posttext">Here is a rather simple, but pretty cool &quot;worm&quot; effect i did about a couple of weeks ago. It took me quite a bit (because im stupid) of coding, but finally got it to work. Anyway im not here to talk about the code or the scopes...<br />
<br />
After i had those scopes finished i couldn't think of anything cool to add to it (like a dm or something), this is the point where you people with juicy ideas come to the picture ;) I need something, an idea is all i need to make this worm pattern work good... I couldn't think of anything yet else than that stupid rotating&amp;sliding dm, but maybe you have an idea for it? If yes, tell me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Look more like circuits to me(worm's are little more...um..flexible right?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Looks really nic, but you might want to change the name (for some reason it gave me a very bad mental image ;) :p )<br />
<br />
You also might want to touch up the DM a bit.  Maybe have the rotation reverse every x number of beats... (not quite sure what x would be)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ishan, never played the classic worm game? Or your worm game on your nokia mobile phone? :p They aren't very &quot;Flexible&quot;... It's a classic worm movement :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th June 2003, 09:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yes i have played 'em but those game have only one worm which goes on increasing in length but in this preset there are so many that they look like microchip circuits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th June 2003, 15:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Theres nothing wrong with the worm effect, that looks sweet, just try making a more complex DM for it to be textured on, eg my stupidly unfitting one:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th June 2003, 17:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Holy cow!:eek: Raz's remix looks awesome ! <br />
Look so sweet!(i wish i could make something like that:( )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ishan how did you open Raz's Remix?  It comes up as a unknown file on my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th June 2003, 20:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ahh, crappy winzip files, just rename it and add &quot;.zip&quot; to the end of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Wiser87</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 00:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">&lt;geek&gt;oh it's easy... it just seems that Pixelcraft forgot the &quot;.zip&quot; at the end.  Just add .zip to the end of the filename.&lt;/geek&gt; :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 00:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">*sigh* :rolleyes: You open a folder, click on the tools or view tab, whichever has &quot;folder options&quot; in it, now open that and click on the &quot;view&quot; tab on that. Now uncheck &quot;hide file extensions for known file types&quot;, now rename the file with a &quot;.zip&quot; at the end.<br />
<br />
Was that thorough enough? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 07:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice dm raz, not quite what i had in mind :p But that worm pattern seems to fit in there :) The fog on the other hand looks fugly since it's rainbow-colored and the pattern is only in 2 colors... If you want i can add that as a remix to my next pack, if you change the fog to a more fitting one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 08:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Raz, just putting in on your DM is not exactly what I'd call effort... And to me, it doesn't really fit in too well :/<br />
<br />
My remix (Fine, so it's not better :P)<br />
<br />
And due to the spaces in the name, please refer to the previous posts for unzipping problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nic01, now that's what a call a &quot;mixing&quot; indeed :) Pretty cool, can i include it into the pack? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tuggumi: Ahh that one is nice ;) I like the idea... <br />
Raz &amp; Nic: Mhh.. I think your remixes just kill the original idea of an worm style preset. Anyways, good work.<br />
<br />
Will try to remix after returning from university.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 09:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Just a point out to all you mixers out there, i will be publishing the pack next wednesday so you got little time to remix it if you want your remix to be included in the pack. Why the rush? Well my summer holiday starts after next week and i won't be around here for 8 weeks, so that's why the rush.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Click here for my official response :D :</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">...So you made several maps for it, put the cmap below the DM, and added a convo o_O<br />
No more mixing from me for this one, sorry :P<br />
And yes, you can include it in the pack :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 21:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Just because i didn't spend 4 hours on it doesn't mean it doesn't look good :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">raz: would be nice if the camera would make some turns and changes direction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th June 2003, 01:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Bleh, tis been done. This is just a remix, i'll do some more work on the full DM before i release a pack with something not been done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Definately can be improved, tugg. THe no. of ssc's in the effect list are HUGE. By some clever coding, they can be reduced to a few.<br />
And I think this should have a strech dm, will look gr8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th June 2003, 06:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, you can reduce the amount of SSCs, but chances are, you'll be doing twice the calculation for 2 SSCs in 1. (See UnConeD's topic in main AVS forums).<br />
<br />
Multiscoping is gone for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">shreays, with such simple scopes with only 1 numpoint each, i guess it doesn't really matter that much wheter or not it's optimized or not... Besides i almost broke my head while banging it to my keyboard just to figure this one out :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So here is mine killing the worm idea myself ;) I guess it needs some more work at the movements. <br />
<br />
@Raz: The second one is much better. Sweet.</div></div><hr />
