		Actually I think the wishlist forum was just an evil plot to make sure all our wishes get redirected from their mailboxes into something else :rolleyes: :D. I think the fact that we now have a compiled wishlist is helping though. The only thing I don't like is that it currently has every wish, ranging from bugs to partial rewrites... that might cause it to lose some appeal, because an AVS developer might get the idea that it's not serious.
