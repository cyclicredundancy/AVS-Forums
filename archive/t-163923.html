<div class="posttext">In reading through this forum, I have discovered that some consider it wise for newbies to post their presets here before releasing them in a pack.  Over the last few weeks, I have played around with AVS alot and I have come up with some pretty cool presets.  Please tell me what you think.  Any comments/suggestions/tips welcome.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">m8, you got more than potentian... if you keep working on avs you'll be very good very fast :)<br />

The Shapemaker<br />
Crystalline Web<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">It really shows that you're not afraid of coding, unlike many other starterrs and that really pays off here.<br />
Sure, there are things that could be done different, but for a first start, this is really good. Most first presets aren't much more than Moving Particle+Water+Blitter Feedback called &quot;Hyperspacetunnel&quot; <br />
<br />
Try to download packs from others - It will inspire you and you can learn a lot by learning how they do things. At first, this will be frightening, but you'll learn things along the way. Also try if you can gat PiR's tutorial and Atero's Primer. That explains about all there is.<br />
<br />
Best one: Fairydust<br />
then: Crystalline Web<br />
The shapemaker needs some work, it runs kinda slow.<br />
The picture for Drunken Amoebic Rainbow was missing though. Be sure to add that when you submit.<br />
Overall score for a first pack: 3.25/5</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some very interesting presets indeed. Keep it up, you have more than just potential, you got a feeling for it. Next time, please post in the presets subforum ;).<br />
<br />
Welcome to the community :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad for a first. Some notes:<br />
<br />
Shapemaker:<br />
- The first effect list is way too heavy. Move it to the end and figure out how to achieve the same effect with minimal components. Then move it back in.<br />
- There are way too many buffer saves here, I doubt you'll need them all. If I disable the effect list with the 4 buffer saves in it, I don't notice any difference in output.<br />
- The trans/fast brightness + trans/fast brightness + trans/colormap can be optimized to a simple colormap, because the colormap is set to replace. Just remove the brightnesses, and divide the positions of the colors in the map by 4 (use right-click &gt; set position).<br />
- The convolution with only 1 entry and scale 1 is useless.<br />
- Instead of 2 multipliers, consider a colormap. You're only using the brightness anyway, 'cos the colors are added at the end.<br />
<br />
Those crazy celtics:<br />
- Your setup with buffer saves is a bit crazy for two reasons: first, you should first copy 1 dot to 2, and then copy those 2 to 4. This way, you save a copy operation. Secondly, instead of all those buffer saves, you can just use a couple of effect lists:<br />
Effectlist (I:Replace/O:Additive) { Trans/Movement: r=r+$pi*.5 }<br />
Effectlist (I:Replace/O:Additive) { Trans/Movement: r=r+$pi }<br />
If you don't mind accuracy loss, you could just do the 2 movements in the main loop, set to blended, and do a x4 multiplier at the end.<br />
<br />
The same applies to Fairydust.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks UnConeD for the tips.  On &quot;Those Crazy Celtics&quot; I saved a very noticeable number of FPS.  The other two I also sped up, but I just like them better at 10 FPS than I do at 16-17.  Is there any way I can limit the FPS in a given preset?  That way I could optimize them and set the FPS to 10 and everybody could see them exactly the way I do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nope, it's been asked before, but till now, there's no result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th January 2004, 12:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Would that technically be possible?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">;-c: Why not, if the AVS API allowed reading of current FPS info? Wishlist this, someone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Yathosho</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th January 2004, 17:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i like the eye in the sky preset, oldskool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th January 2004, 00:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You can read the current FPS:<br />
<br />
Frame:<br />
<br />
deltatime = gettime(time);<br />
fr=fr*.9+deltatime*.1;<br />
framerate=1/fr;<br />
time = gettime(0);<br />
<br />
Try that and use the value of framerate to adjust your presets accordingly. For example, if you really did want a limited FPS, use a superscope with varying n values to target a specific framerate (increase n values if above target, lower them if above, although this does not have to be done linearly).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, as your first pack, it's really cool. My fav was Spastic Elastic, very smooth colors.<br />
<br />
Keep experimenting with the effects, and study others' avs', and you'll become a great avs'er in no time.</div></div><hr />
