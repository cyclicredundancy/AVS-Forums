      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS hotkey to go back and forward in presets</strong><br />
      Thats what i would like to see in the next release. Im just too lazy to arrange my presets, but i watch the avs over my tv in fullscreen and it would be great if i could jump forward and back in the presets with some hotkeys, with some plugin i would use my gamepad for that as control for winamp than. Sometimes there are presets that just dont match to the music i listen at this even moment and i dont like to wait till the next preset cames onscreen, 'cause i let it now switch the presets every 60 seconds so i really can enjoy them for a while, but waiting 60 seconds with some not really good matching preset for the kind of music isnt that fun.<br />
      I randomize my music often and it switches near instantly from fast to slow things and so on, even if i would sort my presets it would be not fine to select my arrangement at every new song.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>isn't there...</strong><br />
      I thought there were keys that manipulate which presets to switch to. Such as the preset/hotkeys option, and pressing the space key will randomly choose a vis from the directory set within that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey! such hotkey is already done!<br />
      the keys "y" and "u" do the trick ...<br />
      <br />
      the problem is that they're active only when avs window is active so we should persuade nullsoft heads to make it active all the time ...<br />
      <br />
      cheers<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey this y and y stuff is something i didnt knew before, but is not much worth. I use the avs fullscreen on my tv or overlay on my monitor, the avs is minimized then.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, if the AVS window's not active when it's used, I don't see how you could possibly expect to be able to control it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">sorry, but with that you can define hotkeys for specific presets, not go stright linear forward and/or back.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, they work the same way as u and y anyway, it's not possible to control AVS if it's not the active window. If it's fullscreen, you can use u and y, though.</p>
