      <p class="post-content">Hey, I've only been at this for a month or so, and I've only made original stuff. Granted, not all of it is high quality, but you can't expect it to be. Doing it yourself is the best way to learn how to do it. Trust me, just start cranking stuff out, you'll get better quickly. Good luck! :)<br />
      <br />
      Oh, by the way... I saw a couple of yours (one original and one remix). Not bad, not bad at all, in my opinion (for what it's worth). Keep at it.</p>
