<div class="posttext">First of all, i have my avs folder backed up. I was on 5.24 which no longer works at all on my pc. Did a clean install of 5.31, then a clean reinstall of 5.24 again when the weirdness became apparent (still refused to work at all). Then another clean install of 5.31.<br />
<br />
Now the weirdness. The 'alphaout' expression in effect lists seems to only work as 'alphaou' now. And half of PAK-9 AVS 5 is fucked up for reasons that are beyond me. It seems to only affect the newer more complicated features so that particular pack is the most obviously affected that i have. Example, the beanies don't move, AVS Blox just sits there with a piece at the top not doing shit, no rotation on nebulous.<br />
<br />
A hearty WTF over here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes it does, and that fixed everything. With the dll from 5.24 everything is normal, with the dll from 5.31, it's all broke. That draws me to the conclusion that vis_avs.dll has been fucked with.</div></div><hr />

I dread to think some mindless nub has broken it whilst tinkering. well you can blame me then for giving benski modded code to fix avs from not storing vis_avs.dat in the folder to follow the multi-user settings. afaik that is all that was changed, i made sure when doing my modifications that i didn't change anything else so it could be related to a compile option on the nullsoft build machines.<br />
<br />
can you provide me one or two definite presets to try it out with and i'll happily look into seeing if i can fix whatever i messed up (how changing a getmodulefilename to a sendmessage has broken something else beats me :confused: )<br />

<div class="posttext">I haven't tested the new version, so I can't tell if the gettime() function is the only thing that's broken.<br />
<br />
Here's the most basic way to test the gettime function:<br />
<br />
 The SuperScope fills reg00 with the time in seconds since you booted your system.<br />
 The Text displays the content of reg00.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Strange. This sounds totally unrelated. If I had to guess at the cause it would be that someone typoed in the evallib routine for gettime(). Here is a test preset:<br />
<br />
render/superscope<br />
<br />
init: n = 1;<br />
<br />
point:<br />
x = sin(gettime(0)+i);<br />
y = 2*i-1;<br />
<br />
Should be a slowly oscillating sine wave. With the bug it goes either very fast or random.<br />
<br />
If this new source is public I will check it out when I get home. No compiler at work that supports the myriad of ms specific features that avs leverages. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Nanakiwurkz: if you understood what OO, compiling or linking meant you wouldn't have made your suggestion. A 'missing object' means no code gets generated, i.e. no vis_avs.dll to be distributed with Winamp so that we can notice this bug. i.e. your statement is logically false as a consequence of the very fact that you wrote it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well i've just tried both 2.81b and 2.81c with Warrior of the Light's example and it displays an incrementing number (which is probably the number of seconds since the system started - can't check the api in use but that's my best guess)<br />
<br />
so from things, i'm guessing that incrementing number is not to be seen with the 2.81c build?<br />

<div class="posttext">Just reinstalled the new avs dll. Strangely the gettime api appears to work when testing with text output and superscopes, but the old presets using it do not.<br />
<br />
Must investigate more...<br />
<br />
If you want to see a preset broken by it try loading my Starfighter Redux preset in winamp forums compilation 2, also in PAK-9 AVS 5 the CWT presets, Shooting Stars, Droplets, AVS Blox and Beanies seem to not work either... I have similar problems in all of my unreleased J10 presets too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">testing on my own machine and not one at work makes things soo much easier. i've had a look at things and i'm not sure why but the build i've just run seems to work the same as 2.81b does (but with my multi-user fixes).<br />
<br />
working with the Starfighter Redux preset, with official 2.81c the flashing blob (best i can describe it just isn't there/visible) whereas with my test build and the 2.81b compile it shows clearly in the middle of the avs frame (now i'm hoping that's the correct result i should be seeing). i'm just going to do a fresh clean compile and will upload it in a bit (since i was dabbling with some fullscreen/multimonitor handling but never get things working correctly mainly since i've never directly done anything like it before)<br />

<div class="posttext">http://www.nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/vis_avs.zip is a clean compile of the 2.81b code with the changed files from here (http://www.nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/vis_avs_changed.zip) (well apart from the change in main.cpp to bump the version). so from what i can see it really does look like something went wrong with the nullsoft final build (at least when i compare builds on my dev box)<br />

<div class="posttext">so is the test build working or not because with the complaints about the 2.81c build being broken we'd like some confirmation on if the alternative build is working correctly so we can look into the issue on the build system as needed or am i just wasting my time trying to help...

<br />
<div class="posttext">sorry. i forgot about this thread! i will test your build when i get home.<br />
<br />
edit: if i were you i would debug it using msvs, put a break point in the evallib gettime function and see if it catches the problem. since evallib uses those 'cut and paste' blocks of code you might have to make the evallib function call a copy of the original function so that you can step into the code there... i will try this myself later (provided the source code online is the latest ver)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">DrO</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th November 2006, 11:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">from the tests i did when checking out before the final run on that build everything was matching up from what i could tell against the 2.81b version (and the relevant functions were all outputting correctly from what i could see).<br />
<br />
i'm still not too sure why the nullsoft final build failed unless something wasn't configured correctly on their msvc6 setup (entirely possible since they dropped that as the main ide environment some time back)<br />

<div class="posttext">I am still curious why it went wrong. I've compiled avs using .net 2002/2003 before and there weren't any big problems that I can remember... need to try it under 2005 still though. 2005's project conversion is not as good, it fails to convert some of my 2003 projects nicely.. god knows what it might do with a vc6.0 project :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I downloaded the AVS source last night to mess around with it. The source on the download page http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/ is not the latest source. There is the zip file on this thread from Dr0 (I didn't see it last night)... but still... it would be nice if it the page was updated<br />
<br />
Incidentally I updated it to compile on .net 2005 with no problems... at least that I could find (i.e. not the original problem from this thread). The only changes I had to make were simple, mostly casts to clear up ambiguities, some default parameters removed from function pointers, etc...<br />
<br />
I did notice, however, that there are somethings which are quite sensitive to optimisation. e.g. &quot;Whole Program Optimisation&quot; fails, because it puts off generating some things until link, which means that some of the evallib hax don't work. There was something else but I can't remember it now...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if/when the source will be updated?</div></div><hr />

does that mean there is still space for speed optimization? [because for the things it does, avs is quite fast, imo] or does it just mean there's some awkward programming work in there?</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if/when the source will be updated? ni idea since i don't know who has access to the cvs on that/bundle but i'll try to see what can be done. the main issue with non msvc6 compiles is that things can't be optimised as you've pointed out and also it's not a known reliable compile (hence why sticking to building it at least for the moment in an environment which it was designed/created in)<br />
<br />
Grandchild: it won't be forgotten since it's already in the internal builds, it was just how the release was pushed before i got a chance to remind the devs to include it - the joys of uk/us time differences and me unfortunately working late on the day of release :( and i'm sure that it'll be added as a comment in the release notes (was an oversight in the other version when 2.81c appeared - the devs/myself are people at the end of the day and it does happen ;) )<br />
<br />
the optimisations jheriko are refering to are build options for speed/size but generally there's little to be noticed even when not running dlls in such a manner without those optimisations from what i've experienced over the years (maybe a few percent if that).<br />
<br />
Mattfury: blame me and then blame the nullsoft build machine (since i made a initial build that worked and then was recompiled by nullsoft and then i re-did the build and that's now the one in the pack/next winamp build). still not sure why the nullsoft build failed when that was done with the same project in msvc6 *shrugs*<br />

Don't confuse your ability to write awesomely optimised code from the start with a lack of functionality. If you write sufficiently terrible code they can make a very noticeable change. :)<br />
<br />
It also depends on the structure of the program. &quot;Whole program optimisation&quot; has a larger impact if your project has hundreds of small seperate files, for instance. Inline expansion only has an effect if you aren't already using inline where appropriate or using classes with inline definitions. etc...<br />
<br />
I think I have access to the cvs through sourceforge, I seem to remember accessing it once, but my computer is in shambles atm. It heavily crashes over pretty much anything (AVS, emulated games, screensavers.. they all make it reboot on the spot at random) so it will be a while (i need to get an SATA cable this weekend and reinstall loads of junk) before I bother to check that out..</div></div><hr />
