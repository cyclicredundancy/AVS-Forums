      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS 2.5.1 bug?</strong><br />
      Having a bit of a bug here, wondering if anyone else has it, and hopefully a better workaround for it.<br />
      <br />
      When I leave fullscreen (640x480 doubled), the resolution is set to the fullscreen resolution (640x480) w/o pixeldoubling. Now, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, except the the resolution doesn't change back until I resize the AVS window which ain't exactly the easiest thing when your mouse position is only updating 3 or 4 times a sec.<br />
      <br />
      When pixel doubling is turned on in windowed mode, it works fine. The only problem is then it's even more pixelated, and the window has to be four times to size to get the desired resolution. If I set fullscreen to 320x240, then it won't work on my T.V. :(<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt;<br />
      Anyone else have Winamp stutter when AVS is running?<br />
      &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
      <br />
      Any thoughts?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't know an actual fix to your problem, but it sounds like you have the performance slider in Windowed mode all the way to the left. This means that AVS will suck up all available resources to draw itself and can interfere with the music playing.<br />
      <br />
      I suggest you put it a few notches to the right and see if that helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Huh, go figure. It happened to me several times last night. Seems AVS works fine today. ??:confused:?? I'm actually running more stuff now than I was then. :igor:<br />
      <br />
      I think I'll keep 2.78c around for a bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm having a similar problem... my winamp2 avs is slowing everything down, seemingly at random, although now i'm using winamp3 all of the time so i've just left it, i changed my process priority back to normal and moved my framerate slider to the right in varying degress but it did nothing... :(</p>
