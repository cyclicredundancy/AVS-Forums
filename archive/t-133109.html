      First AVS pack. Kinda Noob-ish, but I think you will see some advancement.<br />
      <br />
      Any comments are welcome, and ratings on the presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I looked for the Somewhat like deviation button LOL ! Im really a DA addict...Well,the pack is,yes.noobish but i like it,its a beggining :) I see you are learning to code,and you are starting it very good,just dont user from the beggining polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates together,you can get pretty ugly stuff if you dont know what are you doing.Learn to use x,y first then r,d then mix them ;) Have fun ! Im going on a 7 days vacation to my grandma`s house in a wine regios so you wont see me.Happy Easter everyone ! Have fun !</p>

      <p class="post-content">color ripples- too n00bish, the DDM is too close to the original<br />
      electric puddle- too fast, hard to see what is going on<br />
      rainbow flower- nice, a little crowded. make the base a little more advanced first.<br />
      flash canyon- more movement, esp. 3D will make this much better<br />
      mirror room- not much here<br />
      rainbow lake- use alpha blending to make it look nicer. doesn't look too watery<br />
      spinning wheel- looks chunky (not very smooth), not very reactive<br />
      stuck in the flash tunnel- see above</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>Electric Puddle</b> - If you don't know what something does then don't use it. This is my philosopy anyways. Not bad of a preset, and you did use some of your own code in the movements. The DDM really ruins it IMO. If you need help with DM's and the like search the forums or try pming someone(I will help you start out if you need it).<br />
      <b>Fire Flower</b> - Thank god that the rotating stars are hidden under the movements and interference and stuff. I would reccommend making a SSC instead of using the built in [crappy] renders. The interference also makes this extremely repetitive.<br />
      <b>Flash Canyon</b> - The SSC is extremely chaotic. Try something that is less chaotic. Also, try using alpha blending to hide the stuff in the distance, and possibly help conceal the sharp edges(this is advanced, though, so you can put it off until you learn more about it). Also the static movement inside the effectlist just creates horizontal lines completely defeating the purpose of using any sort of DM. It also makes the preset look worse overall.<br />
      <b>Mirror Room</b> - I do not like moving particles or rotating stars. Use something else. Also, replace/replace effectlists don't do anything - just bring the stuff outside of the effectlist. Instead of using a static movement for the rotation, try using a DM that will cause it to continue to rotate, and change directions/speeds(if you need help, search the forums/ask someone).<br />
      <b>Rainbow Sea</b> - The solid colors above the "water" really detract from this preset, but the vertical and horizontal lines are blaringly obvious and really hurt the preset. They appear because the superscope is very concentrated along those lines. Try using a different superscope that moves around some and doesn't stick out as much.<br />
      <b>Spinning Wheel</b> - Don't use random SSC's - they can cause Winamp to crash(it crashed mine anyways). Also, don't multiply r times any fractions/decimals - that's what causes that horizontal break in the movement. Once again, I don't like mp's when used like this - they are very hard to use well. Also, DM's would help make this better.<br />
      <b>Stuck in da Flash Tunnel</b> - Don't like flashing presets. Don't like MP's. Don't use replace/replace effectlists. Don't use random DM's. Do learn some more on how to code DM's.<br />
      <b>Color ripples</b> - MP's again. This is just a bunch of built-ins thrown together. Try to come up with something that keeps this from being like half of the other presets out there.<br />
      <font color="red">Overall: 2.25</font>. Definitely learn how to code a bit better. Try not to use a lot of built-ins, and try to only use what you understand. Do this and you will improve. Not bad for a first pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">These are quite nice, but you still have a bit to go. It sort of looks like my first pack:)</p>
