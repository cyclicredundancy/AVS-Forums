			<strong>AVS Idea - Screen Choices</strong><br />
		
		

		Dear Winamp3rs, <br />
I have been using Winamp3's Advanced Visualisation Studion with my graphics card's TV-Out facility, but if I click Go Fullscreen it appears only on my monitor. I had to move the visualisation window onto the tv (I used extend my desktop onto this monitor) which meant I had the skin border around it which was annoying. <br />
<br />
I think that there should be a facility to select which screen the &quot;Go Fullscreen&quot; button sends the image to, so that people who either have TV-Out or Dual Head graphics cards can choose which to show the visualisation on, e.g. if you have a party and set up a projector on the second output pointing at the wall and have the first output connected to a monitor with the WinAmp control window on it so you can control playing/browse media library e.t.c. without having to dismiss the fullscreen visualisation. <br />
<br />
Please do not hesitate to express your thoughts on this matter. <br />
<br />

			<strong>hardware overlay</strong><br />
		
		

		I think this is dependant on hardware<br />
<br />
For instance, on my laptop, I have one overlay which is diaplayed on <br />
whichever display is the 'primary display'. and the tv out can only <br />
be primary when the external CRT is not in use.<br />
<br />
On my radeon VE, the overlay is stretched across all active screens<br />
<br />
On my dual graphics card setup, the PCI card does **NOT** have any way<br />
of displaying overlay (even though it has one on its own)<br />
<br />
So I feel that AVS authors are tied by the way of implementing multiple displays---<br />

		Install Windows XP so you can choose witch output is the primary and secondary display...So you can have your full screen overlay on the output you want and the control panel on the other one...

		But I think it would be a good idea for full screen user (not like me:)) to have the choice of the fullscreen graphic card...

			<strong>Multiple Screens and fullscreen</strong><br />
		
		

		I have just setup my new beast for party graphics intending to get the same functionality that you are looking for. AMD1700/Geforce4/XP Pro<br />
<br />
I have found that it is best to run fullscreen on display#1 and the controls on display#2 otherwise winamp/xp freaks out big time.<br />
<br />
So far its not been robust enough for use in a party where you need a crash free professional look. What I have found is that I can get a nice clean fullscreen running on my primary display and the controls on the secondary. I have loaded my fav presets to hotkeys and can mix it up quite nicely as long as I am not running fullscreen. Because as soon as you press a key to load a preset or open another application on the other screen you drop back to normal window display. VERY ANNOYING<br />
<br />
One solution that I plan to investigate is to try and find a program that lets you select an area of a desktop to be output to the TV OUT. That way you can run the visuals in a small screen and mix it up. It also provides much better performance than fullscreen.<br />
<br />
Does such a program exist? Where to start?<br />
<br />
The other solution would be for Nullsoft to provide more functionality/support for dual head video cards in a forthcoming release.

		If you use overlay mode you can run other things and even edit the preset that's running.

			<strong>Overlay Mode</strong><br />
		
		

		Yeah thats works wicked. Perfect. I used my 2nd screen as my primary display. Using the Nvidia extensions I can set various windows to not open in my primary display etc etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks

			<strong>another way to manage your presets list</strong><br />
		
		

		You say that you use hotkeys to manage your presets, but it's pretty much limited ! look the preswitcher thread (in general AVS thread) to get replacement softwares...

			<strong>preset software</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi Goebish. Your preset software is great. Much better than standard presets.<br />
<br />
I still prefer the method using kyb to load presets but your s/w is def great. I like to hit the preset in beat to music etc but i sometimes find a lag in transition. maybe its would be better with two winamp beasts and video mixer. i have the mixer just another pc reqd. that would be cool as<br />
<br />
I will get some suggestions/ideas to you soon when I have more time to play with your system:-)<br />
<br />
by any chance did you see the eurovision song contest on TV? the songs sucked but what looked like a massive winamp setup was quite impressive.<br />
<br />
ciao for now

			<strong>next version...</strong><br />
		
		

		well, if you prefer hotkeys management, I'll try to implement a hotkeys manager in my software so you could launch presets with each keys of your keyboard (and more with shift/ctrl/alt combination...) Look at the preswitcher thread as I post a message each time I make an improvement in playlister...And BTW, I use a videomixer and 2 PCs at parties, and yes it's really great:)but if youu own a videomixer, you can use your pc and a VCR with it (just pre record AVS sets on a tape..if you're VJing on hardcore, nobody will notice that's it's not synch:))<br />
Eurovision song contest ??? I receive sat in france, on which channel can I see it ?
