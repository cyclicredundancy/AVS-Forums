<div class="posttext">Does anyone know of or used anything like an app to compile code for avs like some kind of Big page app. where when you are typing alot of code you can see more of it at once. Anything that runs real time with AVS?. Is this totaly unheard of ??? Because mabey this should be in the wishlist section, but does anyone else find it a hinderance with the size of the text boxes when typing in alot of code. I'd personaly like to see it all at once what I'm typing rather than having to jump the cursor around lines of code...:eek:<br />
<br />
I thought you could type it up on a document program and then cut and paste it but is there anything that might .. i dont know ..link a page to the text boxes .  or something. or even a program thats like what I described that can check your syntax or validity of your code for AVS. But mostly because I have a very high desktop resolution and the text boxes look like they've been designed for a machine running a 640x680 desktop resolution :rolleyes: ....<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose I could just switch resolution down every time I wanted to play with presets and have my icons on screen rearange them selves every time. Or do the notepad thing and cut and paste crazy. <br />
<br />
But is there any other alternative that anyone may know of. ??????<br />
<br />
one last thing. I was looking through the code in some of UnConeD's presets....praise the lord... and I saw a funtion in there he used ... atan2(var)... I tried deleting the 2 and it effected the preset so it's working somehow. it didn't look like a made function and is not stated in the variable list....<br />
<br />
Is this something that I missed or is it hidden or whats the deal?<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;Hope theres some Answers out there&gt;&gt;&gt;:) :cool: :D <br />

<div class="posttext">Visualagnosia, Right now there is a post in the wishlist section talking about wanting to combine all the editboxes.  As far as I know of there are no avs editors besides the built-in one.</div></div><hr />
