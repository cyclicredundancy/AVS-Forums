			<strong>my first one here</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		This is the first time I've used Texer and Colormap. I've uploaded a previous version @ devart and fixed some things that people pointed out.<br />
...what do you think?

		Not bad. I'd prefer a gradual shift in the trail direction though.<br />
<br />
The preset looks decent and isn't boring, which is a plus. But you don't set an n value in one of your scopes (the circle button).

		Do I have to set the n value every time, even if I got the shape I want without it?

		Hmm, that is nice. I like the simple shapes and that there is a lot going on. Not just a single boring render object. Nice job. I just don't like the colours. Experiment a little more with colourmap, something like this would be nice ;)

		If it gives the effect you want, nope. But I think the default for n is 800 which is a lot of points.

		You might not like his music but he's still a great artist who's had a lot of influence on music. And unlike most he never got stuck in just one thing, which is also quite cool.<br />
<br />
Who cares if people think it's Bowie related? At least you're not being called UnCoded, UnCloneD, Unicode, or whatever ;).

No, but wherever I try to use it, it's already taken, so I have to think up alternatives like this one (stardust_zg) :)<br />
<br />
Music I'm into: Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Doors, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Therion, My Dying Bride, Nightwish, Aerosmith and many more...
