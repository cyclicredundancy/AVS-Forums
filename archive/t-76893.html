      What do all of you run as far as resolution goes for full-screen rendering? I'd love to run full-screen rendering at 20-30+ fps, at 1280x1024...Does anybody run this? If so, what machine and hardware do you have?</p>

      I run at 800x600 /w doubling on on an 800 and I get 20 frames/sec... I'd be surprised to find anyoone running higher than that. Check other threads for details.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm it seems people fail to realise what pixel-doubling is. If you run at 800x600 with pixel-doubling on, AVS is simply running at 400x300 and scaling it up 200%. It's useful when you're running in windowed mode and want to see AVS in a bigger window, or when your video card doesn't support 32-bit resolutions lower than 640x480, although I don't think anyone has that now.<br />
      <br />
      I guess it would also make a different if you use overlay mode. Your video card uses a smooth scaling algorithm for the overlay, but AVS uses a pixelized zoom for the pixel-doubling. So in regular overlay, you see a smoothed image. In pixel-doubled overlay, you're seeing a smoothed blocky image.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The speed of avs does also depend on the complexity of your preset. I got an Athlon 1000 C, 128 MB DDR and a Elsa Erazor 3Pro VideoEd (what of course doesnt change anything as AVS doesnt support 3d acceleration). So, if i run a simple scope in a 400*300 window i get a frame rate of over 100 fps. but as i add more features, the speed goes down and down. If you want a good frame rate you can simply add many transitions as one, just use the dynamic movement and try to do your effect with 1 complex dm instead of 5 simple dm's. It will run faster this way because winamp calculates the movement once instead of recalculating the frame 5 times...</p>

      <p class="post-content">640x480 is too slow, and my TV won't go any lower. 800x600 with doubling on works decently fast, and it works on my TV.:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey ya TV guys!<br />
      <br />
      Check out the following: use AVS in Windowed Mode at, lets say 400*300. Now activate the Overlay mode (you don't need to set your Desktop Color). If you start your TV Output now, set it to Video/D3D.<br />
      The Video Card will grab the Overlay signal and sent it to your TV while you can stay in Windowed Mode, work on AVS or do anything Else (maybe play Minesweeper??). This should work with most common used raphic Cards (tested it on my Elsa and on a Matrox Millenium). It's especially good for Live Shows because you can use Window based Tools.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hi there<br />
      <br />
      well.. 800x600 with pixel doubling in not the same<br />
      than 400x300 wihout doubling<br />
      800x600 with doubling has a much better quality...<br />
      because (i think =)) it interpolates reltime effects on 800x600<br />
      and not as 400x300<br />
      further if you set the color depth to 32bit it´s up to 30% faster<br />
      (yes 32bit not 16) don´t know why... just check it out<br />
      <br />
      bye<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Why 32-bit's faster.</strong><br />
      32-bit's faster because if you use 16-bit, Winamp has to convert every pixel from 32-bit colour to 16-bit colour EVERY FRAME.</p>
