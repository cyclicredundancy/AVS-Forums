<div class="posttext">Man. I'm stuck in a rut and haven't be making anything new or even that good for a little while now. My tweaking seems to have ground to a standstill. I have 4 originals, 1 redo, and 5 re-mixes that have sofar made the cut for Rucksack2. I thought I'd see what you guys could do for me. <br />
<br />
Tips, suggestions, mixes welcome.<br />
<br />
You can get my first pack  here (http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=101466).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">3.5-4.5 stars from me :)<br />
 Some presets are very cool(see Intro,Creation,Creation RMX,Moving kaleidoscope and the escaped superscopes) and some are extremely newbish(water bugs,missile swarm or twisting scope which looks like a winamp2 default preset).Anyway the creation preset is my favourite by far :) I hope you`ll create a pack with new presets to show your really knowledge...<br />
PS.Try adding a rotate and tilt DM to water bugs...it may look cool ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dammit, didn't attach the new ones. I feel stupid now. (I just commented on someone not attaching) :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
There's the rucksack 2 presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">dammit, someones done it, i was halfway through doing that whole atom idea, crap. Nicely done though :up:<br />
wow most of these are sweet out of the new one. My suggestion is not to sit around straining to get ideas. Do something else, go somewhere else, search for something that inspires you. Look around, look at everything you see in detail and think what would look good in avs.<br />
As for the first pack, very noobish, the remixes are the best. id give the first a 3 and the second a 4<br />
oh btw i got bored and did a remix of moving kalleidoscope ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm about to start on a true atom preset - true representations of the s,p,d,f orbitals - type of atom changes on beat, etc.  I'm going to have to break some rules to make it interesting in avs, but I think it will end up nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 21:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Make two versions, one what looks like true atom other make ur own way...ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 21:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The true one will be static though.  Since the true path of an electron can't be determined because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, I am going to make it up.  Otherwise it would just be a bunch of dots sitting there.  I think it will look cool, and if I can figure out something that looks good enough, then I may make compounds too with all of the electrons.  This is all theoretical crap, but it will follow some basic rules.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I remixed your Journey and the Starscope a bit. Hope u like it.<br />
<br />
Btw, i'm confused how you can put a Journey into a Rucksack... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th February 2003, 13:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Cool, thanks. Where've you been? The forum's being taken over by young whelps.<br />
<br />
Umm as to the journey/rucksack thing. It a very esoteric concept on an entirely different metaphysical plane involving the new theory of relativity and lots and lots of peanut butter sandwiches. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I downloaded rucksack and ran the executable, but my player (v3) is not finding it.  Am I doing something incorrectly?  Thanx.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey Howlmoon,<br />
<br />
you should try the FAQ's before the local 'wolves' get their teeth out. Besides its good practice to learn for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th February 2003, 07:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It was made for winamp 2. The presets won't be in the right directory. Look for an AVS dir in the wrong place. You'll find the presets and associated pictures there.<br />
<br />
Congrats on graduating and getting the job Magic.</div></div><hr />
