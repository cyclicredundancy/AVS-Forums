      <p class="post-content">A review for U :)<br />
      ------------------<br />
      <br />
      <b>Intro</b> - Kind of.....clavabuhlata....weird....I guess. But it's not bad! :D<br />
      <br />
      <b>Vortex</b> - This looks pretty good. I like the flow and colors....good job!<br />
      <br />
      <b>Shiny Plate</b> - Hey nice scopes! Reminds me of Jheriko's Triacontadihedron (which I once did a geometry project on in school) If there were some trippy colors in the background, it would look awesome. But the preset is already really slow....I'm sure that would slow it down more. :(<br />
      <br />
      <b>Underwater Miracle</b> - Hey nice bubbles! :p But I don't get the 'miracle' part. And what's that checker-like thing doing there?!?! Definitely an abstract preset, very nice.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Disco</b> - Hey nice discoball! (okay I'll stop now):D Kind of weird pattern on it though :igor: still not a bad preset.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Black and White</b> - That's a sweet pattern. Looks like the kind of stuff I draw. And that camera movement is sweet! :up:<br />
      <br />
      <b>Square Nothing</b> - Very very cool, although that orange and white blend of colors is a little ugly imo. You're right, very unoriginal..../me looks at cubed to death........:D<br />
      <br />
      <b>Two Meteors</b> - Nice scopes, but it's not much.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Enter</b> - A little bright and dark (at different times), but the rest is good.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Another Peaceful Night In Heaven</b> - Dude, you should have made this your dreamy preset in this 2nd tournament, looks nice!<br />
      <br />
      <b>Glow in the Dark</b> - Mmmm.....shiny glowing amoeba....cool....<br />
      <br />
      <b>Devil's battle arena</b> - Alright! That's really cool. The rotation and mirrors and everything...nice.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Lucifer's Playcards</b> - Ah, I remember this, looks good.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Glow In The Dark Remix</b> - I knew there was connection between those two! ;) Nice job.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Lucifer's Playcards Raz Mix</b> - Looks to me like "Lucifer's Pizza" :p<br />
      <br />
      Overall - 3.8 star pack - Not bad Deamon!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very very nice, some excellent work here. Some we're a little overdone ideas but the quality throughout is excellent. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Some nice work in this pack.. visually very pleasing... I especially enjoyed Underwater Miracle, Lucifer's Playcards and Square Nothing (cos I love cubes). There are a couple of wallpapery/tableclothy nasties in here though. Overall a very nice pack, very well composed presets.<br />
      <br />
      Pixelcraft: you did a geometry project on my preset? I'm flattered. What exactly did you study about the shape? Angles and vertex configurations and thigs like that.. or more abstract things like its links to the dodecahedron and icosahedron?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah we had a geometry project where we make a poster with a bunch of information on it about a certain polygon of your choice. Since everyone else did theirs on basic little things like a cube, rectangular prism, pyramids, and stupid boring stuff like that, I thought I'd blow them away by doing the triacontadodecahedron! :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey some pretty good stuff here! You said you took a long break to improve and it sure was worth it!<br />
      <br />
      I liked especially <i>Underwater Miracle</i> with that cool checkboard background and those bubbles :up:</p>
