      <p class="post-content"><strong>VSXu music visualizer (standalone application) 0.1.16b is out</strong><br />
      VSXu is a free, modular, procedural visualization environment for realtime accelerated graphics which enables its users to create cool sound-responsive visuals without a single line of code. New features in this version include dual-monitor support, gravity ribbons. It's also including many stability fixes and is one step closer to a final version 0.1.<br />
      <br />
      Might be worth looking at for you guys dabbling with AVS, it's pretty similar in a way..<br />

      <p class="post-content">that reminds me, the links to the screenshots on the vsxu wiki are missing.. i played with my soundcard's setting though, i guess that's also where my issue lies. got a standard soundblaster live and some nvidia gfx card, but i remember working before (didn't try the player back then though). will try the editor later today!</p>

      <p class="post-content">let me explain my vista "spyware" statement:<br />
      <br />
      when you search for stuff in winxp, it sends the search strings to microsoft - this is spyware. also, when you run windows update they harvest and send an encrypted list of installed programs and settings to microsoft - this is even more spyware behaviour, and they tried to keep this a secret. who knows what they're doing in vista - and in XP for that matter... I simply won't run vista, even less going to pay for it... one thing they're definetly doing in vista is monitoring what you do, and also slowing things down with checks for DRM crap in every file.<br />
      <br />
      Also in vista they changed a lot of the API:s, vsxu's openGL stuff is working but the code for listening to sound isn't.. this is also why sound drivers are sucky on vista right now..<br />
      If i make a winamp plugin or so it'd work, but winamp doesn't have as responsive FFT for visuals as we do so the visuals would suffer a bit..<br />
      <br />
      personal rant:<br />
      If this is easy to fix maybe I'll fix it for vista, but it's not as prioritized as porting to linux and the macintosh right now - I see more growth potential in those markets since many of the smart people (who might contribute to vsxu) have already moved there - many I know and consider real programmers+artists use either one of those platforms, or would prefer to if it was possible.. The goal for me is to create as broad a platform as possible for everyone to use to visualize music. naive maybe, but I wanna try at least :)</p>

      </blockquote>That's not really spyware. That's just for better service. They want to know what people search the most so they can make it easier in the future, like youw they added Pics, Music and Video searches in WinXP. They want to know what software you have installed so they can give you updated drivers and such. It's not too secret if they actually mention that they send data back to microsoft, but not personal information. I forget where, but I read it somewhere. They should have an option to do this and tell you clearly about it, though.
