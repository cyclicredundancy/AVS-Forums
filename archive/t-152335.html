<div class="posttext">Heh...you know in the 'science screensaver' preset where the screen turns blue and the error message comes up?  Well I took out the 'screensaver' part of it, so all it does is shows the error message.  I saved that as a separate preset - and then I put it on fullscreen and walked away.  My mom walked by and she saw this weird scary message and she was just like &quot;Oh my God what the hell is going on oh no what's wrong ah no!&quot;  then I pushed 'esc' and she saw it was just an AVS preset.  Haha she was kinda pissed but oh well :p :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol. And how about taking a screenshot of your desktop, using that as wallpaper, and then removing all shortcuts on it? You'd be amazed how long people will stay clicking on your nice wallpaper :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yep - screwing with school computers is great.  My favorite would be to add some auto-replace things to MS word, like replace &quot;the&quot; with &quot;fat bitch&quot; and stuff.  Really screwed with people's minds.  lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yah, i once freaked out my teacher (who was a shemale btw.) by installing this little joke app called &quot;doom trooper&quot; or something like that. Anyway every once in a while a guy from the doom game came behind a window or from the side of the screen and &quot;shooted the user&quot; :D She totally freaked out by that at first, thought it was a virus :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Umm, I did lots of that stuff.... let's see.... I changed the &quot;Home&quot; page of the around 5 PC's which some girls used to show a pic from Rotten.com (the p*nis in the mousetrap). Was fun. Don't remember most of the other did stuff I did.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My favorite trick was writing an mirc socket script that would connect to the socks firewall (which was a stupid program) and keep opening connections to itself until all sockets were used.<br />
Blocked all internet access in the entire school ;).</div></div><hr />
