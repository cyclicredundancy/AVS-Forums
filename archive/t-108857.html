      <p class="post-content"><strong>I got an idea!</strong><br />
      Why don't we all make a group preset, or a group pack of all these group presets. What we do is that, one by one, everybody gets to add ONE ITEM to the preset. Rules are as follows:<br />
      <br />
      1: You must sign in with the date on the preset.<br />
      2: The first person chooses what kind of preset is to be made, i.e. if the name of the preset is called "Llama shit" you'd have to make a preset that looks like llama shit...no really llamas do shit.<br />
      3: ONE ITEM PER PERSON! AND SIGN THIS ON THE COMMENTS!<br />
      4: You may suggest items to be added.<br />
      5: Let UnConeD or somebody do the superscopes, we'd like high quality.:) (J/k if you can make the superscope look good with the preset then go ahead.<br />
      6: Multiples of the same item is allowed, just make sure that they are exact same (i.e. you can't make 2 yellow fireworks and 2 white fireworks and say they are duplicates)<br />
      7: E-mail it to the next person in line, DO NOT POST HERE.<br />
      <br />
      Good idea? Or junk?<br />
      <br />
      If junk, admin feel free to put the padlock on.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not a bad idea, but it could be had to organise. People might want to change something later and such.<br />

      <p class="post-content">sounds like a good idea to me<br />
      but youd have to decide on a group name<br />
      becuase "artist presetxxx Rmx by karnov rmx by artist uberrmx by unconed funnyrmx by someoneelse" would be frickin ridicious<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm gonna pass on this, unless you want a huge 3D superscope mathematical object randomly dropped in to the mix.<br />

      thatd be cool as the foreground to a wacky AVS<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hahaah, no offense guys, but if you think it's an original idea then your dead wrong. We @ devart are already doing this and the system works quite well. Each member makes a new preset or remixes someone elses preset and gives it back to the "pool" where each member can either take a new preset to remix or send a new preset into it. After someone thinks a preset is finished and no one should add anything to it anymore. It is sended to the organizer of it and that's it. One preset finished.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Uhm... damn my english is bad :weird: :hang:<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, just to say that it's not a new idea, but a good one nevertheless. And if Unconed participates... well one man can make a difference, but i hope the rest of the team is as good as him :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Coned: It won't be hard to control, I remember doing something like this before and it worked pretty smooth. Too much anticipation though, that's the only problem. People bitch too much about somebody taking too much time.<br />
      <br />
      Karnov: That's why we have the comments. Everybody signs in there and people can see who remixed what. And you're in? Cool.<br />
      <br />
      jheriko: It's okay if somebody does drop a large superscope in, as long as it goes along with the preset.<br />
      <br />
      Jaheck: I may be stuck with the cleanup, unless somebody voulnteers.<br />
      <br />
      Atero: If it works with the preset, okay! Just as long as it looks nice. Nothing where you can just drop it in and say "Done" without changing anything else. :)<br />
      <br />
      Zeven: Why you say that? :( It may be a mess, and if it is, I promise to have this not be done again.<br />
      <br />
      Tugg: The difference between your way of this idea and my way of the idea is that we have a list. you just have a "Smash and Grab" premise.<br />
      <br />
      Please voulnteer for this, and if you do, please send me a PM with your E-mail address. If you want to do cleanup, please post that there.</p>

      <br />
      Well anyway, it works. And the work gets done too, without one draggin the whole process for days/weeks.

      <p class="post-content">Whats this going on at devart and, more importantly, how can I get in on it?<br />
      <br />
      The reason I say this is because I have a nasty habit of making a single hideously complex superscope with no good fluff to go around it, either that or I make a really crappy preset and then make it 'good' with some kind of 3d dynamove (which I'm not to good at anyway). Which makes me totally useless at doing anything other than starting or finishing a preset (the middle bit has got me totally stumped :P).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Contact <a href="http://l0tus-.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Lotus-</a> and ask him if you could get in. The Deviant Blend 4 project consist of <i>his</i> favorite artists, so i think you need to give him a link to your work ;)<br />
      <br />
      If the flag is green then contact <a href="http://evilrice.deviantart.com" target="_blank">evilrice</a>, since he has been handling the preset "pool" via email sending us the new versions/remixes etc. to each one in the project.</p>
