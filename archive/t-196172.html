      <p class="post-content">whoa, that's intense. I have no idea how you would slow it down.. az for zoom, put a roto blitter with no rotation and zoom that in</p>

      <p class="post-content">You want to slow it down? Move the performance slider in display/settings to the far right ;)<br />
      Joking apart, i also have no idea how to tweak the movement-code in order to slow it down. But since my first stupid idea will also affect all other presets you load, it would be better if you added an effect list with input/output set to ignore and put as much framerate-wasting stuff in it untill your preset is as slow as you want it..</p>

      <p class="post-content">only had a quick look: if you set a "set render mode" directly infront of an effect list it doesn't have any effect on the preset. Cause the effect list uses its own (adjustable) out- (and in-) put mode.<br />
      If i had another minute perhaps i could find some more unused things (37fps seems a bit too slow for this kind of preset) but as i said, i'm a bit in hurry at the moment...</p>

      The attachment actually has two presets only-- but in many forms. The one with texer is complete.......while the preset with the superscope is without any effects..just wanted to show it...looks like (nearly)a simple harmonic wave...so what say.</p>
