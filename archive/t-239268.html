			<strong>The norm for windowed performance setting</strong><br />
		
		

		Was asked a long time ago but im wondering what you guys use nowadays for windowed performance setting in AVS, Meaning when you go to the avs editor -&gt; settings -&gt; display, The performance setting there and not the fullscreen setting, Pc's have gotten alot better since I last saw this talked about. I set mine about 30% higher then that and it starts to slow. <br />
<br />
Was also wondering what any of you use for priority just leave it at default or are you setting it any higher. Any feedback would be nice. <br />
<br />
TIA :)

		The performance slider? I put it on one tick down from max (max seems to reduce performance :igor: )<br />
<br />
I use priority normal, there is no real advantage to higher priorities unless you are running something else that is stealing CPU time.. and generally it will reduce overall system performance.
