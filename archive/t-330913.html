      i'm often running into presets (including my own), that obviously lack some kind of quality control. so, i'm inviting everybody to share their tips on how to improve your presets.<br />
      <br />
      -test your preset in fullscreen: does it still look as desired? are there any glitches at the border or the center?<br />
      <br />
      -test your preset in various aspect ratios: will it break? are there any "wraps" showing in certain resolutions?<br />
      <br />
      -revisit your presets: are all effects still in the desired order (the opposite is a common bug). are there any disabled effects? are there any obsolete/unnecessary effects enabled?<br />
      <br />
      -let it ripe: this is against the "release early, release often" mantra known from opensource software. do you still like the preset? is there room for improvements? (again) are there any obsolete/unnecessary effects enabled?<br />
      <br />
      -credit where credit is due: place a comment in the presets, people want to know who made it. name your presets accordingly. credit everyone involved.</p>
