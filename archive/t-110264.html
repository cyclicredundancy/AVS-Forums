<div class="posttext">I'm not really sure if the subject does a good job of describing what I want to do, so I'll explain:<br />
<br />
I am using the superscope as a timescope for a sound analysis project. Before people state flaming about how the timescope sucks, I'm not trying to make a wild, trippy viz for parties; I am trying to create a visualization that displays the spectral make-up of sound. It's for research, not entertainment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have got the superscope all set up to draw two voiceprints (one for each channel), and it is working quite well. However, I want the superscope to move across the screen faster so that the sounds aren't so compact and hard to see. I want to draw a given amount of time over a larger number of frames so that the voiceprint is more detailed.<br />
<br />
I have tried simple column-skipping, and it really doesn't serve my purposes; it doesn't show me more information, it just puts gaps between the information I have.<br />
<br />
Here is my code for one of the superscope-timescopes (it is based on code from http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=106531&amp;highlight=timescope (thread this thread):<br />
<br />
Init:<br />
   t=-1; n=1024; p=2/1024;<br />
Frame:<br />
   t=if(equal(t,1),-1,t+p);<br />
Point:<br />
   x=t;<br />
   y=-i+1;<br />
   col=getspec(i,0,-1);<br />
   red=col*i*2; green=col*col; blue=col;<br />
<br />
I have designed the viz to run full screen at 1024x768, hence the n=1024 in Init.<br />
<br />
If anybody has any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reply!<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">As a quick hack, just duplicate the superscope and have the second copy draw one pixel to the right.<br />
<br />
You can use &quot;2/w&quot; as the width of a pixel.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'll mention it anyway: the data that AVS (or any visualisation plug-in) receives is a low-quality 8-bit version. This is done to prevent people from capturing protected content through a hacked visualisation plug-in. This might reduce the quality of your analysis.<br />
<br />
Though I'm not sure this is still how it's done in Winamp3, this is certainly the case in Winamp 2.x.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">zeven: maybe for the spectrum, but that doesn't explain why the oscilloscope data is 8-bit as well.</div></div><hr />
