      That's the first prewiew to my pack that i'll release in the deep future (in one year). There's some sweet-ass remixes (seems it is not really a remixes, usually I was taking a dm or scope from original, and worked with it, so consider these remixes as my ownes too ;)), i want you to give me the permission, ple-e-e-a-se, cause i want to release this minipack :D.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, i don't think there is any point in putting your remix into ED anymore now since you already put it out and it's going to be in your pack.<br />
      <br />
      But nice remixes, the duo remix was pretty good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well some people do publish the same preset in multiple packs *cough*<b>VISBOT</b>*cough* , but i think that's just plain stupid. So no i won't include it since it already is in your pack.</p>
