<div class="posttext">&quot;For me it is not important others telling about me. &quot;<br />
<br />
If that was true, you wouldn't have posted this in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is a bad rip of an El-vis preset: one face is missing, but other than that it's a 100% copy.<br />
<br />
If you're wondering which face is missing, it's the one where you fucked up the beat code:<br />
bfr<br />
ose:8<br />
=0.4;<br />
bt=ftte<br />
7767654gtvfrdhvt'';gfrtdsx<br />
<br />
This is a bad, stupid rip not worthy of posting here. Please come back when you have something interesting and original to post. That's about the only 'constructive thing' one could say to this.<br />
<br />
And this is not us acting like jerks because you're Iranian, this is you wiping your ass with the principles of creative art.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And that's all there is to say about this,except:<br />
Shabaviz, you always say you want to learn from your 'gods' but when they tell you how annoying your behaviour is, do you change it? This really has nothing to do with where you come from but, of course, it's always easier to play victim and act offended than to think whether people criticizing you may actually have a point, regardless of the fact that we're not always as polite as we could be.</div></div><hr />
