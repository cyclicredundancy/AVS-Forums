<div class="posttext">I think it's worth showing, small though it is. This is a small collection of what I think are breakthroughs in my AVSing, and I took them from their respective packs and placed them all together. Ideas, thoughts, suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sonic isn't working here, im missing all of the bitmaps. It seems you pack in the wrong bitmaps to the zip and what's that about the untitled.bmp? I already have one untitled.bmp in my AVS folder, please avoid using such generic filenames and always atleast use your nick or part of it in your filenames to distinguish them from others.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the presets look decent, nothing too shocking either way, but i like welcome a bit (would be better with some smoother reactions).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, sorry about that, what with the sonic not working. I put this together at about 11:00 pm (wow, I do go to sleep early...), and I forgot:D. And sorry about the untitled. Same excuse as before...<br />
<br />
Here's a good version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, I have all sorts of trippy thoughts, but I just can't get the DM's to behave. It's probably going to be heavily Texer-Based.<br />

<div class="posttext">sort out the zip file so it cna be extracted with out screwing around please..<br />
<br />
sonic needs a max blend or something.<br />
<br />
mass hysteria is okay, so is comets, the rest are basically poo though the colours are okay... the 'content' of presets is minimal<br />
<br />
you need to not include presets which do little to the music... if they look like crap anyway</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think &quot;Devil's Chessboard&quot; is my favorite one, although &quot;Welcome&quot; is quite nice in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
That Sonic one just begs for a remix!</div></div><hr />
