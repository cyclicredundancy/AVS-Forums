      I've been playing with the 'comatose enlightment' idea some more and came up with this. I think it's the coolest black and white preset I've ever done ;). Amazing on ambient and trip-hop music. Takes a few seconds to get going.<br />
      <br />
      The main drive is a finely tuned colorfade.<br />
      <br />
      What do you think? (One preset has a feedback layer, the other doesn't).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I think using a colorfade to simulate smoke is really not such a bad idea. You could imagine the red, green, blue areas to be different gases, which create a solid precipitation where they meet and react ;). Mmmm can you tell I had a chemistry exam few days ago? :cool:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Crap, mixed up the windows and replied to firedragons post here :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I like the feedback layer preset better, and another layer would be really good. Even better would be coloring it in (don't know if it's possible, didn't get into the details of the preset), then doing the seperate layers with the channels shifted...<br />
      <br />
      However I still think the same thing I did about your Cartoon Trip presets and Montana's Blossom - there's not enough action on the screen all the time, it just goes blank a lot. Is that fixable?</p>

      Pretty much Comatose Enlightment with colorfade directed toward the three main mixed colors (magenta, yellow, cyan), combined with unique tone (which makes the bright colors white) and inverted (Thus making the white lines). Not exactly special, but looks good anyways :D

      <p class="post-content">i like it, i like how it looks so simple but under that layer of simplicity there is a big bag of treats. i like #2 more than #1<br />
      <br />
      oh btw, steven, i've noticed a slightly change of style in your avs, you have started to make more simpler presets, are you experimenting or is that you plan?</p>

      <p class="post-content">My goal is to make nice presets, simple or complicated... I just love the beauty of the chaotic patterns: it's never the same twice.<br />
      <br />
      I've been doing some studying about chaos and chaotic systems.<br />
      <br />
      And this preset may seem simple, but trust me it took me a while to get that colorfade set up exactly the way I wanted it.</p>

      <br />
      And personally I think you should, umm, move on from the comatose enlightenment remixes...;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually I love this preset :). I put on some chilly music and watched it for a while... pretty mesmerising. Of course it's not meant to be a flashy/cool preset. It's completely different, and I like it a lot.<br />
      <br />
      But don't worry... enough techie stuff in the works :cool:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like the first one more. I think it's very cool, I always like flowing presets and these just happen to be flowing presets. Actually some of my favourite presets are your Cartoon Trip / X-Ray Trip presets. Maybe you could do a flowing preset in Whacko AVS VI? ;)</p>
