			<strong>Can I get presets from old version of Winamp?</strong><br />
		
		

		I remember liking a couple of presets on an old version of Winamp, which do not seem to be included anymore.<br />
<br />
I still have a folder full of old version of Winamp.  Is it possible for me to extract the visualisation presets from them and use them in the current version?<br />
<br />
The presets that I am looking for would have been from between 2001 and 2004.

		Hey, thanks for that.  But what is it exactly?  Is that every AVS preset ever included with Winamp?  35 files?  Does it also include the current ones?<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that I do not understand the AVS system yet.

		nah those are the default presets that were bundled with Winamp in those days. Save them in (by default) c:\program files\winamp\plugins\AVS\.<br />
There are thousands and thousands of presets, so if you downloaded extra presets then, it may be hard to get the right one.. But almost everything is still available.<br />
<br />
if you want to, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/visualizations/avs-presets/11" target="_blank">this</a> is a good place to start looking.
