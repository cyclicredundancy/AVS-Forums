      <p class="post-content"><strong>framerate</strong><br />
      Hello,<br />
      My computer is very old and avs runs with a really low framerate and I want to speed it up. I found something called render priority and put that higher and all it did was make my music jump<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to speed up avs without affecting the music and without having to download anything?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, the more modern stuff is designed for more modern PCs, and if it's really that old, it might be time for an upgrade. I did the same, and I love it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">btw hornet: installing a better graphic card won't speed up AVS, cause it's only responsible for drawing the final image onto your screen afaik. Even older graphic cards are capable of overlay and that stuff. (Look around the AVS forums, there are quite a few threads about the correlation between AVS and graphic cards...)<br />
      <br />
      And LnknPrkSKl: check if the "window performance slider" (found under settings/display) is already set completely to the left. If all that doesn't improve the fps enough you should really consider buying a new PC...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>Need a powerful CPU</b><br />
      <br />
      CPU is avs main source of power so to speak. Upgrading this will help. Multi-core won't help much, but speed at floating point math will.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Don't need much memory</b><br />
      <br />
      Yeah... AVS overhead is tiny... not even worth caring about. 8MB of system ram should be plenty for even the biggest resolutions<br />
      <br />
      <b>Don't need the latest graphics card</b><br />
      <br />
      Again... not important a 4MB card, if they still made them would be good enough... unless you wanted to use resolutions higher than 2048x1536</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know, that's why I put them in that order.<br />
      The first is essential, the other two are convenience items only. Prolly shoulda been clearer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Most people get this idea that a fast graphics card makes for fast graphics... its not hard to see why, but it means that we need to point out that in the case of AVS its totally untrue.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise some jerk may waste his money on a graphics card because of us.</p>
