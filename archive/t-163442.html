      <p class="post-content"><strong>Skinning AVS Problem</strong><br />
      Hello, This problem has been itching away at me for many months and ive just had it. Ive looked everywhere that i can think of, ive checked the forums (maybe not hard enough, but i have had it). I download skins off of here and Deviantart, i can see the preview of what the skin looks like, and in the picture they have it skinned. How is this done? On my old computer with an older winamp i was successfull... Im totally lost.<br />
      <br />
      I am using winamp 5 with AVS 2.8b, on a winXP machine. i dont think the information on my os will help ya at all, but who knows..<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.<br />
      <br />
      [edit] im not trying to make a skin, im trying to download skins that have AVS skinned, and AVS still isnt skinned, its the regular basic skin while my other winamp main windows are skinned. [/edit] hehe</p>

      <p class="post-content">at one point, the guys at nullsoft changed the way to skin the avs window. running an old version of winamp, it was the avs.bmp file. in winamp 5 (and the last versions of winamp 2) this was changed, it is the file gen.bmp, which is used by the avs window and the medialibrary. however, due to the different layouts of these two files, you can't simply rename the old avs.bmp to gen.bmp.<br />
      <br />
      you have to update these skins yourself or hope for an updated version from the author.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, i get it now. Thanks for the enlightenment. would there be a way in uninstalling the new AVS (2.8) and somehow getting a hold of an older version of AVS? or would that be impractical? i didnt find anything wrong with the older AVS.. but thats just me...</p>

      <p class="post-content">The new AVS has tons of changes in functionality: newer presets won't work with the old one.</p>

      </blockquote>I don't think that the version of AVS has anything to do with it. It's the version of Winamp that you should mind. Skins are a program-wide change. Changing a single part of the program wouldn't work. Best get the old Winamp versions.<br />
