		hey, this is my first time posting and i just want to see what the community thinks of my presets, ive been working with AVS presets for a few months now and i think some of mine are pretty cool, im posting my two best, they are completely my own, with the exception of the fact that they use elv-is' algorithms for 3D rotation, just tell me what you think, constructivly critisize, <br />
<br />

		Better than most first preset attempts,<br />
<br />
tornado racer runs a little fast and is sort of a wash of red. At least add a colormap and/or define the scopes a little better against the background.<br />
<br />
Use the force is quite fun but a bit of an experiment-preset, it needs to have some propper music response built into it to make it a propper preset.<br />
<br />
Some of the code is a bit dubious too:<br />
<br />
enabled=if(above(gettime(-1.0),gettime(-2.0)/2+3),1,0);<br />
<br />
enable an effect list only if half the song + 3 seconds has passed? er.... ok.<br />
<br />
trans/rotoblitter &amp; trans/movement-&gt;tunnelling are essentially the same thing, you dont need both<br />
<br />
Try not to use too many of the built in effects since they cannot be frame rate limited... and frame rate limit your movements becuase otherwise they will run too fast etc.. etc... generic noob advice... check the AVS tutorials for more
