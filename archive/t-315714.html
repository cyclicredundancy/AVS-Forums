<div class="posttext">I just started with winamp. Like it, but I can't get a visualization to last very long. It goes through all the visualizations one after another randomly. I have looked all through the settins and controls but haven't figured it out. How do I make my favorite visualization permanent, working with every album I play (until I change my mind)?</div></div><hr />

Question #4a: AVS keeps changing the visuals every X seconds. How can I turn this off?<br />
Question #4b: AVS keeps showing the same visual. How can I make it change presets regularly?<br />
<br />
To turn this on/off, you have to open the configuration dialog first (see Question #2). Then, go to the 'Settings' menu at the top, click 'Presets/Hotkeys'. Now, turn on/off the checkbox marked 'Randomly switch presets'.<br />
Note that AVS will never cycle presets while the configuration dialog is open, even when this is turned on. Make sure that this is turned off anyway when creating presets, because you could easily lose an unsaved preset this way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks. That was helpful. I have one more question. Using the AVS plugin it allows me to choose from many different visualizations. However most of them I have no use for them. Is there a way I can delete them so that when I click on &quot;community picks&quot; or &quot;winamp 5 picks&quot; it will only show the few visualizations that I like and care to use?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">They're in (by default) C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\AVS\ and then in their independant subdirectories. You can remove any .avs file from any subdirectory in there. <br />
<br />
There are a lot more (and better) presets out there, though<br />
<br />
just take a look here (http://www.deviantart.com/#catpath=customization/visualization/avspresets&amp;order=9) and here (http://www.winamp.com/visualizations/avs-presets/11/most-downloaded)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can also refer to the Help file [F1] which indicates that ScrLock will halt/unhalt the visulation changing AND that pressing the L key will list the visulations by creator's name. [These are &quot;hot keys]</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That would be for Milkdrop (I assume), not AVS, WTH. :)</div></div><hr />
