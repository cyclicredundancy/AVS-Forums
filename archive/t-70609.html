		Okay, I have two separate AVS files, here, there is only one AVS file in each .zip file, but in the future, I may have collections, (after I get more education in this AVS studio)<br />
<br />
This program has almost limitless effects!<br />
<br />
I accidentally deleted some things when I was fixing up my first AVS called Firework Nebula, and it turned into a new creation,<br />
<br />
Firework Glowers<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, the avs.zip is the Firework Nebula<br />
<br />
and the Firework Glowers .zip is self-explanatory.

		Not too bad my friend. Not too shaby at all.:) I see you are getting a feel for how some of the effects work together. You should keep playing around and release a pack.<br />

<br />
PS: Have you check got around to checking out some packs from some of the AVS &quot;elders&quot;:D of our community? Go to the plug-ins section on winamps page and type in a search for El-Vis. Make sure you check out his 9th pack called DrugDrive. I personally think this is the best pack the AVS scene has to offer. Also look up whyeye.org and Whacko AVS. The later of which is from UnConeD, a regular on this forum and one of the most talented AVS artist out there. I think you'll really enjoy them. :p

Thanks solamon!<br />
<br />
I'll check that out sometime!<br />

As a matter of fact, I have already downloaded a few new AVS files by some amateurs around here, so I'm sure I'll be right on the elder's trail before I know it! heheh<br />
<br />

		Not too bad!<br />
<br />
I dont know if everyone would really go for the psychedelic movement, , because so many different colors causes your eyes to go crazy, if you know what I mean......heheheh.<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm not everyone.  Everyone has their own personal tastes! :).<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, I like the graphics, and I would say it is better than the first one I released.<br />
<br />
I give it 3 and 1/2 :winamp:  out of 5 :winamp:

<br />
Okie dokies...<br />
<br />
Folks, I'm about ready to release my first pack, centered around fireworks, simply because that's all I'm good at doing visualizations with so far.  LOL.....Hopefully I can learn some more things in the future with this AVS because the effects can be astounding.<br />
<br />
Check back soon, very soon, for the first pack, with 3 files.<br />
<br />
Note to all who downloaded my first two files:<br />
<br />
This pack is the first two files, plus one new file.
