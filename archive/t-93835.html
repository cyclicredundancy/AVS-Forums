      <p class="post-content">If you're going to steal someone elses work, at least give them credit.<br />
      Dance of Eldarado (and btw, that's spelled El Dorado): Movement was taken from Justin's New Poop<br />
      Elvis's Freefal: I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that that was an accident.<br />
      Orange Crush: Superscope taken from Zen-X's Aztec Temple.<br />
      Star Wars: Superscope code (and possibly the superscope itself, but I don't recognize it) is El-Vis's.<br />
      <br />
      That's all that I recognize, but there might be more. My point is, at most, half the work in this pack is yours. Using other people's code without giving them credit pisses people off. You can get yourself into a lot of hot water real quick for ripping code. Think about that next time :hang:</p>

      </blockquote>The people who worked hard to really make the AVS are beyond credit and really know what they do.Hope I've not offended anyone in making a pack,well was fooling around with a couple of effect and well made something that looked good and thought I'd just share,nothing beyond that,it was done long ago.....:(:D.....then again you won't ever see anymore packs from me.....???

      <p class="post-content">My point was that even when you're just sharing effects that you've been fooling around with, if they contain code that was written by someone else (excluding, of course, the examples for superscopes), give them credit for it. And if you're publishing those effects, ask the original coder's permission first.<br />

      What did you mean by "the people who worked hard to really make the AVS are beyond credit and really know what they do"?</p>
