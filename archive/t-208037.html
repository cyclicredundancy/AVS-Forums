      <p class="post-content">Nah, it doesn't work like that. I believe there is a lot of criteria you have to pass for your work to get published, such as having a decent installer, and including correctly sized preview images.</p>

      by the way, UCD is only a moderator, not an admin nor reviewer and cannot submit preset packs for as far as I know</p>

      <p class="post-content">WotL is right, I'm not a plugin/skin reviewer. The basic rule is to wait... it could be you're still in the queue, although a month does sound long. I don't know how big the queue is these days, but my record for longest wait was about 1.5 months :P.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, it might be your pack was rejected if it failed to meet submission guidelines, was broken, or was of too low quality (although the bar on that criterium is very low). It is possible that something went wrong and that it is still showing up as queued, or it may have gotten lost.<br />
      <br />
      In any case, if this is your first pack, it is probably best to post them here or at deviantart, as you'll get much more feedback immediately and from experienced AVSers.</p>
