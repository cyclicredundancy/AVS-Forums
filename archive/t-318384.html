      <p class="post-content"><strong>i need help writing codes</strong><br />
      i hope i'm not annoying anyone to be in here as a complete newbie and need all sorts of questions answered but...<br />
      <br />
      this "expression" stuff with the codes and polarities and all the hoopla... i'm a musician but, i didn't get very far with math in High School.<br />
      <br />
      so, can anyone tell me an equation or code that will assign specific colors to particular frequencies? i have recently been able to interface my guitar with Winamp and would like to build a "lighting show" around this concept. any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      there was a "music scope" spiral in a plugin i downloaded, but it wasn't very accurate.<br />
      <br />
      thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay for coding help start <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=237854" target="_blank">here</a> aka the stickies at the top of this forum.<br />
      <br />
      But there are several ways you could change the colour of what you're rendering.<br />
      If you're using a superscope or texer II then you could use red/green/blue; you could also use a colour map.<br />
      <br />
      Read the tutorials, pick apart presets that do what you want/like and learn.</p>
