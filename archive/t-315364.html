      and more importantly is whether the broken presets with 2.82 are still broken in 2.83...<br />

      <p class="post-content">i think we all believed that without this illogically big picture!<br />
      and lucky you 2.83 crashes as soon as i start it so 2.81d is good enough since nobody will make major changes to avs in years</p>

      <p class="post-content">micro.D if it is still crashing on startup then why haven't you provided a bug report about this as no one else has posted about the v2.83 crashing.<br />
      <br />
      in all honesty AVS needs to be scrapped/reworked as it's a bitch to compile correctly (as using msvc6 isn't ideal). it also doesn't help that most apes can't be recompiled and that was where the biggist issue with the compiler change tried with v2.82 was coming from. and from what i gather there' no chance of being able to resolve that for most of the apes so its screwed no matter what is done with the avs dll itself *shrugs*<br />

      <p class="post-content">doesn't matter anyway 2.81d works just perfect for me so i haven't bothered myself with the newer versions plus i'm using the freeframe streaming edition for vjing and that's built on the version 2.81d.<br />
      if i understood well to improve avs normally in the future a complete rewrite is necessary even for apes but the 80% of their creators have quited avs or lost their source code so it's nearly impossible to do. i dunno all my hope is in fridge. i'll study coding seriously soon so maybe i'll able to help here and there (i know, really noobish sentence:P)</p>
