      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need An AVS Programmer</strong><br />
      I would like to make a visualization, but I do not know how; I would like to ask someone to help me. It would actually be their own visualization, but I would be providing the artwork. ^_^' I would actually own the copy rights and the trade marks.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to make a visualization to watch while I am listening to Win Amp. I was thinking of a very simple display of the artist name and information; running time in the display would be good.<br />
      <br />
      I will provide the type faces; the art would be very simple. The graphics can be still or animated. No complex mathematics are required.<br />
      <br />
      Processor conservation is a concern; I would like the visualization to be fast, and not over use the Processor.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to get started to work on this right now.<br />
      <br />
      This is a non-profit endeaver so I can only give you art products for the project. I would also like to give who ever helps me products from the project.<br />
      <br />
      Who ever may be interested; please contact me at my email address, <a href="mailto:ndrwglrza@yahoo.com">ndrwglrza@yahoo.com</a> or by telephone, 1-305-380-1456. I don't have chat right now, but i will get it soon.<br />
      <br />
      Please reply.<br />
      <br />
      Peace,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thank you, but</strong><br />
      This appears to be for some one looking to make a visualization; and I am not. I am looking for some one to make a visualization that I would design. I am not a programmer at all.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you.<br />
      <br />
      Peace,<br />

      <p class="post-content">AVS is a CPU intensive visualization, this is because it uses the CPU for all rendering unlike many other visualizations.<br />
      <br />
      I would suggest finding another visualization which can facilitate your needs or creating new one built for purpose.<br />
      <br />
      I also doubt any one on the AVS forums will make a preset for you considering the state the AVS scene is in.<br />
      Making it yourself is the only realistic (And most rewarding) option.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh. I wanted an analog visualization. It would be completely image based; excluding the type. I would give rights to who ever made it.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know anything about programming so I'm definitely not going to make it myself.<br />
      <br />
      [sigh]<br />
      <br />
      Oh well.<br />
      <br />
      Any one interested please email me.<br />
