<div class="posttext">I would like to make a visualization, but I do not know how; I would like to ask someone to help me. It would actually be their own visualization, but I would be providing the artwork. ^_^' I would actually own the copy rights and the trade marks.<br />
<br />
I would like to make a visualization to watch while I am listening to Win Amp. I was thinking of a very simple display of the artist name and information; running time in the display would be good.<br />
<br />
I will provide the type faces; the art would be very simple. The graphics can be still or animated. No complex mathematics are required.<br />
<br />
Processor conservation is a concern; I would like the visualization to be fast, and not over use the Processor.<br />
<br />
I would like to get started to work on this right now.<br />
<br />
This is a non-profit endeaver so I can only give you art products for the project. I would also like to give who ever helps me products from the project.<br />
<br />
Who ever may be interested; please contact me at my email address, ndrwglrza@yahoo.com or by telephone, 1-305-380-1456. I don't have chat right now, but i will get it soon.<br />
<br />
Please reply.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
<br />
Andrew</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This appears to be for some one looking to make a visualization; and I am not. I am looking for some one to make a visualization that I would design. I am not a programmer at all.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="posttext">AVS is a CPU intensive visualization, this is because it uses the CPU for all rendering unlike many other visualizations.<br />
<br />
I would suggest finding another visualization which can facilitate your needs or creating new one built for purpose.<br />
<br />
I also doubt any one on the AVS forums will make a preset for you considering the state the AVS scene is in.<br />
Making it yourself is the only realistic (And most rewarding) option.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Oh. I wanted an analog visualization. It would be completely image based; excluding the type. I would give rights to who ever made it.<br />
<br />
I don't know anything about programming so I'm definitely not going to make it myself.<br />
<br />
[sigh]<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
Any one interested please email me.<br />
