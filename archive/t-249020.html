      <p class="post-content"><strong>ref&amp; issues</strong><br />
      1. This problem keeps my folders full. I mean "crashing".<br />
      Winamp either hangs up with error or terminates. Regularly, 10 sec before it comes, saving function begins to crash, then the black outline appears around every drop-down list(not always), it's better not to try to load/save then, it never helps. Then, you must immediately press Alt+F4 to close AVS editor, it works. Then, you could reload your preset.<br />
      Maybe it can grow rarer if avoiding incorrect timers in code - i am not sure.<br />
      Also not sure if it comes only if misc objects added. I ofted experienced it when adding comment, set render mode, buffer save.<br />
      <br />
      2. The strange problem does also often appear - all texts in avs disappear - this can be reset only by wa reboot, that is very strange (how is it cached?). To the above: sometimes the similar issue occurs, but all render effects disappear, not only Text.<br />
      <br />
      3. Undo/redo history problems. Sometimes it stops logging changes - when the button Undo is clicked then, it deletes too many strings or even the whole code.<br />
      History doesn't control APEs' code.<br />
      Frequent problem - when adding a new empty superscope, 'Undo' deletes the whole preset. When pushing it the second time - rebuilds some parts. (cr&amp;p!)<br />
      <br />
      4. I exp this problem a few times on weak system. When duplicating Texer II object, i get something like -b/| in beat section, and a non-working copy. This issue is fixed with new release of Texer II (I will refer to Sticky: "...Texer II is a separate product...").<br />
      <br />
      I've summed there some issues that are maybe well-known, but i just give a list of them now.</p>
