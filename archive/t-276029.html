		sadly :(<br />
<br />
I just read through the two tournament threads: (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=139437&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=6" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=144893" target="_blank">2</a>). <br />
Quite some great presets even for today's standards.<br />
<br />
(Congrats for your Forum King status by the way)

		zip them up and upload, the the rest of us has it easier (there's too much material getting lost these days)<br />
<br />
edit: or better, release it as a pack under the winamp-forums account :)

		I've got them downloaded. I'll zip them up and put them on my server. If anyone could make an installer that'd be great. (wait a few minutes for me to clean up the filenames and such, it should be up in ~15 minutes)<br />
<br />
edit: it's up: <a href="http://warrior-of-the-light.net/dump/AVS/others/AVS%20tournaments.zip" target="_blank">[-link-]</a><br />
<br />
I also added the collections that were made after each round to be sure to have it all.

Wow there was some awesome stuff in there. Magic sticks out the most in my mind, but damn. Plus i got to see the godawful slow ugly ass presets that I made.

		Some very impressive work indeed. Though i have to ask why Magic didn't win the Planet X round, but instead i won it with that crap of a preset :o I think magic's preset was way better.

		Hyall!<br />
<br />
Thats bringing up some old memories.<br />
<br />
I was just by chance looking at the forums here to check what happend recently and wheter the folks that were formerly participating in the community are still active.<br />
<br />
Glad to see that at least some are still alive and even remember some of my work.<br />
<br />
I have not really made any more visuals since then, even though I'm having way better math skills by now.<br />
<br />
Studies and family just occupy most of my time nowadays and I'm more into making electronic music myself if I find some time at all.<br />
<br />
It was a really cool time back then and beeing an AVS Artist was and probably is one of the coolest ways of procrastinating. :D <br />
<br />
Anyways, hope you're all fine out there.<br />
<br />
If there's anyone confident with Delphi programming and willing to continue Hotlist, just e-mail me for the source code.<br />
<br />
Greets to all the forum folks!
