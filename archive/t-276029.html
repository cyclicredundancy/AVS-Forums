<div class="posttext">sadly :(<br />
<br />
I just read through the two tournament threads: (1 (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=139437&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=6),2 (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=144893)). <br />
Quite some great presets even for today's standards.<br />
<br />
(Congrats for your Forum King status by the way)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">zip them up and upload, the the rest of us has it easier (there's too much material getting lost these days)<br />
<br />
edit: or better, release it as a pack under the winamp-forums account :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah i was about to ask if all those presets were ever compiled into a whole.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've got them downloaded. I'll zip them up and put them on my server. If anyone could make an installer that'd be great. (wait a few minutes for me to clean up the filenames and such, it should be up in ~15 minutes)<br />
<br />
edit: it's up: [-link-] (http://warrior-of-the-light.net/dump/AVS/others/AVS%20tournaments.zip)<br />
<br />
I also added the collections that were made after each round to be sure to have it all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just spent 20 minutes cocking about with that, god damn those people that didn't put their name on the .avs filename. (http://www.stonedroses.co.uk/ryan/crap/WFTournament.zip)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Wow there was some awesome stuff in there. Magic sticks out the most in my mind, but damn. Plus i got to see the godawful slow ugly ass presets that I made.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some very impressive work indeed. Though i have to ask why Magic didn't win the Planet X round, but instead i won it with that crap of a preset :o I think magic's preset was way better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hyall!<br />
<br />
Thats bringing up some old memories.<br />
<br />
I was just by chance looking at the forums here to check what happend recently and wheter the folks that were formerly participating in the community are still active.<br />
<br />
Glad to see that at least some are still alive and even remember some of my work.<br />
<br />
I have not really made any more visuals since then, even though I'm having way better math skills by now.<br />
<br />
Studies and family just occupy most of my time nowadays and I'm more into making electronic music myself if I find some time at all.<br />
<br />
It was a really cool time back then and beeing an AVS Artist was and probably is one of the coolest ways of procrastinating. :D <br />
<br />
Anyways, hope you're all fine out there.<br />
<br />
If there's anyone confident with Delphi programming and willing to continue Hotlist, just e-mail me for the source code.<br />
<br />
Greets to all the forum folks!</div></div><hr />
