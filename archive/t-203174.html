		<font size="1">wow, im trying to find out from which language it has been translated literally. But i guess it has already been a mess in the origin language</font><br />
<br />
After i passed this post through my logical language analysis library i guess you have something like the following problem:<br />
You only see a color and nothing else when you start avs. And changing to a different preset only results in a different color.<br />
<br />
If so, i'd try to reinstall winamp at first..

		I know I've had presets look like they just don't work.  Then after checking 'clear every frame' in the main section of the preset(AVS editor) they work.  Still others work when you disable or enable invert.  Strange but true.

		Its not really strange, its just a crap broken preset. It happens with missing pictures too, and sometimes people make presets without realising they are using old data in one of the buffers. The foolishness knows no bounds.

		Then give us a pic of the problem. It should contain the avs and avs editor windows.<br />

By the way, which version of Winamp are you using ?

		The &quot;Overlay Mode&quot; can be found under  &quot;settings/display&quot; in your AVS-Editor Window. If it's turned on, try to disable it..<br />

We were just wondering if the preset is damaged, then avs wouldn't work properly.<br />
But the color you see, actually is the background color of that preset.<br />
When i disable the first effect list and turn on &quot;clear every frame&quot; under the main entry (top of the list) i get the same dark grey picture than you have. Are any of these things changed?<br />
<br />
Also there can't be a problem with missing ape-plugins.<br />
<font size="1">(some people make additional effects/components which are used to make presets)</font><br />
But cause this preset comes along with winamp5 this shouldn't be the problem.<br />
<br />
hmm tricky...
