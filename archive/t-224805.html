<div class="posttext">I feel the need to release a pack of sorts. It's been long enough. Some of you have seen a couple of these before; others have never been seen (but are worth the look!). I just took the best work I have to date. I welcome any comments of course.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hm, I notice everyone accuses YOU of being a n00b, Matt. :p I do the best I can. I will NEVER be a code monkey (or even 'decent' at coding) but, make no mistake; I have fun AVS-ing, and you certainly won't deter me from it. I will continue posting my new stuff, and I suppose people like you will continue to slam it. Constructive critisism is one thing, simply saying 'it sucks' is a waste of space. I don't know enough about coding to ever be a pioneer. I just make presets I think look good. Isn't that still the focus? Presets that LOOK good?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You've asked for critique i gave it to you, don't be a whiney little bitch, I look for in every preset<br />
<br />
 Aesthetics<br />
 Beat Reaction<br />
 Good coding<br />
 Maybe some user-reaction (e.g. getkbmouse=0)<br />
 Plain old copying<br />
<br />
that's my list of 'great' things in a preset, if you wanted me to say something thats a lie, I most certainly will not because I am an asshole!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Again, I asked for a critique. That is NOT what you gave me. Saying 'These suck' is just a fucking cop out. How did they suck? What areas should I work on? Is there anything salvagable at all in my presets? If you don't have the time to give a little more information on improvement, why say anything at all?<br />
<br />
No, not wanting to 'say something that's a lie' doesn't make you an asshole, Matt. You're just naturally an asshole.</div></div><hr />
