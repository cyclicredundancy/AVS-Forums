<div class="posttext">This is wierd. <br />
Running windows xp (and haven't seen this on 98). <br />
<br />
When I run avs in full screen mode for about half an hour (these are more complex prestets) I have a major drain on my virtual memory settings. I've increased that to 2gb and Im still getting the error msg. It doesn't seem to be making any impact on the graphics - but if Im doing a live show it could cause problems. <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen anything like this? <br />
<br />
I haven't had problems like this on other plugins/progs which are usually more graphics intensive. Perhaps theres some sort of temp file problem happening for some reason? <br />
<br />
Anyway Im going to have a closer look tonight - thought I'd see if anyone else had a cleaner solution. Ive got a big show 2morrow and Im going to be up half the night as it is. <br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, really odd i mean, virtual memory is in the harddrive and avs only uses the system ram i assume.<br />
<br />
Though im not a XP expert (i have only used a couple of times and i don't like it very much), but could some sort of a memory freeing program help?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only time a had a problem like that was when i wrote my BeatDetection APE. The first version sent windows messages to a window handle, not checking if it exists. <br />
<br />
This filled up the ram rapidly and after 10 minutes you'd either manage it to close AVS or you could reboot your system. <br />
<br />
Now i solved that but anyways, i didnt noticed any kind of virtual mem increasing (checked the resources constantly while debugging)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sounds like memory leaks to me... do you have some crappy alpha version of AVS 3?<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I have run AVS for over 48 hours constantly before with no problems?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its a wierd one alright. Most presets I notice that the fps slowly decreases for the first 3 seconds then seems to stabilise out on one set fps (generally a bit higher than the lowest point reached).<br />
Perhaps there is some sort of memory dumping although Im baffled at what? Could be pre-init on next in the transitions option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ive just installed milkdrop and Im getting the same issue... I went to remove a few progs and milkdrop is now a 178meg prog! perhaps a system reinstall is in order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ahhh...I know your problem.<br />
Windows estimates this based on the folder its located in, so if you have lots in your folder, it will think Milkdrop is 178 megs.  I think a cleaning of your Winamp folder is in order instead.<br />
<br />
use the edit button.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that makes sense on the program uninstallation cheers. Im still wondering about the vms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know when I keep my comp on after a few days things slow down. A quick reboot and it's back to normal though. Try turning off VMS. See what happens then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I get the initial 3 second slowing down then settling, I think that that is just the time when the fps is not properly calculated though as I would suspect that the fps counter takes an average of several frames to stop it from 'flicking' too rapidly between lots of values.<br />
<br />
Maybe your swapfile is too small. Try setting it to 4GB or the nearest you can. I've heard a lot of bs about swapfiles being 2.5 times your RAM size... ignore it all. Your swapfile should be nice and big as some software wont work if it is below a set size. Plus its handy for compiling quake 3 maps or rendering scenes using 3DS or whatever you use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Reformatting always helps. :)</div></div><hr />
