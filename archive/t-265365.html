      Here is code for an upgraded expression compiler. On the good side, it runs all of the standard presets. On the not-so-good side, it doesn't seem to have much impact on AVS, which makes all the work that went into it kinda disappointing... but at least I had fun generating machine code. :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      What it does do: Reduces memory accesses by keeping values and intermediate results on the x87 stack as long as is safe. Reduces re-calculation by searching for duplicate expressions or sub-expressions that were already calculated. Places the branches of an 'if' within the bounds of conditional jumps instead of creating calls to separate blocks of code.<br />
      <br />
      What it does not do (yet.. or well): Constant folding. SSE2/3 (MMX, 3DNow, and SSE are out of the question thanks to doubles. Not sure SSE2 would be much improvement anyway without parallelizing). Making sure all values on the stack are immediately useful<br />
      <br />
      Other caveats: Many special cases thanks to the awkward meta-functions :p Code cleanup needed. APEs that provide custom functions would need to provide STDCALL or (untested) CDECL calls instead of FASTCALL, and take doubles instead of pointers to double. NSEEL_addfunctionex has changed.</p>
