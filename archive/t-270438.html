<div class="posttext">thx man,<br />
<br />
i had quite some self made avs, but lost them when my hd crashed.<br />
<br />
I'll post more avs here, if i get the time to make some (Impulse took me quite some nights).<br />
Have to say, that its the best avs i made imo.<br />
<br />
Ill add a new version of impulse. Did some performance improovements, added occasional song title display and removed the starfield... think it looks better without (though its still included, but disabled... if u liked it, just enable the starfield again).<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">For a first preset it's not too bad, i mean it isn't bloated with effects and there doesn't seem to be any redudant things. In the updated version i don't think the text render is necessary so i just disabled it right away, also the red moving particle is kinda disturbing in my eye, i like presets to be constant in color and design.<br />
Good for a first work and it's good that you can do the presets you like the most yourself that way the most important audience, you, gets what they want :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hello winamp community,<br />
<br />
i have done a second plugin that i feel is worth to share. Took me quite some time till it turned up the way it is now.<br />
<br />
Everything is self made, except some of the texer images.<br />
<br />
Opinions are welcome.<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />
