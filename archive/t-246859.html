<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Let me introduce myself first, I'm the author of un-famous MOD/S3M player called Pervo Player from 1996 (Pervert player in english). It featured volume bars for up to 8 channels in adult manner.<br />
<br />
Now as it becomes 10 years of that release and that I've ended up coding only serverside-web-stuff I realised that it would make a terrific winamp VU plugin but I just don't know how to do it .. Unless I spend 6 months figuring out C++ and winamp ;)<br />
<br />
So for a developer who's got the touch I'd like to give out this idea for to work on. You can claim all rights to your plugin as long as you give me credit for the original idea.<br />
<br />
So long story short, I think that the following screenshot will tell all about the player/plugin :D<br />
<br />
[edited by Rocker]<br />
<br />
<br />
I will deliver the graphics material to the developer and I'm more than willing to have a conversation about possible enchancements :D<br />
<br />
If you're interested then please reply to this topic or send me email to: iso_eREMOVE@yahooINSERT.com (remove the remove and insert texts from the address ;)<br />

WRONG!<br />
<br />
Its not even remotely hard from an AVS perspective. You sure you wrote a media player? Anyway, play with Texer II and I'm sure you will be able to work something out... its really not very hard at all.<br />
<br />
If you want more help than that... try and find some other sucker...</div></div><hr />

Yes I'm sure I wrote that player but it was written in pascal so I have no experince from C or C++.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll look into that Texer II and see what can it do, afterall how hard can it be? The world is filled with copy-paste coders who have no idea what their actually doing :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hahaha, i actually tought about making a penis-spectrum at a time, but gave up on the idea because neither winamp nor deviantart would host it so no one would ever see it :hang:<br />
<br />
If the preset has to be like that one in the image, it's easy as $pi^e, but like jheriko said, find some other sucker :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i actualy find this censorship thing kinda funny. i mean its ok to have jumbo posters with chicks in their underware on the streets because thats adwerising but its not ok to show a penis.? it just doesnt make any fucking sence, half of us see a penis several times a day and the other half wish they would ;). yesterday i saw national geographic mozaic out a buffalos penis :D. <br />

<div class="posttext">Why would you say that hornet? Because they both use a relatively simple &amp; similiar way to get spectrum data? Pffft, it's just code, both of them are coded separately without taking parts from one or other, not that i would know of course :p</div></div><hr />
