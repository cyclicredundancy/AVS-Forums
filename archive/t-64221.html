      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Presets Slow on P4/GF3 System</strong><br />
      I am running a P4 1.8Ghz System with Hercules Geforce 3/DDR64Mb card plus faaaaast hdd and all the goodies. Yet, about 75% of the avs packs I dloaded cannot run faster than 10 to 15FPS in full screen mode. An odd one (crappy looking) will run faster but all the high-color stuff runs slow as hell . I am only trying to run this @ 800x600/32bit color for full screen which should not be too demanding for a system like this. I can run quake demo @ 65FPS @ 1024x768 so what gives??? What kind'a system do you need to run these beatiful presets in full screen full speed ? I am also using the latest detonator drivers from Nvidia but that ddint help either...<br />
      <br />
      TIA!<br />

      AVS only uses your CPU to run so even if you have a 512 MB vidoe card and a 1.8 GHZ processor AVS will still run as fast as it runs on your PC now. with my PIII 450 MHZ I run AVS at 512x384 pixel doubled. The low full-sreen resolution is the only disadvantage AVS has.</p>

      Hello all!<br />
      <br />
      I just got done building a Athlon 1.4, with 512 DDR and a GeForce 3 with 64MB DDR.<br />
      <br />
      Same thing!:eek: I get slow frames per on fullscreen mode, and 800/600 is about the highest I can get a clean 15fps. Which is still a little choppy on some of the high res ones.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way to solve this?<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Workarounds to prevent too bad fps (maybe)</strong><br />
      I had exactly the same Problems.<br />
      <br />
      Like ParaNoya said, AVS only uses your CPU. And there man fu..in' things to calculate while vis. So, don't expect rates like 100.<br />
      <br />
      But: You are able to get them <i>a bit</i> higher.<br />
      <br />
      On my system, i did the following things:<br />
      <br />
      In 'Winamp AVS Editor' Window, under 'Settings &gt; Fullscreen':<br />
      ALL OPTIONS OFF. Another thing i was able to do was lowering the res to <b>320x240 -OR- 400x300</b>(for faster presets). Unlike i expected, AVS ran faster in Fullscreen as i choosed 32 bit color depth.<br />
      <br />
      And as i switched my Desktop Color Depth to 32 bit, some vis-presets reached 98 fps in the AVS window!<br />
      <br />
      But thats not the End of all. I discovered some (almost hidden) options:<br />
      <br />
      In Winamp Prefs Window, click once on 'Plug-ins' in the tree view. Now you have some options on the right hand side, and one of them is a slider named 'Visualization plug-in priority'... his function is self-explaining. :D If you epxlore this window more, you will find some more 'priority' sliders...but i donwanna xplain them all, cause they didnt cause a lot as i played with them...<br />
      <br />
      That's all from me. I hope this would help ya a bit. Ya, i know, the resolution i'm using for fullscreen isn't that high:rolleyes:, but i prefer to have a smooth, responsive movements on my screen at my partys:cool:. Nobody cares 'bout the pixels which are a bit fat.<br />
      <i>Only Comp-Freaks will probably do so...but who needs them. :D</i></p>
