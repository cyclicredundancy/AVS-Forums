		This is a preset I made to see what I could do in AVS without knowing anything at all. I think it looks kinda cool, sorta like a moving, multi-colored, face melting inkblot test. Any comments, advice, or suggestions would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
P.S. Don't judge it too harshly, I'm newer than new at this stuff.

		Couldn't you have just set the title to something like, First Prest-Painstorm, but noooooo, AVS <b>NEWBIE'S</b> PRESET... grrrrrr<br />
&lt;insert flameing here&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;ps ignore above this line--------&gt;<br />
<br />
About the preset, learn how to code, built in effects are over used like that, everybody thinks it's cool just to throw a bunch of random things together and make colors, then they learn how to code and they find out how much other cool stuff they can make that hasn't been made a bajillion times before by every other living person. &lt;-Long run-on sentence

		that's quite well done for a first time preset.<br />
although you only used &quot;canned&quot; stuff, this one looks quite stylish and shows that you might do very good stuff once you have the skills to do so :)<br />
<br />
some optimization tips:<br />
you have a clear screen to black there and an additive effect list after it.<br />
As a first step, you could set the effect list to replace and remove the clear screen.<br />
Or you could move all the stuff from the effect list to main.<br />
-------<br />
Be aware of a bug in the avs editor!<br />
It sometimes arranges the components in the wrong when you drag them. it looks right in the editor tree but the effects are not applied in the correct order.<br />
To make the editor display the effects in the same order as they are applied again, simply restart AVS. (your preset is saved in a temporary file during that)<br />
-------<br />
<br />
@supertoast:<br />
No headache-causing &quot;strobe flashs&quot;, no 1000 components thrown into main, what more would you expect? :)
