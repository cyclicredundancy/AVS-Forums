			<strong>Back</strong><br />
		
		

		Not really worthy of a new thread.<br />
<br />
I kind of disappeared for the past few weeks.... just thought that I'd let you all know that I'm back and that over the coming week you will be seeing some fresh new work from me. As usual any AVS/math related questions can be sent to me by e-mail, pm or devart note... whichever you prefer, they will get answered now.<br />

		I know how 1000+something posts!  I really wish the admins would put post count back on the regular display.... :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, great to see you back half-sse ( ;) )<br />
(btw, I got the gta3 fix off KaZaA, realizing that if one person had a patch, about a thousand other people would too)
