<div class="posttext">Finally got this to look right...improved from the original I posted a ways back with a pack.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw...I PMed Steve asking if it is possible for him to add .avs files to what we can attach.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Fairly nice preset. I like the colors in the background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th April 2003, 05:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">the structure in the foreground is nice, but very distracting...it doesn't respond much at all, and it's painfully static.  the background is what makes this preset for me (it's really good, don't get me wrong, just that tower is...bleh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th April 2003, 06:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The background looks nice and gave me the impression of radio waves immeadiatly, but the scope on the foreground doesn't seem to belong in the preset. I know it's without it &quot;just another rolling wall preset&quot; , but could you think about something else? or atleast add some effects to the foreground or something...<br />
<br />
Nice preset otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">AVS Axer</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th April 2003, 10:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">niceish.. il say what everyone else has already said..<br />
the forground scope would look better if it was reactive somewhat, but i cant thinkof how you would do that without loosing the effect of a radio tower.<br />
<br />
also, occasionally the background colour changes to a 'pure' color, (like pure red, green or blue), and looks kindov oogly. <br />
<br />
other than this, very nice work</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmmm....maybe if I had a circle coming out of the top on beat<br />
<br />
(a la Whacko AVS 5 intro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st May 2003, 00:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">/\ That's exactly what I was thinking, except a 2d circle, and red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">AVS Axer</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st May 2003, 00:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah. nice one.. also make it rotate more &quot;harshly&quot; on beat.<br />
definately use a 2d circle though..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st May 2003, 01:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">rotate more &quot;harshly&quot; on beat...you mean more movement?<br />
<br />
OK<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm...I fixed one part making it so that it only skips the beat for the DM, not the tower itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd May 2003, 01:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">made three updates:<br />
<br />
*'crossbeams' now use getosc() data<br />
*main beams and antenna have better shading<br />
*added radiowaves (and I KNOW there is the colored dots on the antenna- I'm fixing that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd May 2003, 04:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Leave the dot. It's like the light to prevent airplanes from hitting it. I still think it would look better with 2D cicles (flat to the viewer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Limpet</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd May 2003, 22:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Overall its good, especially with the colored crossbeams and the ring. But due to my nit picky nature I found some bugs. (this is constructive critisizim)<br />
-Sometimes the posts would widen as they went away from the veiwer and got smaller as they come closer and even less frequently would get smaller or wider then when away or close to the veiwer when sideways.<br />
-Also the corners of the screen would bleed colors.<br />
<br />
It's still an interesting preset. :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd May 2003, 23:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">1. I noticed this too, tried to fix it w/ changing the 3d stuff--still doesn't fix it.<br />
<br />
2. I noticed this recently and am fixing it<br />
<br />
btw...how would i go about making the SSC '2D' while keeping it alinged with the antenna?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd May 2003, 01:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you could a) make the tip at 0,0,0 which would look gay.<br />
or<br />
you could make it 3desque by putting it in a 3d code but only using a circle instead of a sphere.<br />
then use 'counter-rotation' to make sure it is always facing the screen.<br />
<br />
edit/<br />
acutually scratch that. make your circle in 3d with no rotation matrix. Make it so its on the z plane facing the screen.<br />
because your tower is always rotating around 0'0'0, you can easily calculated the position of the sphere by using elements of the tower's rotation matrix as your movement code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd May 2003, 13:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">/\ pretty much. Keep track of the origin of the circle in 3D, translate to 2D then make the 2D circle around it. This will keep it the same size no matter what the z value is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd May 2003, 14:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok...I was hoping there would be an easier way...oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th May 2003, 05:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ehh...that tower is still really distracting.  no offence meant, i realize you probably put a lot of work in it, but either find something new to do with it or trash it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th May 2003, 13:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Put the tower on the lower-right corner and stop the rotating in any other axis than X axis (if im right, it should only &quot;spin&quot; now). Then use a couple of superscope circles that &quot;pulse&quot; from the peak of the tower and fadeaway on beat and use addittive or maximum blend on the rings...<br />
<br />
Something like that... it should look pretty good then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th May 2003, 00:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmmm...this suggestion will save lots of work: I did what Jaheckelsafar suggested, but it was all off.<br />
<br />
Atero: congrats. on the forum king</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th May 2003, 21:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">OK...made those changes.  Also included an intro for my pack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th May 2003, 21:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Looks decent. I'd move it either closer to the side or closer to the middle though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Limpet</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th May 2003, 23:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or make make it smaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th May 2003, 01:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The position of the tower is thrown off by aspect ratio correction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th May 2003, 05:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Fix it with a simple non-dynamic movement (such a thing does exist :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th May 2003, 13:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">To fix the aspect ratio i have used min(h,h)/max(w,w) and then multiplied or divided the x&amp;y values (or in this case, position values)<br />
<br />
The radiowaves preset looks much nicer now imo :D<br />
<br />
As for the intro, it looks pretty good. But could you shift the particle scopes so that it looks like it's in the middle of the &quot;cut out&quot; part? (not middle of screen) Good work on the intro :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th May 2003, 22:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, thanks.  I just fixed the aspect ratio before posting here, but will fix the particle scope pos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th May 2003, 10:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">min(h,h)/max(w,w)<br />
<br />
what the hell does this do?<br />
cant yu just use h/w</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">blazer1504</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th May 2003, 11:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I haven't any preset from you before, so I thought this is some n00b stuff, but man this looks grrrreat. the tower looks good, and the background isn't bad either .<br />
<br />
GJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th May 2003, 20:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice preset and cool intro :) Michael i hope you wont have too many remixes in the pack from ur last pack...I wait for some original stuff from you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th May 2003, 21:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">degnic: yeah- nothing yet because I'm working hard to make this a good pack.  I DID have some old stuff here, but it was n00bish, so I zapped it.  In my pack, most of the stuff is gone from my original submission here and the other stuff is fixed.</div></div><hr />
