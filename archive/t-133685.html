      Finally got this to look right...improved from the original I posted a ways back with a pack.<br />

      btw...I PMed Steve asking if it is possible for him to add .avs files to what we can attach.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the structure in the foreground is nice, but very distracting...it doesn't respond much at all, and it's painfully static. the background is what makes this preset for me (it's really good, don't get me wrong, just that tower is...bleh)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The background looks nice and gave me the impression of radio waves immeadiatly, but the scope on the foreground doesn't seem to belong in the preset. I know it's without it "just another rolling wall preset" , but could you think about something else? or atleast add some effects to the foreground or something...<br />

      Nice preset otherwise.</p>

      <p class="post-content">niceish.. il say what everyone else has already said..<br />
      the forground scope would look better if it was reactive somewhat, but i cant thinkof how you would do that without loosing the effect of a radio tower.<br />
      <br />
      also, occasionally the background colour changes to a 'pure' color, (like pure red, green or blue), and looks kindov oogly.<br />
      <br />
      other than this, very nice work</p>

      <br />
      *'crossbeams' now use getosc() data<br />
      *main beams and antenna have better shading<br />

      <p class="post-content">Overall its good, especially with the colored crossbeams and the ring. But due to my nit picky nature I found some bugs. (this is constructive critisizim)<br />
      -Sometimes the posts would widen as they went away from the veiwer and got smaller as they come closer and even less frequently would get smaller or wider then when away or close to the veiwer when sideways.<br />
      -Also the corners of the screen would bleed colors.<br />
      <br />
      It's still an interesting preset. :up:</p>

      <br />
      2. I noticed this recently and am fixing it<br />

      btw...how would i go about making the SSC '2D' while keeping it alinged with the antenna?</p>

      <p class="post-content">you could a) make the tip at 0,0,0 which would look gay.<br />
      or<br />
      you could make it 3desque by putting it in a 3d code but only using a circle instead of a sphere.<br />
      then use 'counter-rotation' to make sure it is always facing the screen.<br />
      <br />
      edit/<br />
      acutually scratch that. make your circle in 3d with no rotation matrix. Make it so its on the z plane facing the screen.<br />
      because your tower is always rotating around 0'0'0, you can easily calculated the position of the sphere by using elements of the tower's rotation matrix as your movement code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">/\ pretty much. Keep track of the origin of the circle in 3D, translate to 2D then make the 2D circle around it. This will keep it the same size no matter what the z value is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Put the tower on the lower-right corner and stop the rotating in any other axis than X axis (if im right, it should only "spin" now). Then use a couple of superscope circles that "pulse" from the peak of the tower and fadeaway on beat and use addittive or maximum blend on the rings...<br />
      <br />
      Something like that... it should look pretty good then.</p>

      The radiowaves preset looks much nicer now imo :D<br />
      <br />
      As for the intro, it looks pretty good. But could you shift the particle scopes so that it looks like it's in the middle of the "cut out" part? (not middle of screen) Good work on the intro :up:</p>
