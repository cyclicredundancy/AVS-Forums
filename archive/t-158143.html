      What's this about?<br />
      Well it's about me having to stand 50ºC day whith no air conditioning and looking forward to next week when I'll go on vacations to a beach!<br />
      (This may sound weird to most of you, but I live in the South Hemisphere)<br />
      <br />
      You may have noticed that my presets are all on the simple side, this is mainly because I have a crappy computer, so I make stuff that can work on it, and also for all the people out there with crappy PCs!!! (UNITED WE STAND!!!)<br />
      <br />
      I don't think I'll stop here, I am now working on some cool waves to add, if you have any idea of how to that, I'll apreciate tips!</p>

      <br />
      I never would have thought of that, I like the tree :)<br />

      Clever use of scopes.<br />
      <br />
      I'm confused as to what the thing(s?) on the right of the window are?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>the thing</strong><br />
      well... the thing is supposed to be two sepparate shots of the sea shore, one long shot from above and another zoomed-in in a 45º angle. Both of them merged together.<br />
      I don't think I'm making myself very clear with my description, so just take my word: the blueish stuff is water and the brownish stuff is sand ;)</p>
