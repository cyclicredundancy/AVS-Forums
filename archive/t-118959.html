<div class="posttext">I am trying to use the AVE from UnConEd to capture AVS and convert it to AVI.  I have the actual .ave file, but I am unsure what to do with it to make it work correctly.  Can anyone help me with this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For those of you who can't understand a word he's saying, he's talking about UnConeD's AVS Grabber APE...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">.. which comes with a readme file with instructions on how to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">smashmouthftbal</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th December 2002, 05:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The instructions are not detailed enough.  Do I put the file into my AVS folder, do I add it in as an transition or something.  The instuctions are not detailed enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok im sorry i got it to work, but to everyone who is still confused, take the actual .ave file and copy/paste it into the folder plugins/AVS.  Then, double click on the avs window to open up the properties, hit the + button, and go to Miscelanneous, then AVSGrabber.  Than, when it appears on the tree, drag it to the bottom.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Funny... anyone who has played a bit with AVS knows how to use APEs, yet you had a lot of problems even with the instructions in the readme.<br />
<br />
What presets are you recording for what purpose? If they're not yours, have you asked the authors for permission?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th December 2002, 22:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">and once again, it's APE, as in your immediate family</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have read the forums, read the readme over and over and I still don't get it.  I wish UnConeD would come out of his computer and speak some English Because I don't understand a bit of that readme.:p <br />
<br />
Do you need to have a blank AVI file? because I can't open any other output file than that....I&quot;M CONFUSED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">when you go to save it to an avi file you specify the name of one that doesn't exist.  It will create that file and save to that file.  It's really not that difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't know much about it either, I use the AVIFile library that comes with Windows.<br />
<br />
It seems you cannot save to the same filename twice in one session.<br />
<br />
The filename has to end in .avi.<br />
<br />
That's all i know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here is what I'm doing:<br />
<br />
1. I have my preset running in the AVS window<br />
<br />
2. I have the AVS editor open <br />
<br />
3. I added the the Misc/AVS Grabber to the top of the effect lists (under &quot;main&quot;)<br />
<br />
4. I wrote in the output file  box  &quot;Pixelcraft - Spitfire - AVI Version&quot; (that name doesn't exist)<br />
<br />
5. I left the output format the way it was (full frames uncompressed) and checked the &quot;Raw 32 bit mode&quot; box<br />
<br />
6. I clicked &quot;Grab&quot; and a box came up that said &quot;Error! AVIFileOpen failed.  The file you've selected is probably still in use. <br />
<br />
Is this supposed to happen? Am I doing something wrong or what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Did you specify the directory for where the file should be stored? Also, you may have to keep the filename to a smaller length(just use test to see if it works).  Click the browse button and type in &quot;test.avi&quot; or whatever. Then click choose and make sure full frames(uncompressed) is selected, although the others should work(they do on my computer). Then check the raw 32-bit mode checkbox, and finally click grab.  I just did it and had it work, so this should be correct.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*ahem*<br />
<br />
The filename has to end in .avi<br />
<br />
Perhaps you won't miss it this time. It's a known bug in the AVIFile library.</div></div><hr />
