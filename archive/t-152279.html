			<strong>Two Techdemos (for AVS2.70)</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I finally got around to playing with all the new avs features and I promise you these presets will be the last from me this week.<br />
<br />
They both demonstrate what you can do with some of the new features of avs.<br />
<br />
<b>Color Modifier Gettime Demo</b><br />
This one calculates the average time between beats over the last 5 beats and then colors the gradient acoording to that. The strange thing here is that at the beginning of the preset, the value for time between beats is very high and rapidly falling to the right level. That causes the colors to change very fast. I don't know what's causing, so anyone is free to help.<br />
<br />
<b>Global Vars Demo</b><br />
With the new global vars, you can easily make very complicated presets, like this one. At the beginning of the preset is a control scope, which controls the camera and colors. It also resets reg00, reg01 and reg02, which are the x, y and z positions of the scope. Every scope that follows adds a bit to one of those values, and that gives a scene, with movement that you couldn't do in avs2.6.<br />
<br />
I hope this gave you some ideas how the new features of avs can be used.

		Good work. I'm not too enthusiastic about the CMod demo, though it shows good how it works. Your Global Vars demo is sweet :)

		Yeah, sweet, almost like a chaos-theory-demo (yknow, the multi-part pendulum). Looks though like it has one scope too much (number 9).

Sorry, the placement of the comments is a bit screwed up. I can assure you that the numbers of scopes is correct. There is one 1 control scope, then there are a few groups of 3 scopes and it ends with a group of 2 scopes.

After I checked again, I saw that there was a wrong line. Thanks for pointing that out. I've attached a newer version, which also comes with correct comment placement.
