			<strong>3D rings like About screen credits?</strong><br />
		
		

		perhaps I should have posted here first instead of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=283729" target="_blank">there</a>  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any 3D ring visualization like what's in the credits tab of the About screen?

		You could do everything in that little demo using AVS, but with inferior quality (unless you wanted it to be slow).<br />
<br />
I would expect the answer to your question to be no... though. <br />
<br />
Try this though:<br />

		I have a copy of it in my collection. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I ended my AVS pack with a clone of the credits vis, if you like red and black it's great.

<br />
start AVS, right click in the vis window and a menu will appear.<br />
search through the menu for the file.

		Just tried it, all it does is wrap a visualization around the ring, not vibrate the ring (multiple concentric rings in the About window) to the music.  s_kupers' the revenge of mt. doom is a little more like it but needs 3D rings going either side of the resting point (positive and negative) for what I'm thinking. Kinda like UnConeD's Seismogrid does, but with rings instead of a plane.

		Okay, well how about this attached preset.<br />
<br />
It's a stripped down version of the outro in my crappy pack.<br />
