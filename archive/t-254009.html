      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS in linux</strong><br />
      i'm just about to install linux on my pc(i'm really sick of windows, been using it ever since i can remember).<br />
      i searched the web for a linux version of winamp, but all i could find was winamp 3 on devart. well, i really don't care what music player i have as long as i have AVS editor 2.81 :).<br />
      the question is: does any of you know a linux music player of some sort that suports AVS editor? it would be of great help to me.<br />
      thanks!</p>

      i don't know if it'll work 100%<br />
      <br />
      or you could use winamp with wine.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm using wine (1.0) to run winamp (5.541) with avs (2.81b/<a href="http://www.visbot.net/vis_avsmoddll/index.bot" target="_blank">avsmod 0.5.3</a>). both the winamp installer and pimpbot installers work perfectly and most of avs runs very well.<br />
      <br />
      to give an impression of performance, i used the intro from <a href="http://www.visbot.net/cat/VC016.zip" target="_blank">visbot #16</a> in 340x239 pixels (default dock-in-editor size). on windows xp (sp3), the preset performs at about 16.5fps. on ubuntu linux (8.04) i get about 14.5fps. not bad!<br />
      <br />
      you can use winamp and avs as you're used to from windows, for example drag and drop of presets works the same. actually the (gnome) gui responds much faster than the native windows gui (e.g. menu fades)!<br />
      <br />
      however, there are the same limitations as running avs in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2465005#post2465005" target="_blank">foobar2000</a>: texer images will not display!<br />

      <p class="post-content">having checked again, the framerate is now at 17.5 fps!<br />
      <br />
      another downside on linux is the order of the presets, which is not displayed alphabetical. i remember this was the same on windows 9x, where the order was based on the installation time - maybe something later versions of wine will fix (or were fixed in 1.1 already).</p>
