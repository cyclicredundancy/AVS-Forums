<div class="posttext">Just who are you talking to?<br />
WFC's are community projects. Nobody 'owns' it. <br />
If you want it to happen, I suggest you start inviting people, make suggestions etc instead of passively waiting, because that mindset won't get this anywhere. It's the mindset that directly caused the fact that WFC8 didn't become what it could have been.<br />
<br />
Speaking for myself: As long as I don't see enough people making efforts, I won't participate.<br />
So, people, surprise me. Please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally; I'd prefer if this didn't happen.<br />
<br />
Mostly on the basis that there is no AVS community, of any skilled value, left here. (no disrespect)<br />
With the amount of people around you'd probably end up with an EP rather than a full pack.<br />
<br />
Also AVS has far less of user base now a days due to Vista/7 issues/changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
If people do want to AVS could I suggest more of a themed challenge -- I know they've mostly all been done before, but it would be more fun to have people competing with each instead of trying to get blood from a rather mossy stone.<br />

<div class="posttext">WFC's came to an end there isn't enough enthusiasm in the forums. maybe a WFC bestof (a traditional best of compilation) or a WFC finalmix (remixes from all the WFC's) can be made. but i think the original procedure can be &quot;ported&quot; to deviantart because now there are more people avsing than here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">@ WotL: I can invite some of my friends in dA.<br />
But just a few ...<br />
<br />
@micro.D: well, this'd me my 1st participation.<br />
but as i can see, there isn't enough enthusiasm, maybe 'cause there aren't the &quot;daddy&quot; of AVS (UnConeD, PAK-9 etc..).</div></div><hr />
