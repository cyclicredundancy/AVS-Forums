		Tuggummi - tansiva mies 2, does the movement perfect. It actually dances, does moonwalk and allsorts, it's one of my favroute presets to watch on a fast computer. The movement just doesn't live up to that on this. I like your spotlights and the floor, they seriously seriously rule but the guy just looks... bent. Sorry.

		the preset is mostly about the lights, the man is just an addon.<br />
look at how the lights and the dm alpha blending is synched :)

		Yeah i just like the way the thing is 3D, Now make a 3d man out of those easy 3d spheres then you've got a preset. And make him dance good ;) I was going to do this but the idea of another dancing preset just doesn't appeal to me.

		Those spot lights indeed rule :D<br />
<br />
But if the preset is all about them, then it might be better without that distracting stickie man there, because... well it doesn't dance that well to tell the truth (and like others already said)<br />
<br />
Figure out something else besides the stick man, or uptaded it to dance better, or don't use it at all.

		wow, get your volumetrix out!.. seems its the latest craze. I like it heaps all the same.<br />
<br />
I'de make those spotlights change shape and make prettier colours, like real life ones do. All the colours in general are quite gay (imho). The man bites. The alpha blending idea is very clever though, nice work. If you made sure only one wrap of the texture is shown on each plane, you could synch the texture with the colour a bit better.<br />
<br />
i like it heaps, a nice preset is on its way.

		Quite a good remix, but I think it looks better without the multifilter, and clear every screen for the effect-list off and a fadeout inside the effect-list :)

		Well, no I quited trying to make a better version, coz the code was all sucked up. I had planned to include rotation and make it beter, but for that I will have to start from scratch :igor:
