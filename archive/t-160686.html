      <p class="post-content"><strong>Zen-X Rush?</strong><br />
      I really love Zen-X's Rush AVS... only it got deleted when I uninstalled WinAmp 2. :(<br />
      <br />
      Much appreciation if anyone can provide it. Searching "zen-x rush" on Plugins came up with nothing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That won't bring up results. You will have to try and download the pack it is in.<br />
      <br />
      BTW Rush isn't even a very good preset. I suggest that you download some really good presets. I would suggest getting all of the Whacko AVS packs first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Running on a 366MHz computer, Whacko's 3D AVS sets are a tad slow. =p<br />
      <br />
      Any idea what Zen pack Rush is in? I would hope I wouldn't have to download all of them and sort through a few hundred...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Rush was a great preset!<br />
      <br />
      Of course, considering what it was for its time. It was wicked fast, had this cool tunnel-like movement. Really fun to watch.<br />
      <br />
      Quite a shame that most</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe I have it confused with another preset but wasn't it a blue tunnel thing that doesn't rotate or change. It was OK but if you compare it with todays presets it kinda sucks.</p>

      </blockquote>Thanks. I was hoping someone might be able to just attach the .avs, but I'll try to find it in those old 2.x versions. ^^<br />

      EDIT: Got it, cool. :D
