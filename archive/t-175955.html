      well, well, well,<br />
      once again i decided to take control over your minds<br />
      this time nobody will escape me - i will crush all of you<br />
      <br />

      * WARNING: my english is very poor *<br />

      <br />
      ok, at the begining i want to say one thing - this time presets are rather poor,<br />
      cause i don't have too much time to make them perfect, but there is more of them,<br />
      usualy i give 21 presets - this time almost twice more, [with a bonus[?!]: some old<br />
      and unrealeased ones]. i was very happy when my last presets pack [electroshiva]<br />
      got 4 stars - i wasn't expecting this. some people send me mails with questions<br />
      how to made own presets - i will tell you how i do this. it's simple, i play with<br />
      different avs options - and when preset i made is cool [imho] i save it, so you<br />
      have to play yourself a little with avs, and after some time you will know every-<br />
      thing about it.<br />
      that's all from me - rest will be in my national language - nothing interesting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not bad, quite a few nice looking presets. Try not to use so fireworks and the bump so often, it becomes a little repetitive after a while. Also try and learn a little about superscopes, just a basic knowledge so you can move on from the default renders to make more original presets.<br />
      <br />
      Keep working. :up:</p>
