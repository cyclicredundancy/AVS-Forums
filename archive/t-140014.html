<div class="posttext">Does anyone here use AVS to VJ with.<br />
<br />
I'm using Hotlist with a Radeon 9100 and am having some probs with using dual monitors with second on composite output (ie projector)<br />
<br />
The only way i can get it to work is by setting AVS to overlay on primary desktop and moving all windows to second desktop to control it.  This is a pain in the butt as I have to delete all the desktop items and hide the taskbar to display properly.  I display full screen on second monitor but as soon as i click on anything else it minimizes again.<br />
<br />
How do you do it and do you have any tips or tricks (and i can't afford a scan converter!!):( <br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't know how it works with ATI cards, but with an nVidia card (use the Detonator driver) you can setup the second desktop (2) as primary (1)*. If you run Winamp now, the windows (with AVS overlay) appear at the second desktop (2). <br />
With nView Hot Keys you can move all windows to your preview screen (1). The Dialog Box Control is also a nice feature.<br />
<br />
*donâ€™t forget to undo this setting if you reboot your pc</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you have multiple desktops set up(one for each display), then you should be able to drag the avs forum over to the other monitor and then just run it fullscreen.<br />
<br />
It's also possible to set up ATI cards to work with AVS's overlay, but it is really difficult and requires a lot of tinking around until it works.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have ATI and I haven't had a problem with overlay, but other people have. It's annoying, but you have to set the projector as your primary display, move all your icons over to the secondary display, and mimimize the taskbar. Then you set up AVS as your background.<br />
<br />
Look in the AVS FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567) for more info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you could use mdm (http://www.muukka.net/multidesktop/)  so you dont need to move icons all the time</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You don't need to setup dual output. Just setup TV output! And it will work although your monitor screen size will suffer a little cropping. <br />
<br />
Also - if your running direct to the projecter - run it at 800X600 (which looks fine).  If through a video mixer - at the mixers settings (NTSC or PAL resolutions) for higher framerates and so your mixer won't crash.<br />
<br />
Install jesters linein plugin downloadable from this site (look hard!)and bring plenty of audio cable. If its an outdoor gig - make sure you get your own gennie otherwise you'll get power fluctuations from the sound systems which generally are run as hard as the gennie can go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Do the followwing:<br />
<br />
-Use AVS Windowed (you won't run it hires anyway) e.g in 400*300<br />
-Activate Desktop Overlay<br />
-Activate 2nd Monitor as TV OUT, use Video Mode<br />
-Run Hotlist besides<br />
<br />
This way you'll see AVS windowed, this just works fine for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm... thats interesting MX.. might even give that one a shot myself. Your quality will suffer though... no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah MagicX that's kinda what I'm doing but as my card doesn't seem to support overlay on the extended desktop i have to mess around moving stuff around and re-assigning primary monitor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Legohead: the quality will remain fine. As modern projectors smooth the picture themselves its just fine to run 300*400 overlayed to 800*600 connected via S-VHS. I always do this. The Image is bright and Shart and looks all good. At least good enough to really enjoy this on a Party where dancing peopels eyes regularly frequent the screen.<br />
<br />
Norty: I cannot really understand your problem. I used to have 2 Graphic Cards and it worked too. (Hotlist maximized opn the second)<br />
