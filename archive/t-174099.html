<div class="posttext">so i managed to make something ok, the first preset is a sliding texture-preset with a dm borrowed from tuggummi. <br />
<br />
the second preset is a &quot;nintendo 8bit&quot; take on elvis's &quot;the masterplan 2&quot;<br />
<br />
hope you will like them</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Didn't care about the el-vis mix that much, not my kind of thing.<br />
The Friendly terrosist is cool, but that dm is horrible! And you even took the alpha blending out from it, which was probably the only decent thing in it :weird: You could write something much much better yourself i imagine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">tugg, actually i liked the dm, i wanted like a &quot;sky&quot;-dm, and with just some tweaking it was the best one, but the alpha thing bothered me since you had it as a &quot;loading&quot; thing and as a direction switcher, because originally it only, switched with frame-value and just became ugly when switching, but like i said with some minor tweak, and when i tweaked the switching, the alpha thing wasn't needed. and no i'm horrible at dm's, so i would not be abled to something better, believe me, i tried many times</div></div><hr />
