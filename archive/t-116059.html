<div class="posttext">Four words.<br />
<br />
THERE IS A GOD.<br />
<br />
Downloading it now...Will edit post with review.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  REVIEW<br />
<br />
1 - Intro:  Nice visuals, only you lose the discs when they go off the screen.  4.5/5<br />
<br />
2 - Space Rings: Very nice, but...*falls on floor seizing* 4.0/5<br />
<br />
3 - Jello Cube: Does that come in Lime or Grape? 5.0/5<br />
<br />
4 - Radiant: Very nice, but not your greatest work.  Bottom of the barrel maybe? 3.7/5<br />
<br />
5 - Physhotropic Butterfly: Big name, big boasts.  Only problem: See 2. 4.4/5<br />
<br />
6 - Mission to Mars:  Best in the pack. 5.5/5<br />
<br />
7 - Milkyway II:  Better than Milkyway.  I like!  I'd like more stars though. 4.8/5<br />
<br />
8 - Retrosquares: Erm...Hypnotic but boring. 4.1/5<br />
<br />
9 - Containment: DIE BUG! Oh wait, I returned Metroid Prime already. Sweet. 5.0/5<br />
<br />
10 - Use the Force: Very nice, but goes through walls and pillars.  Sometimes leaves canyon and sight.  sometimes goes into the floor of the canyon.  4.3/5<br />
<br />
11 - Microscopic Metablobs: Very nice!  This should be called &quot;Radioactive Metablobs&quot; but that could be in the works already for 7...if there is a 7. 5.0/5<br />
<br />
12 - Zero G Maze III: Ugh.  It chooses it as soon as it leaves the tunnel.  BORING!  And Circle?  Okay, something other than a square as it's predecessor (sp?). More tech involved.  4.8/5<br />
<br />
13 - Circut City: Very nice!  too bad there's only Four different objects in the scene, but they look nice.  Hi-qual.  5.0/5<br />
<br />
14 - Intergalactic Octopus: Nicely done, second best in pack. 5.2/5<br />
<br />
15 - Strange Recursion: Just as the name suggests.  Veru strange. 3.8/5<br />
<br />
Overview: Well made pack, Very techical, but running low on high-quality ideas.  5.02/5 Average, My call 4.99/5<br />
<br />
Btw, it installed a few new fonts in my machine, but I didn't see them used in the packs.  WTF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st December 2002, 04:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Quick reply because IE just crashed and I lost my big post which I don't feel like typing again...<br />
<br />
- The font is used in the intro (Eurostile). It installs both the bold and normal version of it.<br />
<br />
- I think the presets are still pretty non-epileptic, but you could always add motion blur if you wanted. Oh and changing the buffer-restore in psychobutterfly from XOR to Additive makes it a lot smoother.<br />
<br />
- Jello Cube: add channelshift for more different colours :)<br />
<br />
- Radiant: strange, no-one seems to like this preset. I love it :weird:<br />
<br />
- Use the force: the ship isn't supposed to hit things but the prediction isn't perfect. It can't be going inside the floor, it's probably the non-perspectiveness of 3D DM's that's screwing up the perspective up close. Making presets like this is not easy... can't believe you gave it less than psychobutterly btw.<br />
<br />
- Circuit City: actually there are 5 objects and variations of chips (pins on 4 sides or pins on 2 sides). Adding more would add more slowdown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for doing a preset by preset review! You seem to have forgot geisser though... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I forgot the geiss one but I don't want to review it since all geiss ones are all the same:  A superscope in multiple forms (Circle, square, two lines, etc.) with a colorfade blur.  The blurs are different, the shapes are different, but they're all basically the same.<br />
<br />
UTF was scored less than butterfly because of technicalities (i.e. camera and ship going into the canyon bottom)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st December 2002, 21:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well the camera and ship *can't* go into the bottom... their vertical position is limited by a max() statement. Perspective can look weird from up close, because DM's weren't made for 3D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Xion(810)</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st December 2002, 22:07</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well the camera actually &quot;Sticks&quot; to the bottom of the canyon.  I don't know why, but it just does. It goes a touch under and sticks there.  I think that max() vars are for the top and maybe min() vars are for the bottom...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st December 2002, 22:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well actually no...<br />
<br />
If you want a value to stay above a certain other, you use: max(limit,value); At the bottom, we want the y coordinate to stay above the plane's y coordinate, so we have: y=max(yplane,yship); (not literal code).<br />
<br />
Here's the code for the camera (capped at -0.29)<br />
<br />
oy=max(-.29,oy);<br />
<br />
And here's the code for the floor:<br />
<br />
k=if(above(iy,.3),(oy+.3)/dy2,0);<br />
<br />
As you can see, the plane has the equation y=-0.3 (don't mind the opposed signs, it's because of an optimization)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sure, but it's just a linear gradient like you could create with any paint program :). The slope of the gradient matters a lot by the way... if you change it using gamma correction, you can get different results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) I liked radiant, I thought it was really good, maybe not the technical complexity that we are all used to in Whacko AVS, but it looks great.<br />
2.) I hate space rings, its the token crap preset of the pack in my mind. Sorry dude.<br />
3.) One day I will equal your technical skill UnConeD... one day.<br />

how come you are spreading a copyrighted font without permission? each version of the Eurostile font costs US $21.<br />

<div class="posttext">as usual an awsome pack :D. My favorites are <br />
Mision to mars (the best preset in the pack ), <br />
Intro (one thing tho why is the text so big), <br />
Z.G. maze (circular tunnels are better), <br />
circuit board (the chips sometimes cross each other, not good:) ,but probably hard to do otherwise),  <br />
the contained thingie (great use of DMs, love it), <br />
the starfish thingie (damn you and those tentacles :D, great one especialy the streched starfiled-great idea) , <br />
yello cube (like it a lot, all of it. have a sugestion here :could you make it so that difrent sounds deform it diferently-low freq. make it rounder, high freq. make it spikyer?). <br />
<br />
And those APEs are the best thing that happend to AVS since v2.5 great work. <br />
(ok the convolution filter was nice to:P)<br />
<br />
And I was also wondering about the font thingie.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I hoped that I can use the texer to have different flying pics. Unfortunatly it didn't work out. Is there any documentation available for the texer? Are my following observations correct?<br />
<br />
- every drawn pixel is replaced by the image selected n texer =&gt; you must 'clear every frame' as otherwise all pixel are calculated again :( <br />
<br />
- it's impossible to link certain Superscopes to special texers, e.g. first SuperScope gives a sun, second a moon, third a face, while the rest is used as normal to draw lines. :(<br />
<br />
Do you think it's possible to have a real combination of SuperScope and an associated image? I might have an idea, but I can't program APEs (whatever they are).<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Diesto: You can link certain Superscopes to special texers using effect lists or/and buffer saves.<br />
<br />
I have a sugestion for texer. It would be really cool if it could use avs buffer source as a texture except a bmp. This schouldnt be hard to do - Cfp used something like this in his videodelay.ape so you could just copy part of code from there.<br />
<br />
btw I found out what coused that crash whith colormap. Its using on beat random whith only one map enabeled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd December 2002, 13:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">CFP used his own buffers, not avs's, because they are inaccessible to APEs.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER!<br />
<br />
There could be a 'Texer Buffer Save' APE, which saves the frame to a buffer the normal texer could access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Stupid fonts licensing thingies. I got a mail from the people from URW asking me where I got the license too.<br />
<br />
If the font ended up on my harddrive and it's not made by MS/Monotype then I assume I downloaded it from somewhere for free :P. I sure as hell didn't pay $21 for it.<br />
<br />
Expect an updated version without Eurostile, unless I can arrange something.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, you can just use multiple instances of the texer in separate effect lists... if you set it to one particle and draw one dot using a SSC, you shouldn't get too much of a slowdown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd December 2002, 16:57</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Whey, the font-licensing issues are over. The friendly people at URW++ granted me a sponsored license for Eurostile, in return for a short mention of them in the readme file. Check their Website (http://www.urwpp.de/english/home.html) if you're interested in fonts, they're really friendly as opposed to most companies that have anything to do with copyright :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
I submitted an updated version with the new info, in case you're wondering why it's disappeared from Winamp.com again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Um Xion... the camera is still above the floor. If it weren't, the bottom row of glowing lights wouldn't go from center to bottom-left/bottom-right, but they would point slightly upwards on the outside. The camera is very *close* to the bottom, but it's not below it. If it were, you'd see nothing but the floor and not the sides of the canyon (plus any superscopes of course).<br />
<br />
Since the glowing lights represent the sides, there's nothing wrong with the perspective and I have no idea why you're complaining. And I already said that if it bothers you, you can edit the -0.29 value to something closer to zero in the DM code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ahh okie...But still it does go down there and STICKS to the bottom.  Watch the preset for a while and you may see what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">And how is that a bug? The camera's movement goes below the floor before being clipped, which causes it to 'stick' to the bottom. I thought it was neat. You can fix this by tweaking 'oy' if you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I thought it was a lot better than having it 'bounce back' or never follow the bottom.<br />
<br />
Bug means a serious problem recognisable to all, not a flaw from the perspective of a select group/one person.</div></div><hr />
