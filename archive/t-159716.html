      <p class="post-content">Wow, that is damn clean code you've got there.<br />
      <br />
      Put linesize=4-z; just above the line: z=if(below(z,.01),assign(skip,1),1/z); :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">i started doing that once.<br />
      Is quite tricky to work out how to implement the extra rotation matrices, and how to refer to points by their new position, after rotation.<br />
      <br />
      You need to be able to express each squares current position in relation to its origianl position. Get hard on the head after a while.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice job Jaak, I love cubes, :). I had made something like this, but I am using it in my morphing cubes preset so I am going to say mine is better :D. Looking at your code, I think you are using something like 17 or 18 points for each cube, I don't know if that is required because of how the scope works, but you can make cubes with two-three points less then that, (can't exactly remember how I did it, but I know the numbers are something like that).<br />

      <p class="post-content">bah, yes, i can do it with 16 points... just noticed :P<br />
      i could do cube with only 15 points but with this scope i need one extra for moving from one cube to another</p>
