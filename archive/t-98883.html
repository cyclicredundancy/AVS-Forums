It's entered the Winamp3 components queue... tried to add it as Winamp2 plugin too but it freaked on me. Ah well :p.<br />
<br />
Enjoy and please comment! :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:D One word describes the whole AVS pack.  Actually the word &quot;wow&quot; seems too weak to describe your pack.  You seriously ought to think about getting a job working with animated space scenes.  <br />
<br />
Have you ever seen Titan A.E.?  (It's been out for quite a long time, so you'll probably have to rent it.  I'm not sure if movies made in the USA are available in Europe or not, but I hope so.  It's a cool movie.  Your preset 05 Speeder 3K kind of reminded me of a scene from that movie.<br />
<br />
Both Tie Tunnel presets were great!  I wanted to laugh thinking of them shooting at Luke.<br />
<br />
Water Cube was quite impressive.  Really reminded me of Bryce.  I *almost* want to laugh at your usage of the word &quot;simple!&quot;  :D<br />
<br />
Zero G Maze II---&quot;Which tunnel!?!  Which one!?!  The insanely cool one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which insanely cool one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know!  They all look insanely cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Reflectocube:  You seriously ought to go into making screen savers!  It'd be nice if there could a program to convert AVS files into a regular screen saver (not one that's based on .avi files...one that actually performs the calculations as it goes).  That'd be pretty hard, though.<br />
<br />
Digital Nebulae: kind of reminds me of the Aurora Borealis from Whacko AVS Pack III---inspiring and incredibly groovy (I'm seriously getting into the problem of not descriptive enough words)<br />
<br />
Source II---outstanding ripples.  That ripple effect would make an outstanding dance floor.<br />
<br />
Of course it's 5+ star material.  (Not surprising-probably 5+++ or more)<br />
<br />
I can't believe it's actually here!  No joke!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow, good job on most of those presets... I say most, because, on a few, there was just TOO MUCH GOING ON to look nice, ie. reflective cube, water cube, and mercury. Apart from those 3, the pack was great!<br />
<br />
PS. These judgements are all based on my opinion alone, and therefor have no value.</div></div><hr />

but i am a firm believer that you shouldn't sell your soul for anything. (including but not limited to mad avs skillz)<br />

i am shocked that anything like this could come from a mere human; i commend you for your valiant effort from saving mankind from boring presets<br />

Nic01 said what I was thinking when I was downloading this :P Whacko 4 was more than good enough for a DD, so, assuming Whacko 5 is better...<br />
<br />
Which it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not holding back, and I will say what I think.<br />
<br />
Watercube sucks...It is too jumpy...the surface is cool but the seeing it SUCKS. :down: <br />
<br />
Mister Happy...See above. :down:<br />
 <br />
Mercury...I don't really like it. :down: <br />
<br />
Speeder 3K...What superscope is the lightning effect?  I'd like to use it.:up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh well, no way to please everyone :).<br />
<br />
Now of course the obvious reply to Xion is: could you do better? :rolleyes: :D<br />
<br />
By the way the scopes in Speeder 3K have labels in the init code... you should easily find the lightning ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Is it just me or is the Roller Coaster a little weird? I seem to be noticing little jumps in the camera position every now and again, and sometimes it appears as if the track you see a little in front of you (like around a curve) isn't acutally the track you go on. Or is it just me? Also, is it dynamically generated? (I don't THINK so, but never hurts to ask... ;) )<br />
I really like this pack though... makes me feel stupid, which is a very good thing sometimes... ;);)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay-sure I've been tied up with school for a while, but what'd I miss?!?  First of all, where'd that avatar come from, Steven?  It's too cool, but what'd you use to make it?  Hey-even from someone who's straight, I thought the original fat Mr. Happy was hilarious.  It's just the bowling pin effect where it looks like he's about to fall constantly, and you're just waiting for someone or something to come hit him and knock him---the same thing discussed in your old thread Mr. Happy.<br />
<br />
Rova:  Mrs. Happy?  That I would have to see.  It'd be funnier if you could put both of them together and call it &quot;Straight Mr. &amp; Mrs. Happy,&quot; but that'd be way to slow of a framerate.  I think the combination of &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; in the same name would be somewhat funny (but odd I must admit).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I made this avatar just like the Mr Happy one... using AVS and AVSGrabber. The preset is attached if you're interested. Though the one I used for my avatar was sightly modified so that it would loop.<br />
It's based on the Béziér curve preset I made (see 'Lamé curve' thread).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Xion: could you do better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Easy.  Remove this line: pt=pt+50*max(0,getspec(0,.1,0)*3-1.5);<br />
bt=1  from the Beat area of the DM.  This was my number 1 problem with both Mr. Happy and Watercube.  Mercury I can't fix...people like it and people don't: Face it.<br />
<br />
Below is my remix of Watercube, as can be an addon to Whacko V.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Heh a remix is usually more than just removing one line of code :D.<br />
I thought it was too boring without the onbeat, that's why I made it jumpy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent work man! You beat the guys who make the darn code!<br />
<br />
I really didn't like mercury though, just didn't like the concept :igor: <br />
<br />
My favorite was definately Speeder3k, with the Neon Coaster second. Mr. Happy was also very impressive. :up: I do think Neon Coaster looks better clearing every frame though. The blur just doesn't appeal to me :/<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work man!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice Work!<br />
<br />
I usually don't like presets with are based an lots of long formula's<br />
For me, it's more the effects you give it, perhaps that's why I don't really like Neon Coaster, Basically it's just one SScope, no more, no less. <br />
<br />
I LOVE the two cubes, they're a real nice piece of work!<br />
Speeder 3k looks pretty nice too, although the actual &quot;speeder&quot; is just some lines in a ralistic environment, but I cant' blame you for that: A realistic plane would just ask too much of AVS, or you must have a 15 GHz processor... <br />

<div class="posttext">BTW, I was just wondering... <br />
<br />
How many presets have you guys all made 'till today?<br />
I made about 250 over (about) the past 2, 2.5 years...<br />
The results are downloadable at this forum.<br />

<div class="posttext">man, just saw this thread and thought i'd say that whacko v is excellent, like 4,3 2 and 1 before it... how ever what ruins it all is the dynamic movement, that crappy blocky griddy effect is such a big fat nuisance and ruins a good deal of otherwise spectacular effects... i'm sure that many of the presets would look a good deal better if it wasn't for that crappy bug.....<br />
<br />
i give whacko v my personal :up: <br />

go download it now!!!</div></div><hr />
