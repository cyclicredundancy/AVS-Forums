      <p class="post-content"><strong>a little something</strong><br />
      not finished i know, needs a background or something (any suggestions?), but i'm a little stuck so i thought i'd just show you guys how i'm travelling.<br />
      i tried to do some funky getosc work with this to filter out just the bass end.. i think it went alright. that and i stumbled across some nice colouring which gives a slight holographic effect.<br />
      please tell me what you think!</p>
