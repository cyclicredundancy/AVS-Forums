		Here<br />
now it wont go black<br />
<br />
I changed the dm and not the cmod. Now the movements arent as zoomy, and they are constantly morphing from one to the next. Nicer i think.

		Personal self relief? Uhm... im not quite sure what you're talking about and not quite sure how my simple analyzer presets i like to do has anything to do with that :igor:<br />
<br />
Anyway, i doubt many of you, or shall i say any of you do avs just to please others. My first goal always is to please myself, not others. <b>I</b> come first when it's about AVS.

		I agree to that, but I truly love the community as well, so that's important to me as well. And then some of those stupid crackheads like th3matrix come and attack us, and I'm always just too late to burn him entirely down when the topic is closed.<br />
<br />
I like the preset Sid :)
