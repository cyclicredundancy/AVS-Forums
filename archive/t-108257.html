<div class="posttext">Hey All<br />
This is one of my best avs's, it's smooth, and actually goes to the music unlike some that are just repeating patterns. anyway, check it out and tell me what you think, if you like it and want to see a couple of my other ones, just hit me back at my e-mail. Hope you like, and enjoy<br />
<br />
(oh yeah i'm new at this so go easy on me)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">First off I'd like to welcome you to the wonderful world of AVS. <br />
<br />
I say this to almost every noob that comes here.<br />
<br />
Learn to code. Keep making presets. Don't be put off if you feel I am being insulting or harsh towards your preset, just learn from your mistakes.<br />
<br />
Your preset looks nice-ish but it is unoriginal and far too simple. It isn't particularly fast or smooth, if you want fast and smooth with some unique on-beat responsiveness check out the attached preset.<br />
<br />
There is a lot better work out there too, take a look around the forums and you'll see what I mean. Go and download the Whacko AVS packs and the EL-VIS avs packs, look at the work of some of the people on these forums. I posted a list of really good presets a while ago here:<br />
<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=106378<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've said enough, there are other threads that need my attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm guessing there a code for avs, like html for web sites, i'm just wondering where all you people learned the different commands and what does what, is there somewhere where i can learn the basic commands for movement and such, or is it just alot of people taking apart others codes and changing them a bit to do something else, thanx for your time, and i hope to hear back from you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2002, 01:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The code goes into certain effects, like Render/Superscope, Trans/Dynamic Movement.<br />
<br />
The code is all mathematical expressions rather than computer code. If you add a render superscope you can see what I mean, there are several inbuilt sample scopes which you can select from by clicking the 'Load Example...' button.<br />
<br />
Other good starting points are:<br />
<br />
&quot;x=2*i-1;y=0.5*v;&quot;<br />
&quot;r=2*3.1415926535*i;d=0.5+v*0.2;x=d*cos(r);y=d*sin(r);&quot;<br />
<br />
As for DM and the other ones just try things like:<br />
<br />
Per Point: &quot;x=x+0.01;&quot; without clear every frame (rect coords on)<br />
<br />
Per Frame: &quot;dd=dd+0.01;sdd=sin(dd)&quot;<br />
Per Point: &quot;d=d*sdd;&quot; with clear every frame (rect coords off)<br />
<br />
There are some really good threads around here where people have been taught code before, take a look around. In particular there is a thread in 'AVS Presets' titled 'Sneak Peek at AVS Pack!!!' here:<br />
<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661<br />
<br />
Where Nic01 has been giving some quite good DM tutorials and has started on the superscope.<br />
<br />
The other way to learn is to experiment with existing code from other people or that you have made up yourself. Somethings can be done quite easily using SSC and DM, others are hard so you'll probably end up coming up with your own methods after a while. I'd recommend downloading a lot of my presets and tinkering with them since I make a conscious effort to make my code easy to read (it could just be that I like myself too much).<br />
<br />
Another thing that I'd recommend is learning some co-ordinate geometry, especially more advanced things like radial and parametric co-ordinates, if you are already familiar with cartesian co-ords, as they can be converted quite easily to SSC and the DM uses radial co-ords by default.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of writing some big tutorials on superscope soon, if I do I'll give you a shout.<br />
<br />
FYI: HTML isn't code - it is text formatting. C++ is code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow, that was hella nice explanation<br />
<br />
i thought AVS forum Doctrine #302 was &quot;flame and disrespect newbies&quot;<br />
and #502 was &quot;Bitch and moan about the FAQ (maybe add in expeltives such as fuck, or faggot)&quot;<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nah. We just flame noobs when they make stupid posts and we bitch and moan about the FAQ when someone posts something like &quot;How do I stop it from changing presets every 30 seconds&quot; or &quot;AVS is dogpoo, why does it look like shiznat&quot;.<br />
<br />
We are all nice people. Besides, it makes me feel big and important when I teach people stuff (even when it is the basics of superscope). Thats why I'm going to write tutorials soon. :)</div></div><hr />

i totally was not accusing anybody of anything (outside of a few seperate incidents)<br />

i was just being my sarcastic<br />

&quot;sarcasm is the defence of the weak&quot; -some guy i dont agree with<br />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, Jeriko nailed it. It's a simple preset, but everyone has to start somewhere. At starting points go, it's a farly nice liiking one. :) Keeps it up man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hey, thanx for all the advise, i made up one that doesn't use the usual presets, tell me if i'm going in the right direction, or am standing still..oh and am i suppost to be posting stuff like this in this area or is there a designated forum, i don't want to un nessisarily fill it with questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2002, 21:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Basic manipulation of the superscope eh... not bad. Try and make it do something specific, thats more challenging, rather than using the in built examples try and build something from scratch. The preset is quite nice to look at. I'd recommend you try and make a roto blitter style effect using the Dynamic Movement, then you can customise it more. :)<br />
<br />
Before you start thinking that coding isn't too powerful I've attached an example of the superscope's power unleashed so that you can know what it can do. Yes it is solid 3d geometry (which is what I do). With some practice you will be able to do similar things. (Feel free to rip the code apart)<br />
<br />
If you want to start creating complex geometry for superscopes then start with the basics, try making circles and lines that do different things, then you can put them together into more complex objects or start defining new shapes. Try and figure out things like how to draw a line from one point to another and how to draw a circle arc from one point to another, then move onto things like making a filled square or making a line that spins and moves in 3d... keep trying to make specific things as well as messing about with existing code, that way you will be able to make a preset that you want to make as well as being able to stumble upon something nice or clever looking.<br />
<br />
Don't forget how all of the variables work either or how the co-ordinate system works, those things are important to understand other wise you will leave redundant calculations in code without realising it sometimes.<br />
<br />
There is an AVS troubleshooting forum and an AVS presets forum but I don't think that anyone cares too much about where everything is, if they do then it will be moved for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yup. It's more like a 4D-twisted donut than a bottle. It's just because the most common 3D-projected parametrisation looks like a bottle that people call it that :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th October 2002, 16:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Uhh, actually unconed, that's jheriko's incorrect up fog code. Change it to 'alpha=-z1*.1+.5;', and you'll see it's just a regular, curved 3d object.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th October 2002, 16:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It is meant to be just a regular 3d curved object. It also happens to be the niceset looking immersion of the klein bottle in 3-space.. it is a cylinder twisted and connected end to end. It just happens that it is also the projection of the 4d Klein bottle which is the smae shape except that it doesn't self-intersect. So 4-D twisted donut is pretty much correct. The parameterisation I used is more like a pair of 3D moebius strips, twisted together.<br />
<br />
EDIT: oops, I don't believe I missed out the minus! Mathematicians eh... we are always the ones who forget pluses and minuses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A cylinder connected to itself is a torus :igor: <br />

Unless you mean it's a torus extended into a toroidal cylinder and then connected to itself :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Originally posted by Zevensoft <br />
A cylinder connected to itself is a torus<br />
<br />
It is more like a 4d analogue of the moebius strip. You can not construct a moebius stip in 2d, it is a rectangle twisted and connected end to end in 3d, but you can connect a rectangle end to end by bending it to create a ring like you can bend a cylinder to make a torus. The klein bottle is the same thing except we have a cylinder instead of a rectangle, the only way to make this shape is to construct it in 4-space. It is basically a torus which has been twisted into 4-space like the moebius strip is a ring twisted into 3 space.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the bouncing spring, thats some good(ish) superscope-ing but the preset is ruined by the Fyrewurx, the jumpy movement and roto blitter.<br />
<br />
Fyrewurx are nasty.</div></div><hr />
