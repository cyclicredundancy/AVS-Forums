      <p class="post-content"><strong>Not so bad but not so good either</strong><br />
      I don't like that dm very much cause it creates very radical changes<br />
      to preset, and that's a bad thing :weird: You could fix those colors too</p>

      thanx for the 5 Stars:) i didn't hide my skills in DM, first i wanted to learn more about SS.. a short time ago, inspired by El-vis pack 9, i wanted to learn more about DM, so i tooked a movement by El-vis and chanched it in a DM (as written in Coment) the chanche from horizontal to vertical rotations is an idea that i had in SS to chance Directions. on by, i post a other version that didn't have a rectangular coordinates i want to control more for a softer fading. i will try out any ideas, anytime...<br />
      <br />
      blazer1504:<br />
      for less radical changes, try another kind of music (slower), or slow down the fps (go to fullscreen if you didn't)<br />
      for the colors... i like them like they are... if you want, you could change them in SS or however you want...would like to see the Result, if you do...<br />
      <br />
      thanx</p>
