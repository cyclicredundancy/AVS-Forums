      This is how we all start and I must say, it does visualize the music pretty well.<br />
      <br />
      Just some personal tips, just see what you do with it:<br />
      Try to get used with all parts that AVS has to offer. Stay off the codable stuff until you know what everything does that doesn't need coding for the next, say, 10-15 presets.<br />
      Then try if you can do something yourself with the Movement and when you can do stuff with that, try to make some not-too-advanced superscopes. There are tutorials (Atero's primer, PiR's tutorial, there are more) that may help you around.<br />
      <br />
      Have fun AVS'ing!</p>

      As for the preset: It's OK for a beginner.
