      <p class="post-content">It's very easy. When you submit your component, the software estimates your ability to wait patiently. Based on this, it takes the inverse and recalculates this into queue time.<br />

      The databases are very screwy - they don't always work, and if it may just be taking a bit longer for yours to get reviewed. AVS packs rarely stay unreviewed, once they get into our hands, for more than a day. I don't know what takes so long with it sometimes, but it's beyond my power - that I know. :p</p>
