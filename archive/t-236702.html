<div class="posttext">Look is there a way to post a simple avs done by my wife for review from the forum?  She is new to this and until I showed her avs on winamp was one of those computer hate illiterats.  Granted I still cant spell but I can build PC's and this causes a bit of a space between my wife and I on the computer thing.  So AVS is how we connect over the computer.  <br />
<br />
A little help?:igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Next time, please use the AVS presets subforum (http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=137) to submit the presets. Also the prefered packing method around here is zip, AVS files are generally so small you don't need the &quot;more powerful&quot; compression of some other type. Zip is more popular and therefor prefered standard.<br />
<br />
And we don't laugh at new people here...<br />
<br />
We usually just devour their soul, chew up their carcass and spit the bones to the bottomless pit which already is half full of other people's bones.<br />
<br />
That being said, this is quite typical first preset, includes maybe a bit more experimenting with all the different effects, but still not something you could call good with todays standards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here it is in ZIP format,  sorry about the rar just used to it.  Anyway I'm looking for some possitive incuragment for her.  so any further coments are welcome.  Nothing personal Tuggummi, I'm a big fan of your stuff.  Just trying to get her into this, and she's pretty scidish around computers.:igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh yeah, a new female AVSer! Maybe this is her 1st preset ever so it looks fine in a judgement of new people. I think she can do better than this keep on working, learn some codes, tricks and etc.. Gud luck ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well AVS regulars are a pretty tough crowd and usually the more &amp; longer you do AVS the more they expect from you. We try not to be mean to new people (i think?), but honestly i haven't seen too many positive replies to first posters around here, which is sad of course (hmm, i think i understand wotl a bit better now...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to sound harsh (my comment was suppose to be funny, well part of it atleast), but i don't want to give false feedback either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just don't get it :weird:, why 1st posters always got more negative replies than positive, is it a replier natural habit that likes to reply in negative way or the 1st posters fault because they are posting something ridiculous? :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
.rar is faster, produces smaller files, and took zip's place as the common compression format a while back. get with the times already :P<br />
<br />
.zip is yesterdays news..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Why the hell would one ACE a 2.5kb file (heck, even if there were 100 of them). ACE's nice, but I wouldn't bother with acing anything smaller than 100MB.<br />
<br />
The preset is pretty good for a newbie, trust me on that, I've probably seen more newbie presets than anyone else, but as Tug said, not that good in todays standards. Just lose the Roto Blitter, and hmm.... how to express myself... use a more &quot;solid&quot; colour scheme. This looks a bit too &quot;fuzzy&quot; for its own good at times.</div></div><hr />

When was that? Oh was it that time when they added built-in support for .rar in WinXP? No wait, that was zip. Silly me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, zip comes with windows. There is a difference. Thats like saying IE is more popular than Firefox because more people use it, where as the truth is that less people know of Firefox than IE.<br />
<br />
I will agree more people will have less trouble with .zip tho, although these people, as the must stupid and lowest level of user... I care very little about.<br />
<br />
.rar is used all over the internet as the standard for a large file release. This isn't something i have made up, if you download any number of torrents or use any of the file sharing networks and you will know exactly what i mean. If i had to put it into proportions then I would guesstimate that 98% of compressed releases come as a set of .rar files in one of a couple of sizes, 1.99% come in zip and the rest come in crap no one cares about (ace, 7z, bz2, etc...) (excluding 'uncompressed' disc images... even though technically thats compressed files too)</div></div><hr />

Actually I would prefer self-extracting .exe<br />
<br />
NSIS2 .exes come out smaller than zip rar etc... usually, and they work even if they dont have .zip (windows 98 etc...)<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay you all win, i won't argue anymore, i'll simply just  sneer everytime someone asks for a zip instead of rar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">who knows how Phil Katz's implementation of LZW compresson came to be some sort of &quot;standard&quot;? Maybe he left a clue in his suicide note. <br />
<br />
Personally, I really hate self-extracting .exes; they are a definite security risk. <br />
