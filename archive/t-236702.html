      Look is there a way to post a simple avs done by my wife for review from the forum? She is new to this and until I showed her avs on winamp was one of those computer hate illiterats. Granted I still cant spell but I can build PC's and this causes a bit of a space between my wife and I on the computer thing. So AVS is how we connect over the computer.<br />
      <br />
      A little help?:igor:</p>

Also the prefered packing method around here is zip, AVS files are generally so small you don't need the "more powerful" compression of some other type. Zip is more popular and therefor prefered standard.<br />

      That being said, this is quite typical first preset, includes maybe a bit more experimenting with all the different effects, but still not something you could call good with todays standards.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well AVS regulars are a pretty tough crowd and usually the more &amp; longer you do AVS the more they expect from you. We try not to be mean to new people (i think?), but honestly i haven't seen too many positive replies to first posters around here, which is sad of course (hmm, i think i understand wotl a bit better now...)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to sound harsh (my comment was suppose to be funny, well part of it atleast), but i don't want to give false feedback either.</p>

      The preset is pretty good for a newbie, trust me on that, I've probably seen more newbie presets than anyone else, but as Tug said, not that good in todays standards. Just lose the Roto Blitter, and hmm.... how to express myself... use a more "solid" colour scheme. This looks a bit too "fuzzy" for its own good at times.</p>

      </blockquote>No, zip comes with windows. There is a difference. Thats like saying IE is more popular than Firefox because more people use it, where as the truth is that less people know of Firefox than IE.<br />
      <br />
      I will agree more people will have less trouble with .zip tho, although these people, as the must stupid and lowest level of user... I care very little about.<br />
      <br />
      .rar is used all over the internet as the standard for a large file release. This isn't something i have made up, if you download any number of torrents or use any of the file sharing networks and you will know exactly what i mean. If i had to put it into proportions then I would guesstimate that 98% of compressed releases come as a set of .rar files in one of a couple of sizes, 1.99% come in zip and the rest come in crap no one cares about (ace, 7z, bz2, etc...) (excluding 'uncompressed' disc images... even though technically thats compressed files too)
