      <p class="post-content">The only way I know to uninstall plugins/vis are to manualy remove the coresponding .dll in your plugin directory. The directories are different for Winamp 2.X and Winamp 3, and I can't remember either of them right now. But, some plugins come with self-uninstallers, so it depends on your plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And when it's getting really messy, you just uninstall winamp entirely, delete the folder in case it left some plugins, and then reinstall it with the plugins you want. Don't forget to save your AVS's beforehand in another directory ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay, i've seen some grammatically fucked up posts in my time, but this takes the banana. there's just no excuse for that amount of knobosity in one post. and that's including not being a native english speaker, and i'm the first person to defend esl forumers from the wicked flames of those who light their arses on fire to utilize them as communication devices.<br />
      <br />
      (in hindsight that was a really, really long sentence. please excuse me, i just got off a plane and it's 2:45 am.)<br />
      <br />
      as for your plugins...if there's no uninstall file anywhere then deleting the dll and all associated files will work peachily.</p>
