      <p class="post-content"><strong>Some wont install?</strong><br />
      I'm sorry for the simplicity of this question; I have looked but cant find anything.<br />
      <br />
      I cant get any of EL-vis's or Whackos or several other artists works going... It installs them but they dont appear under the selection menu.<br />
      <br />
      I'd really appreciate it if someone wouldn't mind pointing out my error :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe you're installing them to the wrong winamp directory. When installing it make sure you install it to the right directory for whichever winamp you're using.</p>

      <p class="post-content">and make sure you put them in "wacs/data/avs" directory if you have WA3 or "/plugins/avs" if you have any WA version other than 3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The Valentine Dancer is not AVS. Do not install it in the AVS directory. Or better yet, don't install it, because WildTangent is crap and will put a lot of spyware on your computer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS is a visualization studio designed by Nullsoft. It allows users to easily create their own presets.<br />
      The Valentine Dancer is a plugin for Winamp. It is not an AVS preset. It is it's own visualization plugin that has nothing to do with AVS. WildTangent - the company that makes all of the different dancers - is well known for installing spyware on your computer. This spyware sends information about your computer to WildTangent, which spams your e-mail account with a lot of crap. As far as I know, it doesn't do anything more malicious, but I may be wrong.</p>
