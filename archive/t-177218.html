      <p class="post-content"><strong>Save interactive changes?</strong><br />
      Well this is pretty simple, is there a way to let the user save the changes he makes on a interactive preset? Let's say that if a preset has multiple effects to choose from or different inverted colors, if the viewer changes it is there a way to save the changes too if you save the preset in a normal way? Im not sure, but i think it would require some sort of writecode() function, variable mode or what-ever to actually work.<br />
      <br />
      Just curious, and afraid of getting flames from people who don't realize that the changes on a interactive preset don't "stick" :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">saving this directly to a .avs file could be possible... but it needs an APE. a quite simple one though :)<br />
      it just needs to save some registers in its config</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm wondering where you would really use this option... The only thing I can imagine is highscores for games, but that's simply not what AVS is about.<br />
      <br />
      As far as color-schemes and stuff are concerned, why would you want to save this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">What about if you had sliders that would define how the preset reacts to the music and so on? Wouldn't it be nice if you once set them straight for your music you wouldn't have to do that again? I've already used a simple speed slider on one of my presets, but more complicated stuff would be worth it. It would be nice if you could configure the preset to react perfectly to different kind of music, not everyone listens to techno&amp;trance for example :p (which i listen, fyi. and why my presets suck with rock &amp; others)<br />
      <br />
      But if you really think people won't mind that the changes don't stick, then i guess there is no real point in this feature/ape. Im just not too keen on getting flamed, because of what people assume is only natural.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmmm, a Misc / Config APE/component would be nice<br />
      with sliders in its config screen which set reg variables if you change them...<br />
      This would need a separate dev config screen in which you set various basic settings: slider min/max/start values, which register they belong to, how many sliders to display, slider description</p>

      <p class="post-content">But in my opinion this would only aid the music visualization of presets, for reasons i already posted :igor:<br />
      <br />
      And you can't really stop the people who don't want to make music visualizations anymore, they already have enough tools to make avs games etc. :p This little thing will just be drop in a ocean...</p>

      <p class="post-content">wrong forum... go to the winamp tech support forum.<br />
      this is AVS, not AVI ;)<br />
      if you are referring to the Render / AVI component of AVS, then this is still the wrong place to post...<br />
      1st search the forums for a solution and<br />
      2nd if that didnt help, open a new thread and don't post into a thread that has nothing to do with your problem.</p>
