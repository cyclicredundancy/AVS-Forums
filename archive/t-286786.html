      I've been working on this for a while and although this is more of a PoC(Proof of Concept) it's still pretty cool to look at.<br />
      <br />
      It's an implementation of a <a href="http://flam3.com/flame.pdf" target="_blank">flame</a> renderer with most of the features of Apophysis, It still needs Symmetry, better coloring and a more customizable function selection but it does definitely produce flames. The quality is of course not as nice given that it has only a 1/30th of a second to render each frame rather then 5min to an hour.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways I'm submitting it to see what the rest of the community thinks and if they have any better flames they can come up with to insert.<br />
      <br />
      PS. Bewared you will need a fast machine to run this my AMD X2 3800 runs it at about 33 FPS to increase speed look at the init section in the 2nd SS the comment says it all<br />
      <br />
      PPS. The floating point # handling in AVS causes the coefs to drift to 0 over time resulting in the flame collapsing to a point, I'm working on a solutuion but for the time being just reset the SS every so often.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that's fairly damn cool!<br />
      i remember a while back someone made a julia fractal with a ssc but it didn't have any dynamic-ness to it.<br />
      very impressive. it's a pitty about the quality though but i suppose you cant ask more from avs</p>

      <p class="post-content">i highly doubt it.<br />
      it would be possible at very low-res, but you couldn't get a dm's gridsize high enough for the effect to be apparent.</p>
