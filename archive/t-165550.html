			<strong>Looking for butterfly vis!</strong><br />
		
		

		Hey guys I had Winamp5 before and I had this really cool visualization, I think it was called &quot;something butterfly&quot;. Then I reformatted my computer recently and downloaded winamp5 again, this time that vis isnt on there and I cant find it anywhere. It basically had the shape of a butterflies wings I guess but would change colors and stuff, was usually dark blue or black. Sorry thats not much to go by but Id really like to find this vis again thanks!
