      <p class="post-content"><strong>Musically Responsive Preset</strong><br />
      Hey AVSers,<br />
      I've been toying with AVS on and off for about a year now and this is the first one I feel comfortable sharing with the boards.<br />
      I was dissatisfied with Render/Moving Particle so I made my own using Superscopes. I based the code off of one of Tuggummi's presets, but it is all written by me.<br />
      Once I had finished this superscope it was just a matter of blending everything together to make it look right and "dance" right.<br />
      I like this preset because it is super responsive to the music. Because of this it looks good with slow and fast music and also with music with varying beat.<br />
      Anyways, I'm just looking for feedback. Comments, suggestions, and questions are all welcome.<br />
      Thanks,<br />
      Andy</p>

      <p class="post-content">I found out which Tuggummi preset I used as inspiration for my moving particles. It is "Scope in Spotlight II" from the Winamp 5 Picks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, that's a cool preset! Although kaleidoscope-presets are everything else than new, this one is still nice, i like it!<br />
      <br />
      However there are some tips to improve it:<br />
      <br />
      1) use texer2 for the particles. This way you would save the 'r=0 movement' and the dynamic movement-code. just work the dm-code into the texer2.<br />
      <br />
      2) some effect-lists are unnecessary, (the fast brightness for example can also be placed inside the effectlist above it, which makes that particular list unnecessary), also if you follow step 1, some more effect-lists become no longer necessary.<br />
      <br />
      ok, i guess that will clean up the preset a bit...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the advice. I attached what I came up with using Texer II. Man does my frame rate go way up!<br />
      Thanks a lot!</p>
