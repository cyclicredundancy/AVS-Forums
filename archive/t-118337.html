      <p class="post-content"><strong>Fullscreen: no suitable modes found</strong><br />
      I have used the fullscreen AVS visualization before, without problems. But suddenly, I now cannot mess with the resolution etc, because in the "fullscreen video modes" drop down menu, there are "no suitable modes found". How do I fix this problem, so i can use AVS in the fullscreen mode?<br />
      <br />
      I should mention this problem happened concurrently with the mmsystem002 error. I was able to fix that one, sort of, by going to the output preferences, then to the configuration for the wav output plugin, then changing my device from some wierd series of symbols to my "maestro playback" device. occasionally, i still get a strange window stating "you have used a device ID that is out of range of your system". but it still plays music fine.<br />
      <br />
      anyway, any help to get fullscreen avs up and running?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sounds like something got corrupted on your system. Try reinstalling your video drivers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay...<br />
      Press the button on your keyboard that looks like an upsidown flag pointing to the left. Press the up arrow key until the background of the part that says "Shut down" is blue. Press the enter key.<br />
      Now move your mouse pointer over the little circle next to the part that says "Restart in MS-DOS mode." Press the left button on your mouse. Wait until the machine stops doing things.<br />
      Now type the following (the part in double-quotation marks): "format c:" <b>with</b> the colon but <b>not</b> with the double-quotation marks. Press the enter key.<br />
      <br />
      All your problems will be solved :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, don't ever posts something like that again. People who aren't as experienced as you in computers will blindly execute your precise and friendly instructions and send all their data to the void of data destruction.<br />
      <br />
      Does it give you a sick sort of kick to know that you're better than these 'lusers' because you know how to not format your harddrive accidentally?<br />

      Remind me to advise you to delete vis_avs.dll the next time you ask me a question.</p>

      <p class="post-content">'Twas a joke, Steven, no malicious intent involved. Anyone who's smart enough to even know what 'video drivers' means is smart enough to know that 'format c:' will wipe their hdd clean ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sorry. Can't think of anything else. Maybe another program is messing it up. Maybe it will work in overlay mode. Does it work when setup as the background?</p>
