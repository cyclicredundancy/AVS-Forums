<div class="posttext">grrrr... today avs+winamp have crashed about 1 million times while i was making presets :mad: :mad: :mad: <br />
<br />
Sometimes it crashed when the next song came up, sometimes there seemed to be no reason. (The most wicked crash occured when i opened the menu to save my hard work... :cry: )<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me which actions i have to avoid to keep winamp/avs stable? What is strictly forbidden while programming? (I think, the malfunction comes from making presets, cause i don't have any problems while listening to music/switching between presets).<br />
Hope someone can help.. Without a proper working AVS im a broken man... :hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Does it the most when i move/add inverts.<br />
<br />
So many presets redone about 6 times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">don't use sliders excessively, make sure not to have duplicates of APEs.. that's all i can think of, but even then it will keep on crashing now and then :p<br />
<br />
wondering if it's possible to add autosave (in intervals) through an APE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">tomylobos new ape can help for the code part since it logs it whenwver you type. dunno the link right now though:).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This &quot;code-saving&quot;-ape sounds great. Would be nice if you could find out a link or something. <br />
But an ape that saves the complete preset from time to time seems to be best solution (too bad that i have no idea about making ape's)<br />
At least i'm quite relieved that im not the only one beeing harassed by those inconvenient crashes..</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you put your whole preset in an effect list while you are making it, you can disable the el while you code and make changes and enable it to see the result. It will never crash while the el is disabled cos it wont be recompiling</div></div><hr />

That's for sure! Besides i tried out if avs 2.6x was more stable, but it also crashed from time to time.<br />
<br />
(I was just about to make a long-time experiment with any combination of AVS 2.6x or 2.81 with either Winamp 2.x or 5.05. And give a statistical analysis which possibility results in the fewest crashes, but i no longer feel like it ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Crap. WA/AVS crashed hundreds of times when I was still using w98. Words go that (before wa5.x at least) wa2.78 or 2.79 were the most stable. Can't remember where I picked it up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Winamp 2.81 was the most powerful of those that were stable too. AVS crashed only once in a month!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, Interesting theories, but some of them sound false to me.<br />
<br />
I use WinAmp 5 &amp; Win98SE and they work pretty damn good for me, i rarely get crashes, but those occur sometimes too so im not completly safe. Usually it doesn't matter though since i save often, which is the treatment i recommend for you too :) After a while, it just becomes natural for you.</div></div><hr />

I save the preset every time I enter it or change the code, even it is only a single line :D so I never lose anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">By the way, closing/opening the AVS window saves it too, but to the current preset-file. This way you don't need to go through the entire save/are you sure thing and all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
O.K. i can probably get used to save more often and follow some other advice, but when avs crashes nearly every 15 minutes you simply start to feel pissed off...<br />
<br />
By the way, i cannot remember any crashs when i was using Winamp 2.91 and AVS 2.6 under Win98 (my last PC)! definitive.<br />
And no idea why or what is differnet now?!?</div></div><hr />

Yea thats quite a good tactic too. I sometimes close and open the AVS window to check my preset is OK on init and as a bonus it saves. Its quicker and easier than a file-&gt;save too</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Closing and reopening also brings back order to your preset: you certainly know that avs sometimes doesn't render the effects the way they are listed up (mostly after you rearranged the effects). When you close the window and open it again the effects are displayed in the order they are rendered.</div></div><hr />
