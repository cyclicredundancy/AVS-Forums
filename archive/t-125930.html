      i wanted to make a red dwarf preset but the was no way in hell i was recreating the Red Dwarf ship so i recreated the starbug ship using a load of sphere scopes. Im not sure what i want to do with it though and i dont know how i can make the scopes work more in harmony, i mean like they rotate prefectly with each other, etc etc. Also some suggestions or tips on what to do with it would be nice :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i don't know why i have to keep saying this, but...<br />
      NEVER USE STRAIGHT UP GETOSC FOR STATIC RANDOMS. Use something like: (getspec(0.24,0,0)*10000)%100/1000-0.05<br />
      Basically it needs to move a LOT more, and change colors...it's a really cool effect, but it's ruined by that not-rotating thing. If you really need to keep what's in front in front, then use depth coloring and maximum blend.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero's right about the depth coloring and max blend. Then you can do full 3D rotations and it'll still look decent. Toss in a star field maybe.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your coordinate system is kind of messed up which causes the spheres to rotate incorrectly. You need to switch to a camera-oriented model rather than object, so you can synch different scopes more easily.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Raz, this definitely doesn't look that great. Try doing the spheres a different way to make them look a bit better.</p>
