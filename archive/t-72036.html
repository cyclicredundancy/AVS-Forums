      <p class="post-content"><strong>Awesome AVS Hologram Zipper Twist Remix</strong><br />
      I thought I would post another remix to the Awesome AVS file. I tried working with the cos, atan, and log10 effects to see what I could come up with, and experimenting is working so far!<br />
      <br />
      Tell me what you think of this remix!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, I understand. I also understand that's not what I want in this preset.<br />
      <br />
      I don't want everything going round and round. That's not what this preset is about.<br />
      <br />
      Making a circular movement on a preset and using the mirror completely wipes out the need for the mirror.<br />
      <br />
      A mirror is square, therefore, not a circle.<br />
      <br />
      Do you mean, maybe a dynmov like this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i tried ur "dyn mov" and it justs goes straight what's up with that<br />
      with a dyn mov you have to try it with another preset and check waht it does, understand me,</p>

      <p class="post-content">At least the Dynamic Movement on "Aaaron--Awesome V4" did something. Notice on "AwesomeAVSHologramZipperTwistRemix" that if you delete the Dynamic Shift and Dynamic Movement from the beginning, there's no difference in the appearance of the visualization.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's my procedure of "trial and error".<br />

      <p class="post-content">no, the dyn mov from awesome-v4 is useless,<br />
      (it still doesn't do anything)<br />
      an advice, download the original preset from my remix challenge and put your "dyn mov" from awesome--v4 into it and see if you see any difference</p>
