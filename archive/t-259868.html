      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Performance</strong><br />
      First off, to escape any flaming, I'd like to say that I read the FAQ. I understood the explanations, but there is still things that seem kind of odd.<br />
      <br />
      What I do not get, is what kind of system do you have to have in order to get a decent FPS at a resolution that gives a box bigger than a 4"x4"?<br />
      <br />
      I know that AVS's performance is based on CPU capabilities alone. However, last time I checked, the 4800+ X2 from AMD was pretty adaquate for most CPU intensive applications. Maybe since I got this thing several months ago standards for CPU perf. have completely changed.<br />
      <br />
      I tried almost all combinations of settings and the best resolution I can get for a smooth framerate is like 320xWhatever. This is after I used the tips in the QSG.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      So, what CPUs are you guys using? and what frame-rates are you getting at which resolution? Also, any helpful configuration tips would be much appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      My other question was about the statement in the Wishlist FAQ about multithreading. What exactly does "making AVS more multithreaded" mean? And how multithreaded is it now? Meaning, is it possible to enable SMP for fullscreen applications?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow. Switching to the classic skin tripled my FPS!!!<br />
      <br />
      I guess re-reading the QSG for a second time is worth it.<br />
      <br />
      Either way, I would still like to know what you guys run and what FPS @ what resolution you are able to get; and what the best setting for render thread priority is?<br />
      <br />
      Also, does size of monitor matter? and how do I "rate" the presets to change the frequency of their occurance?</p>

      <br />
      *takes out sledge hammer and destroys a piece of the computer* ahh much better.<br />
      yeah anyway with those stats alone i have to remain in 320x240x16 in fulscreen and 256x256x16 for windowed if i want a decent framerate.<br />
      <br />
      max i've ever hit was prolly 90fps with a one effect and with UnConeDs Zero-G-MazeIII i get at least 15fps fullscreen and windowed. -_-'<br />

        <p class="post-content">Intel historically has stronger FPU's (they usually perform better in Whetstone benchmarks for example) and AVS code is pretty dependant on floating point operations since all user code uses doubles for variables.<br />
        <br />
        It has been my experience generally that Intel processors perform better with AVS than their AMD counterparts.</p>

        <p class="post-content">AMD CPUs generally have inferior hardware to an "equivalent" Intel, and AVS is one of those few applications which is almost totally dependant on the CPU only. There are a couple of things in particular that are very important for AVS performance: the clock speed and the FSB speed.<br />
        <br />
        The clock speed effectively limits the maximum number of equivalent instructions the CPU can call per second. Higher is better for AVS, period.<br />
        <br />
        The FSB speed has an effect on memory access speed and memory copying speed. Since AVS has to copy a reasonably large framebuffer around in RAM, more is better here too.<br />
        <br />
        AMD CPUs don't compare very well to Intel's if we use these two things as our main criteria. Of course AMDs will still outperform Intel when it comes to Microsoft Office or your latest 3D game... but just not for AVS where almost all of the load is on the CPU.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The video memory bus is also important here, but these days it is usually so fast (AGP, PCI-E etc...) that it makes only a token difference for AVS. (As a sidenote even the best PCI-E slot isn't fast enough to maximise performance on graphics cards from 3 or 4 years ago, such as the GeForce 4 MX, and is something which I expect to see improved in the future, especially when given the number of graphics techniques (radiosity) and preexisting games (insert any game with dynamic loading here) that would benefit from a fast copying speed into video memory.)<br />
        <br />
        Hope this helps.</p>
