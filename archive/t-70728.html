<div class="posttext">Here is a preview of my second pack &quot;Closer to Demiurgy.&quot; My first pack &quot;Part Way to Demiurgy&quot; should be out any day now. Damn it takes these reviewers a long time to process stuff. This really gets my panties in a bunch, man!:mad: I have improved so much since I sent out the first pack that I'm not even interested in it anymore!:mad: They really need to do something about this eon long wait. Either way, here are my visualizations. I would be honored to hear what everyone thinks. Remixes are welcome, but only if its cool that I release it with my pack. Of course, I will give credit where credit is due. Enjoy gentlemen. :)<br />

<div class="posttext">WHAT!:mad: It's not a &quot;pack&quot; Montana. It's a &quot;peak&quot;. Maybe you should go brush up on your english. And Aaron is right, if you are so great that you can afford to down other people maybe you should allow me the rare opportunity to learn from such a &quot;master&quot;. So why don't you &quot;Holla at me&quot;:) and give me some real critisism.<br />
<br />
So what does everyone else think???</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Citadel was neat in how you mixed the dyn shift with the roto blitter.<br />
<br />
Ornithopter was not that exciting... I'd suggest smoothing the colors and the 'wings'<br />
<br />
Finally, I was quite amazed with the nebula vis.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you will make more...</div></div><hr />
