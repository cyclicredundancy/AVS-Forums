<div class="posttext">**emerges from hole** <br />
<br />
After a night of tinkering with flash, I've sucessfully created a flash version of the superscope, only without the whole beat thing. It's kinda small, so just zoom in a bunch to see it. After looking more into the possibility of having a more powerful ssc-type thing in flash, I realized that, well, flash really sucks at drawing lines from mathematical formulas. <br />

<div class="posttext">Flash can do some fun stuff visual stuff if you put the time into it.  I made a few things here and there to play around with.<br />
<br />
3D Rhino:<br />
https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ssartell/Rhino.swf?uniq=x47sgx<br />
arrow keys rotate and +/- zoom<br />
<br />
Inverse Kinetics:<br />
https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ssartell/kinematic.swf?uniq=-oriuyt<br />
use your mouse and drag the green dots.<br />
<br />
There's not really any pixel oriented stuff so it's a totally different platform, but it can be fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's a pretty spiffy rhino right there. Unfortunatly, when you rotate it, the fps goes down the drain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">True, true. How, more or less, does one make such a sexy rhino?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can also use home, end, page up, and page down for the rhino to make it solid, transparent, roll right, and roll left, respectively.<br />
<br />
But, OROD, how does yours work?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Insert and delete turn on and off the edge outline too.  At one point I was working on making it render with cell shading but it didn't quite work out, but the outline stayed.  I can adjust the thickness of the outline too but I think I like it best at just 1.<br />
<br />
Yeah the fps go to hell when it your rotate, but it is doing nearly 500 polygons...  When I'm off work maybe I'll put up a version with a different shape with less polygons.<br />
<br />
I wrote the engine to render said rhino over the summer when I started playing with flash.  It's the same deal as doing a 3D ssc in winamp only you do 3 points for each polygon and flash has built in functions to draw shapes in 2D.  There's a little more organization required in storing vertices efficiently so you don't store multiples of the same thing.  I can give you more details than that but I wasn't sure exactly what you're looking for me to say about how it's done.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about making a 3D flash game but a) I don't what kind of game I should do b) the polygon count would be pretty dang low c) the fps could be unstable.  It's still a possibility though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It would be pretty cool to have a shape drawing APE though, with options like the ones in flash.  So then we could do vector graphics :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, I have one on my comp, but its sooooo buggy...<br />
<br />
Its worse than 3D Tentacles when you open it...</div></div><hr />

i think i allready saw a few 3d flash games that were compleatly 3d, used your graphics card n everything. i don't know if they used a 3rd party plugin or what. but i do remeber them.,, one was like a 3d version of sfcave but 20 times faster and a lot of fun!.. but then they started charging money n i was forced to start actually doing work at college instead of lazing around playing flash games on the net...</div></div><hr />
