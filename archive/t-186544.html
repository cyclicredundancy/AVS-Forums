<div class="posttext">APE's <br />
i just want o confirm something<br />
<br />
APE's are rather plugins for AVS rather than direct winamp plugins right?<br />
<br />
does anybody know hwere a list of released APE's is?<br />
<br />
they allow you to interfere with the actual framebuffer and modify it right?<br />
<br />
i am plannign to make a couple of APE's.. one that inports visualations from a third party program (running concurrently) and blends it into the aps visualisation..<br />
and another that does the opposite..<br />
<br />
just wondering where to start.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">APE list (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90097&amp;highlight=APE+list)<br />
<br />
An APE is basically a .dll renamed to .ape<br />
<br />
That's pretty much what APE's are, yes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this is actually covered by the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=82567), but the link to the APE SDK is outdated. not sure if it's included in the Winamp SDK (http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/winamp/sdk/), but Google (http://google.com) or Forum Search (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php) might help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">actually, if you use the sdk files for vc++ it automajikally names it .ape, thus, step3 is done for you. So, there are ONLY TWO STEPS INVOLVED IN MAKING AN UBER-COOL APE!!!!!<br />

<br />
I was thinking you could send the newest versions of any APE's you update to me, then I could put them on the site. I know the problem with outdated APE's, I have the problem of crashes with old versions of Texer and Colour Map and it annoys me going through about 20 pack installers trying to find the latest one.<br />
<br />
/edit Registered avsapes.tk It should be up next Tuesday</div></div><hr />

You want the authors to make the effort of sending updates for your site. Bit of a cheek, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you'd better make that page a link collection:<br />
just link to the author's page or to the download page of the specific ape<br />
if the author changes the download urls and sets value on having his newest apes on that site, he/she sends a mail to you and you change it...<br />
that's minimal effort for both :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The thing is, I plan to make this a site for beginners, where they can just download all the APE's they want without having to trawl through a load of different download pages and forum topics. Anyway, the site was just gonna be a basic 5-column table, with the name of the APE, with a download link, name of the creator, with a link to his page, version number, file size and a link to a sperate description of the APE (either written by the author or me) and a couple of screenshots. So, as UnConed is a mod here, I'm asking him if I could post the APE's on the page, if I keep them as up to date as I possibly can by myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm sorry I really really love the FAQ and if you can't be arsed to use a FAQ on a forum then you should be shot. There exists a list, it is a bit rubbish like you say, so what I think (know) might (will) be a great idea is to stick a link to this site on the end of the APE faq entry.<br />

<br />
Why not use a direct link to acko.net (only example i can think of) or whatever site the ape is hosted on by the author... then you won't have to update them yourself.. you save webspace and you won't have to struggle to try to find an actual reason to do it in that awkward way. It won't mean that users will have to trawl through a million download pages etc....<br />
<br />
btw multi filter will never be updated (much to my annoyance) due to lack of a source code for it, since I wiped my comp since then (not by choice). So I don't mind if you stick that one up on your site.</div></div><hr />
