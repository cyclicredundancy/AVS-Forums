<div class="posttext">Does anybody have a plugin or know of a way to make AVS switch presets. I'm trying to make it automatically switch every 20-30 seconds. I'm starting to use winamp to DJ and I would like to use avs on a seperate screen without having to worry about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">LilCalvin: you can either use the internal random mode of avs (left click on the avs-window to change settings) or use a more advanced software like hotlist (http://www.hotlist.psytrancecamp.de/).<br />

hungryskull: always in to maintain this forum's reputation as the world's most unfriendly forum, eh? i havn't seen a single constructive post from you yet. just because others spread a bad attitude, you don't have to apply this. fyi: old  posts in this forum seem to get purged, searching doesn't always bring up an answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hungryskull, while you were throwing that sarcastic comment, you could've also just answer the damn question so this could be put behind us :hang:<br />
<br />
Just open AVS, open the editor (if you have default settings then you must right click on top of the window and choose &quot;AVS Editor&quot; instead of double clicking it)<br />
Then go to settings -&gt; Presets/Hotkeys and you will find the checkboxes you are looking for there :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this should be in the faq, as it is (as hungryskull correctly, but unfriendly, remarked :)) a question asked quite frequently</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">oops :D i must've overread that...<br />
LilCalvin read the AVS FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567) and search the forums (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php) before posting next time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No actually, I'm not here to cause more problems.  I think certain others have that area covered.  As for your second comment, I have a feeling that I have had constructive posts, and just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they don't exist.<br />
<br />
If some of the stuff I post comes off sounding offensive, most of it probably isn't intended.  <br />
<br />
Now let's let this thread die.<br />
<br />
BTW would it be possible to stop this forum from being pruned?</div></div><hr />

Actually, its the opposite question that has been answered about 5 million times 'How do i stop avs from randomly changing presets?'. Get your facts straight before you diss someone.. or someone else will smack you down for it.<br />

Now that is a stupid question. Think about it... its common sense really.<br />
<br />
For the record I too have yet to see a constructive post by hungryskull. Unless by constructive you mean 'adds to post count'.</div></div><hr />
