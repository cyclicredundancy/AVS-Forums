      <p class="post-content"><strong>Starting AVS In Fullscreen?</strong><br />
      Im using AVS presets as part of a visualisation system in another program, its running on a via C3 800mhz, hence its very slow -is there a way to get avs to automatically load in fullscreen or overlay mode ( preferable the overlay mode ( a fake fullscreen )) as it runs much faster in this mode. - thanks<br />

      <p class="post-content">starting avs in overlay mode is possible (just enable overlay), for fullscreen you always have to do that manually</p>

      <p class="post-content">a <b>lot</b> of improvements have been done in the last few weeks, we cannot expect more of Justin. And for pixel doubling: You better have a small window which looks sharp, instead of a large screen which looks very pixelated. (imo). (of course a large window with high quality is best, though most computers won't pull that off). I'm running 400x300 without pixel doubling.</p>

      <p class="post-content">my 3.2ghz p4 will do 1280x1024 without doubling<br />
      <br />
      I understand why avs needs lots of cpu - just would like more options of setting how its displayed and its startup mode to get the most out of it...<br />

      <p class="post-content">i will take a look tonight they're included in 5 i think? - not amazing at that res - certainly watchable at 15fps +<br />
      to get silky smooth i'm at 800x600 realistically</p>

      <p class="post-content">rofl - you didn't have enough cooling - my CPU overclocking runs at 25 degrees, my case runs at 30<br />

      Even if a fan was to die the motherboard would turn system off upon CPU reaching 60 degrees</p>

      <p class="post-content">I had plenty of cooling, I just had a few cases all hooked together with parts lying all over my basment desk with one of those big box fans blowing over the whole desk :D. The processor may have sucked but I had a nice hardrive setup, I had something like 30gb worth of hardrives lying around that I just switched around and plugged in when I needed them. Oh yeah, did I mention I had the whole thing set up with neon lights and other little flashy lights, it looked pretty cool when it was just sitting there glowing in the dark.</p>
