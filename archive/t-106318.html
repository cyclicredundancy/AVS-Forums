(main improvement it autodetects wa2/3 directory)

Damn, your programs reminded me of how much I need to look for my Visual C++ 6.0 CD. The only language I have installed on my system at the moment is Visual Basic. :(

		yeh but i actually have a legal copy with the huge msdn library and it will take me more than 12 hours to download a whole gigabyte of data.<br />
<br />
i also have a legal copy of .net lying around somewhere but vb.net is dog shit and vc.net is slow.

		Okay 12 hours was an exaggeration (more like 2-3, but that is still ages) but I'm not gonna download warez versions of things that I already own. I also don't want c++ without the help files, thats how I learn new things and the msdn cd's that came with c++ have so much on them and its faster to use off of the hard disk than to use the msdn website.

		pssh! obeying the law!<br />
<br />
(i found a Serials2K update website today, im happy! I will use it for...umm...backups of my software. Yeah, thats it, archival purposes)<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, i did not realize Winamp2 had a generate HTML playlist function, i thought that was pretty sweet (wonder why WA3 doesn't?)( I really like the way they stack the text in their &quot;logo&quot;, that was really clever, but then again, so is nullsoft)<br />
<br />
So i did the obivious, but formatted it to fit my website a little better.<br />
<br />
(I always did want people to look at my music, I consider my self pretty well rounded, maybe a little heavy on the hip-hop)<br />
<br />
