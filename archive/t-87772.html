			<strong>How much time do you spend in the forum?</strong><br />
		
		

		I've always wondered how much time people spent in the main AVS forum and its subforums.  <br />
<br />
Also, what time of day are you usually in the AVS forum? (and the time zone; because that makes a little difference too :)).<br />
<br />
How frequently do you check in on the AVS forum?<br />
(what I had in mind is especially for people who may check the forums frequently, but don't stay in for very long at a time)<br />

		I generally check in the morning, and before I go to bed (times vary, depenting on the day). More often if I ask a question, less often if I feel like it. :)

		I generally check the forum twice a day, or more depending of the day...My time is GMT+1 (Paris) and I generally check at about 1:00PM and 11:00PM ....
