			<strong>Preset request, for Elise</strong><br />
		
		

		Elise Katherine &quot;toqer&quot; Cortese was born last night at 2:33am.  I'm hoping someone can make me a cool preset in her honor.  This is kind of what I pictured.<br />
<br />
An outline of a 3rd trimester fetus drawn as a superscope. There's a heart that glows on beat, and the fetus slowly and randomly rotates.<br />
<br />
Surrounding the fetus outline is a simple superscope circle, sort of representing the womb.  It does that wavy wavy beat detection avs does so well.<br />
<br />
And that's it.

		That's a proud father who wants to celebrate the birth of his daughter in a somewhat unconventional way.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, by the way.<br />
<br />
Anyway, such a preset would definitely be possible, but it would be a rather tall order. I've got some ideas of how I could do something like this, but I would need someone else to create the appropriate 3d model.<br />
<br />
(If you think that's disturbing, by the way, imagine what he had to do to -become- a proud father... And thank goodness he didn't ask for an AVS preset of that!)

		Heh thanks stevenroy.<br />
<br />
I wasn't even thinking of a complex 3d model, just a simple line outline of a fetus.  Heck, could even be a bitmap for all I care.<br />
<br />
But a 3d model brings some interesting ideas.  Like, a psuedo ultrasound avs that shows the baby coming in and out of the dark like in an ultrasound picture.
