<div class="posttext">I have failed to find an all inclusive help section that discribes each setting's option in detail.  In fact what's annoying is that even the FAQ says:<br />
<br />
&quot;Question #2: How can I configure AVS?<br />
<br />
...From the menu's available, you can access all the options that AVS provides. These are mostly self-explanatory, but the difficult ones are covered in specific questions. <br />
<br />
Self explanatory?  For a newbie such as myself I disagree.  I have failed to find out what &quot;Reuse image on window resize&quot; does or &quot;wait for retrace&quot; does or &quot;page flipping&quot;.  Granted I have not searched for an answer for each indivual setting but I feel I shouldn't have to.  <br />
<br />
MilkDrop is very user friendly, why can't AVS be?  Please someone, make an all inclusive help section or web page discribing all of the features available in AVS.  THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
PS.  If there is one all ready, I obviously didn't find it.  Please shoot me a URL if there is one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They don't give too major of a result except for Wait for Retrace - It pretty much slows down AVS, which you don't need for most cases...<br />
<br />
As for user-friendliness, pir and Atero are writing tutorials and guides. There's also a tutorial thread in the main AVS forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">People don't have an obligation to write excessive tutorials and documentation for free software. The FAQ is unofficial and it doesn't pretend to answer every question that will ever pop-up here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait for retrace&quot; is the opposite of Milkdrop's &quot;Allow page tearing&quot;.<br />
&quot;Page flipping&quot; determines the mechanism of updating the image, either by using a back/frontbuffer pair (with page flipping), or just one frontbuffer (no page flipping).<br />
&quot;Reuse image on window resize&quot;: pretty darn obvious, but this doesn't make the image go blank when you resize or go fullscreen.</div></div><hr />
