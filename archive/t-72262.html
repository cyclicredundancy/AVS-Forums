      I want to know what you think.<br />
      <br />
      Here lately, as you know, I've been "accumulating" more custom presets.<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to know whether you guys think I should go ahead and send a pack to WinAmp, with just about 10 in it, or continue and make more presets, until I get to a bigger number, of 20.<br />
      <br />
      Remember, this is my first set ever, so I dont know what the "Usual" is for a newbie when it comes to WinAmp publishing.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone care to give a good round number?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>You should</strong><br />
      I think you should publish the presets. They may even be published earlier.</p>

      It is saying my image files aren't .jpeg or .gif files, when they darn well are.<br />

      Oh well, maybe later.</p>
