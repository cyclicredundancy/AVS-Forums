			<strong>[ASK] How long time it took for the staffs to review visualizations?</strong><br />
		
		

		I submitted my visualization about 1 week ago. I am waiting till now for the approval or rejection, But till now, no actions performed to my visualization...<br />
What's wrong with it? Are there thousands of other visualization pending for approval too? :confused:<br />
Thanks

		it depends all on when the visualisation reviewers look at things and it typically takes a few weeks from what i've seen for visualisation packs but you may be lucky (or not as reviewers do it when they have the freetime/remember to do it).<br />
