      <p class="post-content"><strong>Phase diagram, part II</strong><br />
      Alright. this is what i'm trying to do. I put this "x=getosc(i,0,1);y=-getosc(i,0,2)" into the Per Point field. Left channel on X axis, Right channel on Y axis. Not good enough. What i want to do, is almost the same thing, only left and right are each 45 degrees to the X axis, 90 degrees from each other, with 'in phase' information on the X axis, and 'out of phase' information on the Y axis. If anybody here listens to vinyl, they'll know what i'm talking about.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok from what I'm reading, that doesn't make any sense at all. Right and left are 45 degrees from each other?? Right and left channels? What's right and left because the channels are just signals not something you can rotate.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think I get what he is trying to say. I think he wants something like to clusters of dots coming out of the center of the SSC, each representing one channel. And in the center there would be a cluster representing the things the two channels have in common. I could be very wrong, that post was kinda cryptic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sounds like you need:<br />
      <br />
      l=getosc(i,0,1);r=getosc(i,0,2);<br />
      x=(l+r)*.707;<br />
      y=(l-r)*.707;<br />
      <br />
      Easy as pie.</p>
