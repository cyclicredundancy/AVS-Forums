      <p class="post-content"><strong>Adding a Picture to a song</strong><br />
      Is it possible to always see a picture when I play a certain song ? I got a bunch of songs and I wanna see the picture of the chords every time I play a song. So associate a picture with a song ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">If you are into lotsa fuzzy work [and you have not so many songs to work with] you could probably do something like make AVS recognise the song lenght. And for additional certainty make it check the start volume or after the first 10 secs or sth like that.<br />

      But you'd have to type all the lenghts and other identification stuff by hand!<br />

      Why not, if you could do that every time that the time (lets say in time display changes) so should the AVS. So there should be some connection with AVS and the length of song.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know how it works, but I am guesing that the time display gets some signal that the time needs to be changed, and puts the time of next song?

        <p class="post-content">Here is why you fail:<br />
        <br />
        The length of the song is not unique.<br />
        <br />
        There is no way to store a list of song lengths and associated pictures without limiting yourself to a small number of pictures and songs.<br />
        <br />
        By your own words you "don't know how it works", in that case, you also don't know how to work out whether something is possible or not. Guessing doesnt help.</p>

        <p class="post-content">You just can't say I want this song at this x position, it's impossible unless you use a sort of "ID3" guessing tag operation ... or play the song before hand recorded as a quick few numbers (considerably because its always outputted as a graph) ...and use those to compare to the song.</p>

        <p class="post-content">guys.. let me rephrase my "it can't be done."<br />
        <br />
        What I meant was: Yea sure it can be done if you'd want to go all &#195;&#188;bergeek h4x0r about it, but most likely jmwatte is new to the scene and possibly has never even opened the editor, since he's referring to presets as pictures..<br />
        <br />
        He's asking where to find a (nonexistant) checkbox, not something that almost goes over our heads as well.<br />
        <br />
        I guessed that was pretty obvious.<br />
        But well, I should've known you guys to go techy before answering the original question <u>for the person who asked the question</u></p>
