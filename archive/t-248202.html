			<strong>Tips&amp;Tricks in AVS 2</strong><br />
		
		

		Hello and welcome to the new Installment of Tips&amp;Tricks<br />
<br />
The original is so old now i guess no one has anytime to post on it. and awhile ago on the post someone said the post needs to be refreshed. so I will start the post anew.<br />
<br />
There is a new point tho. if you have color gradient,solid scopes,aspect ration fixes, and color mod questions please look up the answer in Tips&amp;Tricks 1. that way the post will be clean for the newbies to find the right code examples and stuff.<br />
<br />
the rules except for the ones stated above remain the same as in the old one.<br />
<br />
Chow and enjoy!!

		It needs a refreshment indeed, but IMO mainly because it is in the form of one giant forum thread now, and thus difficult to seach in. Most of the old tips are still relevant.<br />
<br />
Starting a second thread (not post!) doesn't solve this, it'd only make things more difficult.<br />
<br />
My best solution would be to put everything in the tips and tricks thread in a webpage with a link to every tip/trick in an index.<br />
<br />
But be aware of the fact that the copypasing alone will take you months. Enjoy it ;).

		When i first posted the thread i was a enthusiastic and wayyy too excited n00b who thought that he could change the world with this! Now that im a bit older n00b i realize that while it is a novel idea, in practice the Tricks &amp; Tips fails horribly. Most of this is because it has no control whatsoever and there is no way to remove obsolete, old or just way too simple stuff in today's standards.<br />
Also what qualifies as a tip or a trick? How simple to go with the tip or how advanced? Is it a tip about coding? Is it a ready-to-use string of code that is useful in general? Who shot the monkey? And why the hell im still writing this?<br />
<br />
In short: Novel idea, in practice fails horribly without any sort of control or organizing.

		Suggestion: Three Tips and tricks sections. One, for the n00bs, can be placed in the welcome section. There can also be an advanced and intermediate grade, which should get their own threads, as soon as we manage to consolidate the old tips and tricks thread.

		But who decides who is a n00b, who is intermediate, and who is advanced? You know damn well no one will admit to being a n00b and will spend time in the intermediate section. Anyone who would use the advanced section, won't really need to. Therefor, it won't work.

			<strong>I agree</strong><br />
		
		

		I agree with pak-9s reply to denkensiefursich's post.<br />
but i have a better idea since i use the internet rarely i copied the text forms of the sticky and you know what i'll take my sweet time i have to go throu it and take the worth while descriptive codes and dump the useless chitchat and post it on the visualnoobs website that way the sticky can be deleted and this one can be stickyed and as the posts go i'll record the codes and ideas submitted. how does that sound. :D

		i have all the attachments now and i have the text forms of the sticky. you can now erase tips and tricks in avs. without losing anything special. question tho i think it would get kinda messy any ideas how to make a simple help file thing that will show the documents and have connections to the parts of them by subject?
