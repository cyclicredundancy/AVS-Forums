<div class="posttext">i takes about 48 hours to get a skin submitted. my last update only took 24 hours. yes, i'm talking about the winamp site. not bad, eh? not bad! at least better than the 3-6 months to get a plugin online. plus you get a real rating!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well my xenon is waiting over two months (and it means maybe i have to wait 4 more?)<br />
once upon a time grandchild said that he would do the job and i thought that he really has done his job since normal staff feedbacks has been appeared. but if he finished i would apply for it if possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the problem is there's no one doing avs presets afaik and i doubt people would want them just pushed through with a default rating/comment unless that is the case then i'll happily do that (as i'm only ment to be doing full plugins and there's always been more people doing skin reviews anyway seeing as that's what mainly gets submitted).<br />
<br />
Yathosho: it'd be criminal to keep an update of fossil held back for so long (am liking the tweaks to the vis that was done btw).<br />

<div class="posttext">I'm interrested too, that way we can split the amount of work. Having two people also prevents longer delays if someone doesn't review for a while for some reason.<br />
<br />
I have to see what the job contains exactly, though.<br />
<br />
I'll PM him</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">is something happened?<br />
anyway somebody would push that approve button on my xen-on because i submitted it about 3 and a half months ago. there is really nobody to do this stuff? i thought it seriously when i said i would do it. i think Dr0 and wotl thought it seriously too and we're not shouting random words accidentally just because it's fun. also i hate when people say that avs is dead i know there are just a phew people making presets but they're still making presets and there are much more people just watching it. i think this isn't the definition of a &quot;dead&quot; art.<br />
sorry for the speech but i hate stagnation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Micro.D, do you have access to the reviewers backstage forum? You should have.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident that the admins don't visit this subforum, and especially not a thread titled 'wow'</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The list of packs that have been submitted to winamp.com (I'm a reviewer now, together with micro.D) <br />
You said 'it is awkward for you'.. I thought you mean the time it takes before your pack is published there.</div></div><hr />
