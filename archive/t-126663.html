<div class="posttext">not done too much last few days. I did this before though. I wanted to create a sort of electricity orb in space type thing, ive done it and now i dont know what the hell else to do to it, any suggestions very welcome as always :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't like the heavy blur, i prefer medium blur to smooth up the scopes. Also the background is too static and those blurs really slow it down. Maybe you could just use one dynamove with alpha blending to create a nice flowing background.<br />
<br />
Nice idea, but you need to work on the aesthethic side of it a bit more :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its nice...Dont like its looks too much,the blur is too heavy like Tuggummi said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Make the Objects turn around the weirdly, onbeat. In all 3 Directions.<br />
But the difficulty is to keep them in one Axis. You'll need a fixed Mode Var to do this. Not easy though, but should look extremely good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would hafta agree with Magic.X  it would look totally awesome if you got some more rotation going on :) nice work overall though. The random whisps of color coming in the background are awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Or...You can add 2 circles that do a rotation around the cubes or something like that :) Like a chimical element...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, you should definitely get the thing rotating a bit more freely.  keeping the rotation so that the thing's forward shouldn't be do hard (especially for you, you seem to have a handle on that sort of thing).  also, if you could make those cubes around the balls look more translucent than wireframe it'd be great.  making the electricity 3D would also help - something like:<br />
x=cos((i-0.5)*2*pi)*v*(rand(100)/50-1);<br />
y=cos...<br />
might work well (haven't tested it)<br />
the balls should also change hue a bit...the psuedo-hsl-conversion, for those who don't know, is:<br />
red=abs(sin(hue))*sat+0.5+lum/2;<br />
green=abs(sin(hue+pi/3))*sat+0.5+lum/2;<br />
blue=abs(sin(hue-pi/3))*sat+0.5+lum/2;<br />
it's not a real conversion, but it works (somewhat).  i've yet to find and implement the correct conversion in avs :/</div></div><hr />
