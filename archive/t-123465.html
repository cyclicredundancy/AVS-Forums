      <p class="post-content">Not a bad noob preset, cant really rate the scope because you didnt make it to begin with, unless theres some big coincidence but anyway atleast youve had a play with it.<br />
      <br />
      I did a little tinkering of my own, changed it quite a bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty decent for a n00b preset, however I do not condone the use of example code anywhere :)<br />
      btw never change pi to anything indivisible by pi if it's already working correctly, or else...well, bad things happen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright noob preset, elko. Try figuring out SSC and DM coding. This could help you make great presets. It looks like you might be able to make decent presets with some math knowledge. Keep it up.<br />
      Raz, I wouldn't really call yours a remix, it has very, very little the same as the original. It's still nice, though, but also kinda noobish, but SSC's are coded,etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i wouldnt call it a remix either, didnt say it was a remix, i called it "tinkering", not really worth the attention or the post really</p>
