			<strong>Nice Presets</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I like your three presets. The first reminds me of destorted TV; the second like a fractal; and the third like a psycodelic un, not sure, but it was cool  :cool:. Try making the presets be lighter and have more definite colors. Also every one of your presets used the colorfade creating a kind of noise which detracts from the preset. Try to advoid using the onbeat random inside a feedback loop. The file below is a cool color fad effect that is much softer on the eyes:

		your color wheel looked nice but it's not the look i was aiming for previously.<br />
I like the &quot;staticky&quot; looking colors the on beat random gives the colorfade. <br />
Here's my mix of your color wheel, the color is more definate than my previous avs, but still has that grainy look that i like. What do you think?

		Nice. It looks kind of like a galaxy / nebula. Don't let my comment cramp your style; I love abstact grainy preset like yours above. Develop your style and I'm sure your presets will be awesome. I still think it's a little to dark on the outsides. I don't like this because I'd like to see what is going on, but I can't. <br />
<br />
The reason I don't like the on beat randomization on the color fade is because 1 out of 10 times, it makes a bad color mixture not so much that it makes static. (Unless you like all the colors produced from a random color fade) A possibility mapping your on beat color fades to a color map. I also liked your use of the convolution on your first preset. I normally can't get it to look good in my presets, but you made it really work.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your preset :)
