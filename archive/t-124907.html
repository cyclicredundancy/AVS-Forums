<br />
<div class="posttext">It has been booring here lately, so I post one preset on what im working...<br />
The colour effect is nice and if to work bit more on this preset, it might come up pretty cool (i think so), but right now its half done...<br />
Suggestions? Ideas? All are welcome...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice SSC's, but it needs something to go with it.  Throw a nice background DM on it and make the SSC a bit more music reactive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 13:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, what anubis said, plus i dont like the colours. I just dont like bright blue and lime green, it looks awful IMO, very nice scopes though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 13:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Deam.... and thought that colours are nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 14:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, here's the new version...<br />
Sorry Raz, i didnt change colours...<br />
:hang: im having some troubles with background DM :hang:<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, I got some nice ssc-s and some normal presets but i cant make preset what has good ssc AND it looks cool also... :weird:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Its not that hard to make stuff look good, it looks pretty good it just needs work is all, i still dont like the colours very much :p but this looks pretty sweet, i (finally) got around to making a cube, this is what i did with it, i think it looks pretty good. btw i know the shadow is crappy and not correct, well probably anyway ll i did was shift the scope by 0.2 points, meh, stll looks good</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">just did this thingy in about a minute, looks preeety damn sweet IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 18:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice and simple cube (better than mine)... I like the shadow effect and those 3 cubes inside eachother is neat...<br />
This 3d rotation part is bit spooky for me:<br />
:eek:<br />
...<br />
x2=(x1*zzz+y1*zaz)*yyy+z1*yay;<br />
y2=(x1*zaz-y1*zzz)*xax+((x1*zzz+y1*zaz)*yay-z1*yyy)*xxx;<br />
z2=(x1*zaz-y1*zzz)*xxx-((x1*zzz+y1*zaz)*xax)*zzz;<br />
...<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
Okay...? Is this :down: there &quot;good&quot; now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 18:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">now that looks nice, very very nice. It looks all electricy and good now, the colours fit well with it now, and after all my whinging ;) i would make it so the box thingys go until the vanishing point when straight on and off the screen when not and have the oscilliscopey thingy all the way through it, very nice job :up: my cube code probably needs optimising, still, its a cube. Plus my codes nice and easy to read like that for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 19:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank u :), finaly something nice (maybe add some boxes)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 19:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">raz: try making the scopes themselves music responsive, or slightly less &quot;coordinated&quot; - make them twist apart, then back together again every beat or something (like from el-vis's Plasma or Neuromancer intros)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 20:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok made some slight modifications, i hope this is more to your liking atero :p it morphs around, it still needs to morph differently blah blah, ill work on innovation when coursework isnt coming out of my ass.<br />
<br />
edit: ahh bollocks, it morphed around when i made the modifications, piecoshit aint doin it now :mad: crappy thing<br />
<br />
edit2: removed attatchment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 20:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">sorry for all the posts. the morphing just needed a little speeding up is all, btw i tried morphing it on all three but it looked shit and never went back to the cube shapes so i just used it on z, i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 20:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's nice raz. The morphing is kinda weird, but it's nice. Love the shadow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Limpet</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 21:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">They all look prety good, but they are running at about 6-7 fps. Personally i don't like slow presets.<br />
They're still nice though, even when they are double pixeled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 21:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sweet momma :) It looks great but it really needs a background.And modifying the distance could make it look better IMO.Oh and that shadow effect is cool.And and and blah...Its a good preset :)<br />
<br />
PS.  z1=if(equal(a,1),0.2,z1);<br />
     y1=if(equal(a,2),0.2,y1);<br />
     x1=if(equal(a,3),-0.2,x1); and the others -&gt; those equations create the cube right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 21:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 21:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Heh! Now I added 2 more poxes, its lot cooler but slower too.<br />
But how the hell can i optimize it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 21:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah im gonna work on the morphing when i get the time, right now all it is is a bit of z2 multiplied by one of the getosc thingys i used for the rotation.<br />
<br />
As for the FPS its running exceptionally high for my computer, most of my presets run at about 11/12 on my computer and this is running at about 27/28, i dont know, maybe change of music or something.<br />
<br />
and distance, yeah blah blah ill work on it when i get time. busy busy lazy busy b me at the moment. 3 months before GCSEs and im behind on coursework and and and, you get the idea :igor:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Limpet</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th February 2003, 22:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, i take back my last post. when i started avs back up it was running about 25 fps on cube5.5. But the other ones still are slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 00:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">oops, sorry raz, i thought you were the one that posted that.  it's just that you post so damn much is all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 08:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">cube 5.5 runs with 40fps @ 320x200 on my machine. Long live Duron and Geforce 2 ;) I agree with Limpet the others are a bit slow even for my dream machine lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 08:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You could probably reduce the number of ifs in there which should speed it up.<br />
<br />
You rotation looks a tad wonky to me, and you'd get less distortion as the points move farther from the viewing plane if you multiplied by the inverse of z.<br />
<br />
Here's my first box preset if it helps at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 11:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah i thought the rotation looked a bit dodgy at first but with the distortion i didnt notice it. I prefer using all the ifs to using the bor function. i didnt like that method, i thought the if one was much easier. <br />
<br />
As for the posting, yeah i do but... erm... yeah :rolleyes:<br />
Morphing needs work i think ill do that now actaully<br />
Oh yeah phaze graphics cards dont affect FPS, its all processor based.<br />
Pretty nice box JC, I thought id missed a multipication somewhere but i wasnt sure where, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 14:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">heres a new version of my... preset. What do u think of it?<br />
<br />
I added 2 ssc-s and removed some blurs and other trans stuff, also I optized scopes, now its fast and only few not-so-important effects are gone!<br />
- make them twist apart, then back together again every beat or something (like from el-vis's Plasma or Neuromancer intros) <br />
i tryed but i faled... :hang:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 14:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Raz so you say that if i have an amd athlon xp 2200+ and a video card with 16mb ram the presets will run fast ? I have  a p4 1.7 at school with riva tnt2 m64 and they move like crap even at low resolutions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 15:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah and i bet the schools is spread over a network of many many computers isnt it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 15:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">wow, that looks awesome, of course i had to do a remix ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 19:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:up: <br />
Nice background effect and its fast too but i dont like that the superscope looks so insignificant (i guess that this was misspelled) now.<br />
:up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th February 2003, 20:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The movement seems very repetitive.  Try something a little more random.  The background also makes it harder to see the actual SSC as it takes away all of the focus on the SSC.  It's a nice effect, but more of a preset of it's own than a background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th February 2003, 15:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok here's another one, colors are eaven more cooler.<br />
I could make the rings move around the oscilliscopeS but it would only make the preset eaven MORE slower...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th February 2003, 22:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice, but try translating the SSC some so the center of it isn't always in the center of the screen, but don't make it stray too far from the center.</div></div><hr />
