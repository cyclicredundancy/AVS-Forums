Using heytud's preset of Bouncing Superscope, I have created another Kaleidoscope like effect, but this one is sooo awesome!<br />
<br />
You HAVE to check this out!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cool scopes, GREAT colours, just make it more reactive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I really like it. It's very beautiful, but I agree with Dog about it needing to be more beat responsive. At least for the type of music I watch visuals to. I bet it would look really good to ambient music.<br />
<br />
As for making it beat responsive, maybe use a custom movement effect that randomly changes with the beat. I think a while ago people were posting up the mathmatics of the generic movement effects. Just take the code for the 5-point distro and insert it into a DynaMove, hook a randomly generated variable up to 'r' or 'd' and you got it working. Just my two cents. :)<br />
<br />
On a side note, I am very impressed with your progress Aaron. From now to when you started making presets, you have come leagues. Keep moving forward because every new preset you do just impresses us all more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanx guys!<br />
<br />
Well, right now, my college classes just re-started, so I'm gonna be fairly limited to what I can produce in AVS, but, I have no idea on how to code variables.<br />
<br />
If someone wanted to give me a dynamic movement they know would work with the preset well, just put it up here on the list, or email it to me.  I'd be happy to see what I can do.<br />
<br />
Even after reading an email with help on variables, it is still all confusing to me.  I keep thinking I'm gonna have to write this big huge expression, and I know it won't turn out exactly how I want it to because there are so many components.<br />
<br />
Thanx for the encouragement, and keep up the good work all you AVS ppl!<br />
