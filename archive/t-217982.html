      Here's the preset. If you can, look at it for a second and tell me what do you think about it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty nice! The only thing I might change would be the getspec() value, to make it a bit more wavy. But, then that's just a matter of choice, I suppose. Either way, I like it! :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, really nice basic preset! i'd also change the getspec() somehow (imo the amplitude could be a bit bigger). Anyway, that's just a matter of taste.<br />
      Now you should go one and work on the background and i promise it'll be a great preset!</p>

      <p class="post-content">your code is a bit unoptimised<br />
      you use a lot of divisions. better replace them with multiplications whereever possible<br />
      <br />
      bad:<br />
      a=b/c/d;<br />
      e=f/c/d;<br />
      <br />
      so-so:<br />
      a=b/(c*d);<br />
      e=f/(c*d);<br />
      <br />
      good:<br />
      tmp=1/(c*d);<br />
      a=b*tmp;<br />
      e=f*tmp;<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      also, you can cache the values for aspect ratio in frame, since the resolution will surely not change between 2 points ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">TomyLobo, I'll optimize the code as much as I can. I know I left it kinda messy.<br />
      <br />
      ^..^, that's the hardest part for me, the background, because I have neither the experience nor the immagination to create a nice one. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Giving a decent background to any spectrum based preset is a very hard task to do usually, but with a good enough idea for the spectrum and a good execution (like yours) you might get away with no or a very minimal background :)<br />
      <br />
      And a nice spectrum it is, personally i would make the the reactions a bit "sharper" as in adjust the width of the getspec() from 0.04 to 0.01 for example. Also a bit more strength could do some good as with more quiet songs it doesn't do much, just spins around.</p>
