TITS????<br />
What's wrong with tits? :p<br />
This is just a little in-joke, though i might be the only one to recall it. Don't pay attention to my coding or variables, like for fsn which means Fucking Small Number :D<br />

So you want to make me your apprentice on how to make typical J presets? ;) Though i already know the art if you remember.<br />

Oh yes that's really uplifting ASD5A :up: And here i wasted 6 hours to perfect a incomplete preset!<br />
Im waiting for a remix now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the comments, but i gotta admit that dm is coded pretty poorly and innefieciently, i was re-learning and even learning some new stuff while doing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Did you open the bitmap in notepad too, because without that you don't really get the full keanureeves-WHOA!!! effect.</div></div><hr />

Neat preset, what's it supposed to be? it looks a bit like moving silicons :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well the base of the preset is indeed the dm, which is just a hyperlooped suck&amp;push dm, what it means is that it has 10 nods that alternate between suck (d+1) and push (d-1) (very roughly speaking). The other components are there just to generate something for the dm to work with that doesn't &quot;stand out&quot; that much if at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm so the great Tuggummi wants a remix. well alright then. a remix he shall have. give me sometime on this one my knowledge on dms is limited to the x,y,d,r but nothing fancy.<br />
plus i might just include my latest trick in making a solid clyinder from el-vis real_3d start preset heh. discovered a actual use for the | &amp; and % operators heh :D  anyway i want to ask you a question Tuggummi. If you were to make a Color Organ preset how would you do it?<br />
<br />
the cylinder is rainbow colored without a colormap :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing's worng with that, in fact it makes me understand the code way better.:p<br />
<br />
You asked for a remix Tugg. Would you mind if I try one? Of course it won't even be close to your mastermind preset but I think I can get something good, I just need sometime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Of course i reserve the right to like/dislike the remix, but i don't deny anyone the freedom to remix this preset, so go ahead :) (just give credit where credit is due like usual, especially if you include them in your future packs)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well of course if it were perfectly coded it wouldn't need any holes in it, but since... My ways are Ã¼berhax :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">love it, tiny bit dark, but i suppose that is the point. i tuned the color modifier just a hair brighter to my liking. great movement though. i love &quot;tits&quot;, i have used random words in my coding too... might have even used tits. <br />
<br />
oh and hello anyone who might know me from deviantart... i go by meaninglessexistance there... (maybe some of you may know me from a mediocre pack i submitted that got a DD a few months back). i am new and very late to any AVS forum so hello to everyone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: i found the preset where i used a random word... i used &quot;boobs&quot; in a dynamov in an extreme remix of something or other that i will include in my next pack... that i think i said would be done by yesterday about 2 weeks ago in a DA journal. oh well.</div></div><hr />
