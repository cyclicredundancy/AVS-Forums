		:confused: Hi <br />
this one is my first avs preset. It took some time to understand superscopes. I think most of the code in the dm doesn't make sense...but i have tried anyway.<br />
Just let me know how you feel about it.....any advice is welcome.:)

		For a first SS attempt, this is not so bad. You just need to smooth out the movement, which will come with practice. You know, those text affects are really oldskool now. Only use them if you are doing something unique with it. Er, someone else will tell you whether the DMs make sense. I'm not qualified to say. But in my amateur opinion, It looks like you understand superscopes a little better than the average person does when first starting. My advice: KEEP making presets! Never quit, even if you get discouraged or can't figure something out. The truth is out there. Hope to see more of you!:up:
