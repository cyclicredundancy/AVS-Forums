      :p Well some one said that I should make a preset that has to do with lemons, so I jumped right on it:)I added some of my new stuff as well;) Hope you enjoy it.<br />
      Oh! and please check out that thread that I made that no one's replying to called 'some remixes of old stuff'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I cant say i like all of them..<br />
      I like your use of curvy scopes.. but some of your backgrounds are too noisy.<br />
      <br />
      Lace: Nice idea.. but i think the scope should reset after some time instead of getting infinitely complex, like after thre or four beats...The bump looks kindov gay imo.. Actually.. if it were up to me i would rethink the whole background.. but thats jsut taste.<br />
      <br />
      Parting: Not to my liking at all.. I hate mirrors, and i hate rgb seperation.. there are exceptions of course.. but rarely. I think i cant give a fair review on this one..<br />
      <br />
      Snailfish: Same deal as lace.. very impressice forground..but the back is to fast and clashy.<br />
      <br />
      UL: I love the colours of the scope, please dont use the bump effect like that though. I honestly was excpecting more of a lemonish looking preset.<br />
      <br />
      All up.. they are generally god ideas.. lacking a bit of aesthetic polish. Lace is the nicest.<br />
      <br />
      Btw: I made this preset a while ago.. i thought it fits in with the lemon theme :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright, here's my review:<br />
      <br />
      Lace: Neat blurring effects. The scope looks like Degnic's "Geisha" presets from his last pack.<br />
      <br />
      Parting of the Sea: Try making this one a clearer image; it's called parting of the sea, try to make it look like that. (there's a lot of weird stuff going on:igor: )<br />
      <br />
      Sailfish: Wow that's a reactive DM. Good job on this one.<br />
      <br />
      The Ripening: ha that name sounds like a horror movie! The preset is a little weird though. If possible, try to make the lemon/lime scope a solid scope (such as UnConeD's "glass pyramid" preset) that might bring the FPS to it's knees, but it would look more real.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And "citrus" is really good AVS Axer! Maybe brighten up the colors more, it looks a bit dismal. And what's up with the text in the corner?:igor:</p>
