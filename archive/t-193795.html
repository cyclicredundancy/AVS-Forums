		It's been about two-and-a-halve (2.5) years since Preset Pack 1 came out and a lot has happened in the meanwhile<br />
So I'm proud to be able to present the first preview of PPII to y'all.<br />
<br />
It's kinda static, but it runs fast and has bright colors... Who's first to review?

		Nice. Both trippy and hypnotic. Its trippy in that my mind starts seeing different things in the shapes. Thats cool. Its hypnotic in the sense that it can hold my attention fairly well. The jerky border makes a great container. My mind naturally moves toward the more peaceful and watery center, and if my attention starts to wander then I bounce off the jerky walls right back to the center.<br />
<br />
The colors seem to get a bit muddled in places, but I'm not sure how I would approach the colors differently. The seperated RGB effect, for lack of better words to call it, definitely adds to the psuedo-holographic quality where my mind starts to make out 3D images within the movement.

		I like the additive blend. &amp; the water stuff reminds me of some way back old school presets.  Fairly nice work, except that its exclusively beat responsive.  I don't know how you would change this, but just something to keep in mind.

		Nice work, I like the colours and i think the movement is fine. There's just one thing i would add; a movement trans at the end to give the lines a bit of wavyness to them.

I tried adding some getspec/getosc action to the SSC, but that made it way too chaotic, and the colors less intense.<br />

I'll see if I can tweak that a bit. It would make the preset less 'square' anyway.
