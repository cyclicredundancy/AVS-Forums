      roll-up roll-up<br />
      <br />
      Thanks to nic01, magicX, jaheck and Unconed.<br />
      this whole thing was done in less than a day, those people have managed to help me out with some coding in the last few hours!<br />

      Cool idea Sid, just hardly usable. Dont have a clue where i'd need this except for a scorecounter within an avs game :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why not improve it by floating the floating point? Use ex=log10(val)-.499999;ex=(abs(ex)%(abs(ex)+1))*sign(ex); to get the floating-point-shift. Though you might still want to leave the original behaviour in so that you can switch between 'fix' and 'sci' (like a real calculator).<br />
      <br />
      Oh and I don't like the 9's with missing bottom stripe ;), change:<br />
      six=(equal(pval,0)+equal(pval,2)+equal(pval,3)+equal(pval,5)+equal(pval,6)+equal(pval,8)+equal(pval,9));<br />
      (though you should now invert it to speed it up)<br />
      <br />
      Also, 'val=abs(val);' is run per-point, this can be put at the end of per-frame.<br />
      And finally, for that fancy LED-look, set line width to 2...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, it's very cool and compact, but is it useful? :rolleyes: :)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      It has turned up one thing though: AVS uses <i>banker's rounding</i>, which rounds N.5 to the nearest even number, rather than just all up/down. So 4.5 -&gt; 4, but 5.5 -&gt; 6. That proves by you have to use .4999 to force it to round down.</p>

      <p class="post-content">eh. its not meant to be good for presets and finished products..<br />
      <br />
      its just useful when you have a crazy complicated code and you want to keep track of a variable.<br />
      nice remix.. you did that pretty quick :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Lol, i do that all the time..<br />
      <br />
      The floating point thing: i was going to do that, but got sick of fucking around. Thanks for the code, but i dont get it, so i dont know how to implement it. I had at one point started doing what you mentioned, i had flt=-1 as a floating float.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the thing about the nine, i forgot about that.. btw, you managed to pick apart my coding prety quickely, even knowing the inverting thingo. fix of your fix:<br />
      six=1-(equal(pval,1)+equal(pval,4)+equal(pval,7));<br />
      <br />
      I was going to ask you about that rounding thing, i got really confused by it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well in any case, you shouldn't expect any decent accuracy from AVS, as you can see from the readout itself ;). It seems the .49999 thing doesn't fix much for fractions, but only helps for integers.<br />
      <br />
      Here's a version with dynamic point, but you can still toggle the old behaviour by setting fix=1 in init.<br />
      <br />
      <i>ex</i> is the adjusting exponent (basically log10(abs(val)) rounded, but with signs and AVS-freaky rounding taken into account). flp is the dynamic point position, but wrapped so it never goes too far.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to go extreme, you could program it for scientific notation 1.245e+10, but that's left as an exercise for the reader :P<br />
      <br />
      PS: MagicX, you mean for e.g. an AVS pinball game?</p>

      <p class="post-content">a <b>PINBALL GAME!</b> *drooooooooooooool*<br />
      <br />
      Thats it! And possible too!!!<br />
      <br />
      We need: an input field that grabs keyboard input prog<br />
      <br />
      An ape that renders the paddles and requests the keystate from the input prog. And it renders the ball based on physics of a table and that scans for borders. If there is a border, the color defines the amount of bounce (like texer does point scanning)!<br />
      <br />
      The rest can be done through scopes!<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately this is 2 sizes too big for my programming skills and would take a looong time to work out.<br />
      <br />
      But it WILL work!<br />
      <br />
      *droooooool* :D :D :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice work, i came back on to post my fix, but it had already been done!<br />
      <br />
      my version works like this. You set the number of decimals with 'dec' in init. Or, you set 'dec' to -1, which activates the dynamic floater, which works from the left.<br />
      i fixed up the nine aswell, and made the decimals easyer to read.<br />
      <br />
      you can really see how bad that rounding glitch is, considering this example is just adding integers!.</p>

      UnConeD, you think this would work without any APE?<br />

      How would you realize the intput then?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well no, an ape would be required for the input, but that's basically it. All the stuff you talk about (flippers, collisions) is perfectly done in AVS...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, maybe i just don't get it. How would you code a Ball SSC without knowledge of the sourceframe which is needed to render a collission?<br />
      <br />
      The only thing i could imagine is that the SSC already contains the table layout. Then again, how would that go with the flippers?</p>
