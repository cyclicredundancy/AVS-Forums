			<strong>help on preset</strong><br />

		Ok, I read this three times and I still don't know what you want. Anyway, your coding is for shit. You've made it way too complicated to make a circle. Try this:<br />
<br />
init:<br />
n=50; (example)<br />
p=acos(-1);<br />
p2=p*2;<br />
size=.25; (example)<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
asp=w/h;<br />
<br />
point:<br />
r=i*p2;<br />
x=size*cos(r);<br />
y=size*sin(r)*asp;

		You sort of had the right idea but you didnt take account of the order of operations. Writing:<br />
<br />
x=r*cos(a)-.6*asp;<br />
<br />
Is the same as writing:<br />
<br />
x = (r * cos(a)) - (.6 * asp);<br />
<br />
So as you can see it will only aspect ratio correct the offset (0.6) as opposed to the whole expression. You actually want something like:<br />
<br />
x=(r*cos(a)-.6)*asp;<br />
<br />

		This has got to be the best preset i've made. its experimental.<br />
<br />
and if anyone knows who made the 3d beat ring example of the TexerII please tell me. i'm please because i used its 3d engine to make what i believe to be a hyper torus.

		From the AVS Expression Help Texer II tab:<br />
<br />
&quot;Texer II was written by Steven Wittens. Thanks to everyone at the Winamp.com forums for feedback, especially Deamon and gaekwad2 for providing the examples and Tuggummi for providing the default image.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chances are good that either Deamon or gaekwad2 provided the 3D Beat Rings example.
