      Hey, I just wanted to make space for some suggestions to the makers of AVS. I figure a colletive of constructive critism would be good for the product.<br />
      First of all, I would like the thing to show the equations for the preset movements, I can't tell how many times I've wanted to modify the sunburster or shifted swirl with having to resort to layed movements(which does some damage to the fps).<br />
      <br />
      and honestly, what can you do on the DDM that can't be done on DM? frankly I still have no Idea what the DDM does.<br />
      <br />
      Also, is there anyway they could make the docking window resizable. That would save a lot more space so you're not making adjustments, looking, making more adjustments ect.<br />
      <br />
      Where the hell do you get APE's? Is fireworks and visfractal all you get? and it would be great if the fireworks and visfractal were more customizable.<br />
      <br />
      And for christ's sake, why does pimping have to be such a process, couldn't they make a better program where you just click and drag? I'd hate to complain about it, but that's the only thing keeping me from posting my AVSes on here. frankly I think you'd all like them, huge variety.<br />
      <br />
      I'll let you guys sort out the other problems, and if you must chew me out, please do it without making me seem like an ignoramus.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I agree...</strong><br />
      I agree with you in the things you suggested.<br />
      <br />
      I would also like to have presets doing a check if the components they need are available (functions, pictures, videos), to stop winamp from crashing then. The plugins not working should simply be skipped.<br />
      <br />
      But about PIMPin... I made an installer and uninstaller using the NSIS and this thing really kicks butt! It lets you do (nearly) everything you can think of. You have to spend some time on writing and testing the script, but when it works it compresses well and is really simple to use.<br />
      You have to dive into NSIS before, but if you understood it once, you can make great packages!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>bang on.</strong><br />
      I definitely agree with those.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe also a playlist-type menu for the presets. Imagine having all the flexibility of a Winamp music playlist, but to use with the presets.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe there should also be some modes other than random for cycling through presets, i.e. forwards, backwards, every second one.. etc.<br />
      <br />
      AVS is great, but can get better still!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>dm vs dm and other features that seem to be "useless"</strong><br />
      i also was wondering why there are fx that duplicate functions of others ...<br />
      but finally i've got a conclusion.<br />
      it's for comptibility purposes.<br />
      nullsoft can't remove any old fx (like simple, osc star or movement) even if it's easy to make them using other fx, because you couldn't<br />
      load anymore old presets. of coz they could code somethin for on-fly<br />
      conversion but what for?<br />
      <br />
      anyway creating this thread was a good idea ...<br />
      <br />
      features i miss are:<br />
      - color palette cycle,<br />
      - on-beat active effects-lists (but i heard they are already coded),<br />
      - next-prev buttons active all the time,<br />
      - on beat active brightness channels,<br />
      - multiplier of skip in custom bpm which would be smaller than 1,<br />
      - jpeg,animated gif,mpeg,mov,swf support,<br />
      - and some more i can't recall in this moment ... have to find my notes,<br />
      <br />
      hope to find some of these soon in new winamp!<br />

      <p class="post-content">well okay. i can help you with one thing here. the color palette, at least in the superscope anyway.<br />
      <br />
      in the per point section just have this while keeping in mid of having the main color to stay as white:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />red=cos(x-t);<br />blue=sin(y+t);<br />green=cos(x-y);<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      thats just an example you can chage this but this WILL change the color on a superscope

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Definitely!</strong><br />
      I feel your pain rradical!<br />
      <br />
      I've found a way to get around it. If you run two video cards, you can run AVS windowed on the second card and select the window at the edge of your screen. Then the Hotkeys will function. I'm pretty sure that the hotkeys not functionning is somehow related to the problem I describe below. If the Avs window would stay "open" as a tab at the bottom of the screen of it's own as it does when winamp minimizes and Overlay mode isn't on, this would make the problem easier to avoid.<br />
      <br />
      I sort of got around this by using a two-monitor setup where one monitor is my main desktop and the second is a secondary desktop which is where I run the AVS window fullscreen to display through the projector. This way you pick where you want the second desktop to be(top, bottom, right, left) and just run the mouse off the main scren to get to it. If you bring the mouse just to the edge of the screen you can "select" the displaying window without the mouse showing up. All you need is a motherboard that has AGP and PCI slots, I'm running a 3dProphet II mx as the main card and an Ati mach 64 as the secondary with the TV-out.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Have you also noticed that there is a small glitch? If you're running AVS in a window and running it in overlay mode, the AVS window will minimise with Winamp regardless of the "do no minimize on winamp minimise" option being checked. Perhaps it's not a glitch, perhaps it's necessary, but it really would be great if you could still select whether it minimized or not with the overlay running.</p>
