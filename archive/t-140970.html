      <p class="post-content">Wow. What happened to you? I thought you were just starting AVS!<br />
      <br />
      These are really good. And I mean <b>Really Good.</b> Great job! (although the names of the presets are a bit bland)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is what I think of each of these presets.<br />
      <br />
      Bird - Fairly Nice.<br />
      <br />
      Hey - Nice.<br />
      <br />
      KALEIDOSCOPE - Very nice.<br />
      <br />
      Move v1 - OK.<br />
      <br />
      Move v2 - Better than Move v1.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>Bird</b> - Slow preset. But very nice. The sun is great - good use of an MP.<br />
      <b>Hey</b> - Hey back to ya. This is one helluva nice preset. Looks amazing - great beat reaction. The DM is awesome - creates a very nice effect from a very simple SSC. Colors are great. The only problem I have with it are the rough edges(the parts where the DM just cuts off and you just get the straight lines of color).<br />
      <b>Kaleidoscope</b> - OK, but I haven't yet seen a kaleidoscope preset I like. Would be a little better if you had a nice 3D DM and this was just a texture or something.<br />
      <b>Move v1</b> - Too many colors piled on top of eachother, and is way too blurry for my tastes. Too much use of the interference effect, as well.<br />
      <b>Move v2</b> - Nice 3D fog-like effect - looks good with this preset. Don't like that you can see the edges of the screen - try to get rid of that somehow(add another Fast Brightness there at the end to see more of what I'm talking about).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I loved Bird. Move 2 was decent also. Kalidescope was pretty good, but the others didn't do much for me.</p>
