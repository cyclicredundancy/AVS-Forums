      <p class="post-content"><strong>cannot get my list of presets and installed visuals anymore. Only works sometimes!</strong><br />
      I'll try and describe this as good as I can. When i used to start a plug-in from the main list of avs, I would right click on the circle button next to the 'random' button on the bottom of the screen that the visualization is playing in. This(only works sometimes)would bring up a list of hundreds of presets. I can't always get them when I want though. Some of my downloaded plug-ins go to this list so I don't always get to see them all.Please help me!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm a bit confused, your post wasn't all too clear to me...<br />
      <br />
      You're talking about 'downloaded plug-ins' inside the AVS preset list.<br />
      Plugins do not show up in that list: Only the directories in the /avs/ dir and .avs files are displayed.<br />
      Don't you mean preset packs? AVS 'plugins' are called <u>presets</u>, (as AVS is a plugin itself). Please refer to them correctly to prevent confusion.<br />
      <br />
      Switching between presets goes the easiest by rightclicking somewhere in the AVS window, then selecting a directory &gt; preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That little round button, which brings up a popup menu of visualization functions, is meant to be accessed with the left button. I've never tried using the right button on it, but it's logical to assume that it might bring up a different menu, one that doesn't list the hundreds of installed presets.<br />
      <br />
      I wonder if it's possible to install so many presets in one location that AVS is unable to display them. That should never happen.<br />
      <br />
      Is that even AVS in your screenshot? For some reason it looks more like Milkdrop to me. Although rather similar to AVS in many ways, that's a completely different visualization plugin, one of three included with WinAmp. You can use your preferences to confirm whether or not AVS is the currently selected visualization plugin.</p>

      Try if you can press that button on your keyboard all the way down (once is good enough).<br />
      <br />
      Then open MSpaint and go to <b>Edit</b> and select <b>Paste (Ctrl+V)</b><br />
