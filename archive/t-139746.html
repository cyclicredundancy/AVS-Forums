<div class="posttext">Yeah, so Ive been doing this for like.... a few years now<br />
and i decided it was time to share my stuff. I openly welcome anyone to do remixes or just make them better as long as credit is give where credit is due. Actually, I BEG you to make mine better!! PLEASE! ahem... Anyway some of mine arn't quite finished yet and if some of them are almost a copy of another one its b/c im experementing.<br />
<br />
On a side note, this isn't ALL my best stuff. some of my good stuff got deleted by accident. (my dad installed windows XP blah blah long story)<br />
Also Im running a pentium 4 with... i guess 128mb of RAM or something around there so my stuff may suck a lot of FPS.<br />
anyway.... here they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Please include the APE's when you post your presets.<br />
<br />
Anyways, here is my review:<br />
running - Extremely slow.  Try to optimize your code for speed.  Don't like the moving particles(MPs) or the text.  Try to find a more original alternative.<br />
shaftoflight - Very slow.  Once again - OPTIMIZATION.  Don't like the MPs.  Slightly boring as well - not much happens.<br />
something good i hope - Very very very repetitive.  You have to make the SSC be more dynamic.  <br />
vine-like - Interesting effect at first, but then it gets old.<br />
cell membrane - Try using something other than an MP.  Do that and this could be a nice preset. Oh, and don't use a pink background(looks much better with the invert enabled).  Also try to speed it up some.<br />
dynamic - Weird title considering that this preset is not dynamic - it does the same thing over and over again.  Try to make it dynamic.<br />
Earth&amp;Sky - This idea has been done many times before.  They were all done much faster as well.  You need to make this one unique and speed it up.  This preset just showed me something cool - if you use the ampersand in the filename of the preset, then AVS will give the preset the next letter as the hotkey like with windows programming - that's very cool.<br />
leafycells - Background is static - make it morph or something.  Don't use MPs in this manner - it gets really annoying.<br />
Matrix - Boring.  Seen the effect many many times before.  Try something a bit more original.<br />
MatrixSimple - Same as above.<br />
notsureyet - Very similar to other presets of yours.  Change some stuff and make the presets more interesting - this one does the same basic thing over and over again.<br />
nullsoft - A black blob moving around leaving orange where it went.  Not too interesting.  Similar to others in this &quot;pack&quot;.<br />
Working on it - Not too bad.  Try to learn how to get the camera angle to change - that will help make it more interesting.<br />
water rings - A bunch of built-ins.  Try to make something that doesn't rely solely on others coding(the SSCs and MPs, etc).  Try to make a SSC or DM of your own to give it originality.<br />
work in progress - Verrrrrry slow.  Optimization needed.  Not too interesting either.<br />
Overall:2.5.  Try to make your stuff more original, and don't use MPs and stuff nearly as much - I've just about drowned in all of the presets using MPs that all look basically the same - Try to differentiate yourself from this crowd of people.  Learning some [more] SSC and DM coding could help a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like the colours you use altho the presets are slow</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good stuff, looks pretty good, the colours and the basics for them are good but most are completely repetitive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey, well I know alot (if not all) of them suck, but the feedback is a MAJOR help so thanx. alot of them were just experiments anyway<br />
With that, i guess I'll start on my first &quot;official&quot; pack.<br />
<br />
BTW what do you consider acceptable FPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">15FPS is usually pretty good for me, but 20-30 is better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">On my 566 MhZ comp :<br />
<br />
1-3 : Slow.<br />
4-15 : Good.<br />
16-50 : Fast.<br />
51-80 : Simple single-SSC preset.<br />
81+ : Empty preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think anything around 20-30 fps is fast enough for me.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, the slowest are around 13fps for me.<br />
and I'll assume you use a window around 320x240</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I use 300x300, which is quite bigger.</div></div><hr />
