<div class="posttext">I don't know much about AVS, except that I like to look at it.  The one thing I would like to do is slow down the animations and make each one stay longer on the screen before the next one pops up.  Any easy way to do this?<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="posttext">1: Giant red letters saying to Search the forums before you post.<br />
2: Painfully obvious link to the FAQ at the top of the main forum.<br />

You managed to ignore both, so we'll ignore you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, you really like that line don't you?  Why don't you come up with your own clever phrase?:p<br />
<br />
And kokosnood, please don't call them &quot;animations&quot;.  That angers me.  They are visualizations.  Animations are generally static, and static isn't as good.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now i know you've never been here before, so i'll be lenient: SEARCH THE GOD DAMNED FORUMS... <br />
that is the example question we use when we are discussing infuriating noobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you for your kind responses ;)<br />
<br />
I had searched the forums prior to starting this thread, and hadn't found a simple answer to my query, so I thought I could save some time and ask...but I guess I should have known that experts such as yourselves wouldn't have time to reply to such a dumb question.  <br />
<br />
I figured it out, though, by poking around.  Double click on the AVS window and goto settings, presets/hotkeys.  At the bottom there is a check box for &quot;ramdomly switch presets&quot;.  below that is a field to enter the amount of time each visualization stays on the screen (notice I didn't call it an animation this time).  <br />
<br />
I admire what you guys do, this is definately a cool way to express yourselves artistically; and I love watching it.  Reminds me of a tape I used to have called fractilidescope.   I'm glad Raz_001 was lenient.  I'd hate to read a non-lenient reply  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th March 2003, 23:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you for not replying spitefully. At least now you see that it's quite simple to do what you wanted. This question is asked at least once a week and i'm at a loss as to how it didn't show up on a search query. I'm also glad you understand that avs is an art form and not just &quot;some pretty colours&quot; as most people do.<br />
<br />
Just because you're second post showed some sense and understanding and didn't flame everyone for replying harshly (is that even a word?) to your question, if you're to be making presets and coming to the forums on a regular basis, i welcome you to forums, a community, rather pissed off at seeing &quot;how do i stop avs changing questions&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Raz, harshly is a word.  I agree with you, Raz.  This n00b question has gone over much better than many other posts.<br />

<div class="posttext">Yes, yes I do like that line quite a bit ;) Fits my attitude towards life just about perfectly :p<br />

And all I can say is this...you are one fucking post pumper :p<br />

argh...too many smileys for such a small space.  :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Try making one of your own.  It's great, but you use it too much for something that isn't your own.  This is just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Postpumper???  I make some pointless posts, but I mainly stick to the current topic or discuss something related that is somewhat important.  Making a lot of posts and postpumping aren't the same thing.  A good example of a postpumper is nobby nobbs(who openly admits it), but dlinkwit27 has been posting even more than me recently and he does not post pump.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think I might make a book on AVS.  Sell it at Barnes and Noble.  Might bring about some more recognition for AVS.  Would take a lot of time though.:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you were going to write a book on avs you'd need to have in depth knowledge of the source code and basically have the know-how to re-program the entire thing from scratch to make a whole book about it. Or at least UnConeD's level of knowledge of what actually happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th March 2003, 21:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I know.  I still may make a primer.  Maybe a slightly more advanced tutorial than Atero's for the next-level noobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th March 2003, 22:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i would leave it for now and wait for some sort of update, something like that takes time and an update would probably come soon after rendering all your hard work (well at least a lot of it) useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I wouldn't call it a primer.  Just a tutorial or something.  First I'm going to need to learn raytracing and such, though.  It would probably outline a lot of the coding stuff instead of the other effects.  I would go into detail of the useful math and science stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">science is used in AVS?<br />
<br />
(well, physics I suppose could be counted as a science, but I don't think learning chemistry will improve my AVS skills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th March 2003, 00:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, i was referring mostly to physics, although the life-algorithms are very loosely based on biology, and the atom preset I am working on is based slightly on chemistry, but some branches of physics incorporate them as well.<br />
<br />
Mainly, I would go into discussing collisions(bet you couldn't have guessed that), as well as the basic ideas of position, velocity, and acceleration, and different ways to realistically model them in AVS.</div></div><hr />

Jeez, that was a bit uncalled for.<br />
<br />
BTW, we can't really complain about this question. The kicker is &quot;how do I turn them off?&quot;. Nobody that I know of has ever asked &quot;how do I enlarge the time difference?&quot; But maybe that's just my pedantic ass doing what it does best again. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You're around the middle.<br />

I would probably makee something for the advanced n00b/established AVS'er that allows them to take their stuff to the next level.  First I have to get to the next level myself.:p</div></div><hr />
