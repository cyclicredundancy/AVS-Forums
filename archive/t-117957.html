      Of course you do, so give me a hoot about this one.<br />
      <br />
      It's friggen FAST on my comp, getting to be between 19 and 21 on the frame/sec counter ...<br />
      <br />
      Heh at least it's not like my hyper-active superscope, crap that baby was burying the needle at 30...<br />
      <br />
      But anyway, any suggestions, code or whatever just whatever you have to say, unless it's not good cause I don't give a crap and will ignore you anyway. Leave your negativity out of it!</p>

      See that's exaclty why I am here, well this topic anyway. This is my craziest avs with too much speed(in first post), it needs to take a "chill-pill"(hah I haven't said that in years!) Anyway, I was just hoping the smarter people here could help out. See because this one's so fast and unbalanced (well which is kinda my style) I just went over-board and have been stumped for ... uhh... about a week i think.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Side Note: I don't give a flying fuck what people think about my avs'. If I like 'em that's all that matters. Ratings are over-rated! (heh) The crowd that doesn't respect my work, isn't the crowd I was attempting to please. The crowd I am attempting to please would be anyone who likes to look at avs' without an "oh i only like these kinds of avs, so i hate that one because i am bias jerk-face" ... yerrp that's about it ...(btw this isn't directed at any of you ... yet =] )<br />
      <br />
      But thanks anyway guys, and here just to prove that I'm not some chaotic dm maker here check this one out(in this post), it's one of my fav's.<br />
      <br />
      This will be in my pack once I have enough to make a nice sized pack. I've only been avs-ing for about uh? 3 weeks or maybe a month ... chuck that into your equation and smoke it! =]</p>

      <p class="post-content">I always say this but try and smooth out the transitions a bit. Even if fast jumpyness is your style you can still make things change quickly without it being instantaneous. Specifically I'm talking about your DM. An easy way to do this is to make dx and dy 'targeting' variables by doing something like this:<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      <br />
      dx=0.9*dx+0.1*tdx;<br />
      dy=0.9*dy+0.1*tdy;<br />
      <br />
      beat:<br />
      <br />
      tdx=(((rand(100)-50)*.01)/1)+.03;<br />
      tdy=(((rand(100)-50)*.1)*.2)+.03;<br />
      <br />
      this way dx and dy don't instantly change. To make them change faster/slower simply change the 0.9 and 0.1 to different values which are positive and add up to 1. For example dx=0.5*dx+0.5*tdx; is a much faster change and 0.98*dx+0.02*tdx; is much slower.<br />
      <br />
      The other thing I would recommend is to empty the effect list out into 'main', just because it is faster and doesn't make to much of a difference to the apperance of the preset.<br />
      <br />
      The only qualm that I have with hyper-fast presets is that not all music is fast and so a fast preset will look out of place when listening to chilled music. Its better to try and make your presets react so that they are faster for mor intense or loud music and slower/less intense for slow music. It can be quite hard to do it successfully but I always try to do that in my presets.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to see high fps you should check out my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=124675" target="_blank">J7</a> pack, it comes with a highres bonus pack, some of those presets get over 100fps in 'normal' resolutions like 320x240 on my 1GHz POS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it's cool, actually. My advice: Make the preset more colorful, and more music-responsive. And figure out what you're doing...rand(1.000005*tpi) is just about useless :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm figure out what I am doing eh? No shit! Gee I thought that's what coming to these forums was all about. I have a better idea, kiss my grits! My presets are fukking amazing for someone who only graduated grade 12 general level math and has only been playing around with it for maybe a month or so. jheriko :) was the only one with any damned advice, and I thank him for that, even if it was for the wrong one at least he isn't a jerk!(Thanks jheriko!)

Pull your head out of your asses, stop trying to be better and just help a fellow avsers out! I guess there just isn't any respect around here unless you have 3 years of university math.

      <p class="post-content">... tsk tsk, you take me too seriously. See the whole:</p>

      <blockquote>
        I must ask you to disregard the above statement made by myself.
      </blockquote>And the:

      <blockquote>
        DO NOT TAKE MY ABOVE POST SERIOUSLY IT <u>DOES NOT</u> REFLECT MY TRUE VEIWS!
      </blockquote>See I thought that it would clear up the little rant, which was

      <blockquote>
        purely hypothetical. ;) :p :D
      </blockquote>Whatever, since you definetly took me serious I apologize for your misunderstanding ... if that makes any sense.<br />
      <br />
      And the whole "comparing myself to UnConeD" thing ... hell I couldn't compare myself to someone I didn't know, plus that was just a joke too. Sorry for the confusion. (I guess I am just weird ... or something)<br />
      <br />
      HAH! Postal he says ... shit that's not postal, it was all a joke, see no one said anything bad about the avs. I just know it's destined for greatness that's all, just looking for ideas really, a lil' help, you know ... assistance. Plus it's better to vent, and publicly vent I might add, because people who bottle their anger, annoyances, problems(and all that stuff) up go crazy and eventually kill people and/or themselves.<br />
      <br />
      See everyone here is actually pretty cool and I don't have a problem with any of you.<br />
      <br />
      Yak Yak Blah Blah Blah, it's just one of those things ya know, brush it under the carpet and everything will be alright. Geez, I don't think I could explain it any more than that ... don't go to sleep tonight thinking I was serious...<br />
      <br />
      Hmm ... next time I'll add the unoriginal [SARCASM] [/SARCASM] so people do not get confused.

      <br />
      In my experience not many people like flashy/fast presets, to a person who understands some/most of how AVS works they tend to look like bugs rather than presets. No offense, but ask anyone. Like using Trans/Invert without 'clear every frame'... talk about a bad idea.</p>

      The first preset is way too messy, looks random and there is nothing I could focus my view to. I dont think it has much potential and you schould start over.<br />

      I shot the sherrif, the deputy and anyone who looked at me funny after reading this thread and after viewing this preset. Xenibalt choo is one fucken crazy chopper, I like ya.<br />
      <br />
      Your preset had a similar effect on me as fight club the moofie did. eg. My friends and I all proceeded to beat the shit out of each other.<br />
      <br />
      Fricken Crawzy I recomend using rediculos lines of code in your scopes whereever possible, why not make pi=2.7182818. Its not pi but then again neither is a cheese cake. Did you want the recipie? I can help you out there....<br />

      Anyways...<br />
      <br />
      First preset :<br />
      <br />
      Like others said, too chaotic - Perhaps making the chaotic movement stop on beat (I doubt it's possible on DMs, but you can use 1-frame-per-beat on fx list with replace input, buffer save, ignore output. Put everything in an fx list in order, with new previous list in bottom, set output to ignore, and add another buffersafe in bottom. Set it to restore buffer). The colors can use some work, and I suggest a slow fadeout. The chaos shows *some* promise sometimes when stopped, but it's not too good either. Check the coding, too.<br />
      <br />
      Second preset : Nice adjustable blend output trick (Though I believe someone else had tried that). I suggest tinkering with the colors (Put the list in another list before using outside effects!), and smoothing the DM change (This is optional - If you want to make a rather relaxing preset, this might help). I also suggest a little colording in SSC and making it something other than some flashy lines. Put the comment outside the list, too :p<br />
      <br />
      Bottom line : You're starting to tinker with coding - That's good, if you learn coding - But try to learn some aesthetics - It will make the viewers that much happier to view your presets.<br />
