<div class="posttext">Hi betush22,<br />
<br />
- set up your LCD as a second screen (Extended desktop) <br />
- best to make set it as small as possible (640x480, or maybe 800x400 if you're feeling confident) <br />
- start winamp and AVS<br />
- resize the AVS window to be as big as you've set your LCD screen<br />
- drag it over so it completely covers your second screen<br />
<br />
Voila!<br />
Don't forget to tell all your friend about AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You have discovered AVS, that is wonderful, AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement, it is a fun tool to play with and it is a great thing to watch at while you play your favourite music. <br />
<br />
However you have asked a AVS related question that has been asked &amp; answered several times before. Here in the AVS forums we respect and value such skills as:<br />

Simply put: Search before you post, you might have already seen the bold red letters above the posting window, or you might have missed them for some reason, maybe red isn't a striking or alarming color to you. By searching for the answer you're looking for, you will get the answer you want immediately, instead of posting a question that has been posted before and waiting for a reply which usually takes several hours, sometimes even days to get and it might not even be a reply you will appreciate.<br />

Striving to be an AVS artist? That is wonderful. Have a question about how to make something in AVS? Before you post this question it is recommended and expected by other AVS artists that you read the AVS tutorials enlisted here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060), before you post your question. The tutorials are a wonderful source created by long time AVS artists to learn the basics and sometimes even the more complex features of AVS. Realize that since this is a hobby for most of us, no one is going to hold your hand and teach you AVS from ground up. Believe it or not, but all of us have learned AVS by ourselves, some of the people who have been AVS artists for years didn't even have these wonderful tutorials at disposal and we had to learn everything by experimenting! You are indeed lucky to have such great resources available to you, use them well and wisely, but most importantly read them before you ask.<br />
<br />
Remember these guidelines and you should have no problems in your AVS future. And welcome to the AVS forums :up:<br />

<div class="posttext">Listen, I have a question that needs an answer and it would be great if i could get it soon.  Can I download a plug in for winamp like AVS and be able to use it in Windows Media Center.  Under My Music i can watch a visual but i can only use the ones that come with MP 10 and i know winamp is much better and would love to use it in Media Center. Thanks...</div></div><hr />
