(And learning a little in the process.)<br />

		Some of your presets are extremly flashy, they blink violently. This is a big no-no, not only does it look pretty awful and hurt the eyes, it can literllay give people with epilepsy seizures.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the pws remix. Juts changing the fadeout colour does not make a remix, espicially when it seems to have little effect on the preset.<br />
<br />
Finally, try and steer clear of the preset effects, and try to learn how to use the SSC and DM etc.

		Which ones flash? I just went through them all again, and I certainly don't see any that flash violently enough to cause an epileptic seizure. But tell me which ones please, so I can fix them.<br />
<br />
I wasn't sure if the PWS remix would fly or not; now I have the answer. I will change it accordingly. <br />
<br />
I have been trying to learn dm. There are presets here that use it. I believe I said I still suck, I am trying to learn. (I am not sure what you mean by ssc.)

		ssc = <b>S</b>uper<b>SC</b>ope<br />
the most powerful effects in avs are <i>'superscope'</i> and <i>'dynamic movement'</i>. You can create nearly everything using those two objects (erm.. and the needed skills of course ;) ).<br />
<br />
well, i guess m_w means something like 'flickering'. your presets show too many quick changes in shape or color (or both), they are jerky somehow. try to produce more smooth/soft effects. :cool:<br />
<br />
besides, all in all you're getting more versatile in use of effects!

		i know its a bit late but the only one that does not hurt my eyes is hyper space. I like your presets but they are very VERY flashing.

		See, I just don't understand, maybe we all have different definitions of 'flashing'. Because on my comp, I swear to you Hyperspace is the one that flashes the MOST. or do you mean not smooth/jerky?

		yeah 'energy gather' doesn't flash/flicker/.. at all. but the others have some kind of too fast flashing/wobbling or so. but never mind, you'll get the hang of it! :)

		I really appreciate the feedback, ^..^ I don't mean to sound defensive so much, but it just seems like you're the only one on this board who takes the time to explain what somebody might be doing wrong.

		well, i'm just a pretty cheerful guy. :D<br />
<font size="1">(as long as the opposite one is also well-disposed towards me, of course) ;)</font><br />
<br />
Besides you have to take into consideration, that some of the people around here come to this part of the forum for years now, and they have explained all the stuff thousand times before...

		I do take that into consideration. But I think that they should remember what it was like to not know anything. Pak-9 or guys like that don't come in here saying, &quot;you damn noob! You should know that crap!&quot; Well, not usually.:D I know nobody said that to me either, I guess I am defensive sometimes. Forgive me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't begrudge anyone their opinion. It does let me know what I need to work on. So thank you guys, too mikonthestick and mysterious_w.:)

		of course, getting feedback is essential for good progress, so it's quite a pitty that only a few people comment on others. But all in all there aint many people here.. hmm kind of a vicious circle.. :hang:

		as ^..^ insightfully pointed out most of the educated AVS artists have seen the same noob presets and made the same 'dont make strobes' 'dont use RGB colours' etc... comments a thousand times. The problem is there is a level of ability in AVS that you need to reach before you can start producing presets that are worthy of critique, that is why there are tutorials out there to help you reach that level.<br />
<br />
If you really value 1 on 1 tutoring I suggest you go to one of the IRC channels and nicely ask for some 1 on 1 advice, some people are happy to help and you will get much quicker feedback. Try:<br />
<br />
#AVS on freenode<br />
#finnish-flash on Quakenet (much cooler but ruled with an iron fist by the heartless demon Sandvagius)<br />
<br />
Its always hard to become skilled at something (and with AVS its harder now than it used to be), but remember most good AVS'rs got where they are off their own back, so they don't have much sypathy for people whining about how hard it is. We had a big discussion about this in a thread a while ago, I would link it but I cant be bothered to search for it.

		you damn noob! You should know that crap!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you can say that you have been said this :p<br />
<br />
What PAK-9 said sums it up pretty well, anything is hard at first and especially if it's something that's been &quot;around&quot; a while since it has most likely developed a steady community behind it with skillful people dedicated to that subject.<br />
<br />
And what i think should be said is that only a very small percentage have actually followed the guideline: &quot;learn, experiment &amp; create something worthwhile and don't post your first presets EVER&quot; I can only think about a few people who's first presets weren't noobish. However, some of us posted their first preset 4-6 <b>years</b> ago when AVS was still relatively small and being developed, so it was okay  <i>then</i> to post them, but it's not okay to post n00b presets today, because the standards are way much higher for various reasons already said.<br />
<br />
It's a tough game entering AVS nowadays and gaining respect from the &quot;elder ones&quot;, but if that's your only goal then there's something wrong and maybe you shouldn't AVS at all.

		As soon as I posted that 'damn noob' comment, I knew someone would say it to me.:D<br />
<br />
No that's not my only goal. I just had no other way of gauging my progress. I guess now I am ok to be judging my own presets.<br />
Thank you guys, and you will never see another preset from me until I think it's amazing.
