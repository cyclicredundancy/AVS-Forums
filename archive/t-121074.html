Mabey this can be the single preset review thread??<br />

I like staring at this one for hours. If you saw it in the what do you do 4 inspiration thread its the same one. I just want to know what other ppl think of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice work visag, it is addictive to stare at. The colours are a little grey though, also looks kinda simplistic at first but looks more complicated as you stare at it longer. What did you do, i cant stop looking at it now, ahh. ;) lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th January 2003, 16:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Its decent visag.  Take out the color cycler in the superscopes - use red/green/blue instead so it is beat responsive. n can be dropped to 100. ra=rand(9)+1*.01; can be changed to ra=rand(9); and should change every beat.  The bleedin' movement doesn't do much either.  The main SS is also very repetitive.  Put in some on beat changes.<br />
Overall I give it a 2.5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">anubis: The rand function is taking a number fron zero to 9 than adding 1 to make it between 1 and 10 then multiplying it by .01 to make it a decimal number, so .01 to .1 . R u saying that it doesnt need to be in that range for effect or it's wrong coding?? The cycling colous are there from one of my other muckaround presets that I changed I dont think it actually needs to cycle. So was the bleedin I haccidentally left that in there:o. Yeh bit lazy I guess thanks for the n tip I didn't think of that (preformance)...The beat detection is a great idea for the SSC because I had an eclipsoid shape in the previous unmodified code with the spectrum going inwards and it looked like a water mirror pool, I liked it but would like to change between the two seperate codes .. btw is that a 2.5 out of five ??? I hope not of 10 or 100 :cry: <br />
<br />
RAZ_001: :) Thanks I'm glad you got something out of it. I kind of like the slight greyness of the colours It's intentional. I find it kinder on the eyes than 80's flurofantastichappypantsness .<br />
<br />
The two things I would like to get a bit of a tute on is the red green blue comands and how they work and beat detection in those functions and in SSC. I understand how to use them in the on beat window but how do you get it to swap to a totaly seperate x= and y= code (SSC)??..  <br />
<br />
I'm losing it a bit with DM's I have printed out (and studied) some of Nic01's posts to cmountford and it's all on basics of DM'ing. They stopped and went on to SSC's just as it was getting interesting (lots of work went into that btw)nice 1. Has Nic01 or anyone else got some tutes for DM's that are a bit more advanced than simulating default movements and just getting slightly beyond that (dancehall effects and such). <br />
I'm looking at learning things to make my head turn as emulating the basics used to and good personal tips on how to LAYOUT your code to keep it on track for more advanced code.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to remix it feel free just give me cred if u use it.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, 2.5 is out of 5. The code you have will make a random number between .1 and 8.1 because multiplications are carried out before additions.  To make a random number between .01 and .1 use ra=(rand(10)+1)*.01;<br />
Red/Green/Blue are variables that can be used to set the color of a superscope.  They are each in the range of 0(none of that color) to 1(All of that color). Combinations of more than one will lead to different colors (i.e. Red + Blue = Purple). To do this you can use any other variables to define them per pixel or per frame(if you want the entire scope to be one color). For example to make red increase from left to right you can put at the end of the pixel editbox &quot;red=x;&quot; or to make it decrease from left to right use &quot;red=-x;&quot;.<br />
A better way to use it is to use on beat changes.  In the onbeat box you can put something like &quot;dr=rand(100)/100;&quot; and then in the frame editbox you can put &quot;red=.9*red+.1*dr;&quot;. You can do this with the other colors to create a smoothly changing color that changes on beat.  This can also be used to change the x and y variables or anything you want.<br />
The easiest way to have it switch on beat between two different SSCs is to use something like this:<br />
<br />
Init: g=0;<br />
Beat: g=bnot(g);<br />
Pixel: x=g*&lt;x1&gt;+bnot(g)*&lt;x2&gt;; y=g*&lt;y1&gt;+bnot(g)*&lt;y2&gt;;<br />
<br />
This will change sharply on beat (at least I think so) and I would tell you how to make it change smoothly but Winamp crashed on me so I can't check to make sure I'm right.<br />
I hope this helps Visag.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yes thank U. Ok , what about if you want it to change every [(100) any number} of beats???</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You could either put a custom BPM before it or use something like this:<br />
&lt;EDIT&gt;<br />
Beat: tg=tg+1; g=if(equal(tg%&lt;number_of_beats&gt;,0),bnot(g),g);<br />

I haven't released any packs but I have had some presets up in the forums recently.<br />
Here's some others that I've made recently.  They aren't finished (they are still just bits and pieces) but they might help you. I'm also adding the others that I have put on the forums.</div></div><hr />

Since this is kind of a free forum...<br />
im gonna post up a AVS :D<br />
tell me what you think..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad kid, its just a tad annoying and repetitive but not too bad, the colours are kinda nice. Youve got an empty movement that dosent seem to do anything in the end effect list and most of the time roto blitters can be quite easily substituted with simple DM's, otherwise, keep em coming. :) <br />
<br />
Heres my latest attempt seeming as this has turned into a single preset thred, I love the colours and the outlining effect in this, ill probably replace the moving particles with superscopes when i can be bothered but here it is anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th January 2003, 02:42</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Not bad raz. The colorfade yields some boring results(blurry and no outlines) sometimes but not too bad of an effect overall. I've seen a similar effect done a different way but I can't remember what preset it was in.  If I can find it, I'll let you know so maybe you can change the colorfade.<br />
Try using a superscope (doesn't even need to be complicated) instead of moving particles.  It would be a bit more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks annubis your always a big help.<br />
<br />
Ok ive improved it quite a bit, used a superscope and changed around the effects so it goes from the outlined thing to a blurry phsycadelia thing more smoothly, oh and ive made the background white too, looks better IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th January 2003, 05:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Much better raz.  The only improvement I can think of is to make the SSC more beat responsive (change shape(n),rotation speed/direction,etc.) Good Job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice Idea kid keep at it. Take my advise -- instead of putting a render simple in there. firstly learn superscopes go for the real basics. <br />
<br />
Start ya off ... wick-ed (http://www.xoasis.com/~soulcatalyst/superscope/index.html) <br />
<br />
make your self a circle and mess with the &quot;v&quot; variable or something the similar like divide it by a number or multiply or another variable in the expression help list. That link is the first place I ever looked. All so look at Atero's sig if your so inclined and get his primer, if you do ,you may be as good as him one day if not better..<br />
<br />
Raz nice colours man nearly look excatly as my part preset cept for the colour clip, wicked ! To keep it supersonic tho try cahnging the movement code a bit more &quot;flowie&quot; for a star SSC.<br />
<br />
d=d/1.04; r=r+0.1*cos(d*x-(y-r)+(r+x));<br />
<br />
I think it works by having a x,y  + and -  in the rotational code (r,variable) with out totaly changing your code.<br />
<br />
I just typed it in in two seconds to extend the work that the line of kode does.. it seemed a bit still. (2 sec, not much effort huh, mabey when I'm a bit more awake)<br />
<br />
Go bro <br />

<br />
Synch two solid circular superscopes. Make them rotate around the center. There have been discusions on how do do rotation before. This sums it up nicely.<br />
<br />
link (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=95432&amp;highlight=rotation)<br />
<br />
Don't clear the screen so the colours will stay. The circles will overwrite whatever colour is already there.<br />
<br />
That should give you a bit of a ying-yang.</div></div><hr />
