      Hey this is my first attempt at anything avs releated. I've been lurking for a while and I think I have well over 50 avs packs on my computer so I've been learning for awhile. I've messed around with AVS and I now have a few presets I though I would share. Keep in mind however most (if not all) my presets lean more towards the minimalist side of things, so yeah. (Actually that's just an excuse for why they suck so much).<br />
      <br />
      Enjoy and comments, etc. are greatly appreciated!</p>
