<div class="posttext">so and so... nothing great here but some that were ok and one good preset: &quot;Round And Round&quot; is really good imo!<br />
<br />
others I liked somehow:<br />
Joe<br />
ZzDummy<br />
Tracer Of Science<br />
First Generation<br />
<br />
&quot;Random Flashes Of Annoying Light&quot; could need some color- as well as style tweaking, but apart from that, ok, watchable.<br />
<br />
You're kinda lucky I like flashy stuff as well. Many AVSers today don't [correct me if I'm wrong folks, but it seems to me]!<br />

<div class="posttext">I like flashyness if it's intentional and if it doesn't hurt my eyes like a stroboscope would.<br />
<br />
I liked kaleidovision because it's the preset I never was able to get tuned like this when I first began.<br />
<br />
quite a lot of RGB-colorschemes in this pack though, try to get more different colors in your presets.<br />
<br />
I'd rate this pack as a good way to start off from... You have yet a lot to learn; enjoy it ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So, should I work on it or release it? I feel it's ready but what about you guys/gals?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you cant impress us old guys with that pack...<br />
however the most important thing about the first few packs is the stuff you learn by makeing them</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">See releasing it as adding it to your personal gallery..<br />
do you think it represents you at this moment?<br />
-If so, publish it.<br />
-If not, polish it up and release it later.. noone can make you release it within a deadline.<br />
<br />
Don't be too harsh on youself if you think you're not good enough.. everyone needs to start somewhere.</div></div><hr />
