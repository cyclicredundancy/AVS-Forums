      Well haven't made anything in a while and Bitmapped II is coming slow (8 presets ready) so i thought id submit something else :)<br />
      <br />
      It's a Galaxy/Milkyway/Vortex thingie with a scrolling star background... (now that's original...) Anyway, not quite sure does the background fit with it that well, so i will gladly hear any suggestion (the ones i can make, so it means no 3D!).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <font size="1"><br />
      Btw. If you remix it, don't just change the colors, because i will shot you down with my mighty forum flaming abilities :p Try to do something different to it...<br /></font></p>

      <p class="post-content">Great preset Tuggummi:<br />
      the preset is good, but it works slow on my pc,<br />
      I think the background should be a bit fast,<br />
      the galaxy thing is good, the colours are great !!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Uhm... Don't expect Bitmapped II to work on your computer... well not alteast fast! :p I got one preset that works 16fps in my 280x280 window with a 1.73 ghz Athlon XP :rolleyes:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I love the stars. The galaxy just looks like a big blob though. Messing with the output mode of the color map produces some interesting effects. Not sure if it would cause errors, though. Something is wrong with color map, and I'm not sure exactly what. Also, have the dots in the galaxy move, not jump.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well the stars don't actually "jump" they fadeout and fadein in a different position which i thought could smooth up the feeling of it...<br />
      <br />
      Maybe i should take the beat detection off from the galaxy... since it tends to look really bad with low framerates.</p>

      <p class="post-content">In order to make that a good preset, I think the cubes should be able to pass eachother up. Difficult to do, but otherwise it defeats the purpose of a race. Seeing one cube whoop up on another isn't that interesting(IMO).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I spend about 8/7 on the internet. These forums are normally minimized - check them every now and then. I make presets whenever I come up with an idea/way to complete one of my previous ideas.</p>
