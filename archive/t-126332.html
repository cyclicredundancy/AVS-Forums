<div class="posttext">Well haven't made anything in a while and Bitmapped II is coming slow (8 presets ready) so i thought id submit something else :)<br />
<br />
It's a Galaxy/Milkyway/Vortex thingie with a scrolling star background... (now that's original...) Anyway, not quite sure does the background fit with it that well, so i will gladly hear any suggestion (the ones i can make, so it means no 3D!).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw. If you remix it, don't just change the colors, because i will shot you down with my mighty forum flaming abilities :p Try to do something different to it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Great preset Tuggummi:<br />
the preset is good, but it works slow on my pc, <br />
I think the background should be a bit fast,<br />
the galaxy thing is good, the colours are great !!<br />

<div class="posttext">Uhm... Don't expect Bitmapped II to work on your computer... well not alteast fast! :p I got one preset that works 16fps in my 280x280 window with a 1.73 ghz Athlon XP :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I love the stars.  The galaxy just looks like a big blob though.  Messing with the output mode of the color map produces some interesting effects.  Not sure if it would cause errors, though.  Something is wrong with color map, and I'm not sure exactly what.  Also, have the dots in the galaxy move, not jump.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well the stars don't actually &quot;jump&quot; they fadeout and fadein in a different position which i thought could smooth up the feeling of it...<br />
<br />
Maybe i should take the beat detection off from the galaxy... since it tends to look really bad with low framerates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cool! It twists a bit too fast for my taste, though. I wouldn't want to be on one of those planets in there... :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tugg, don't take out the beat responsiveness in it - just make them move slowly from point to point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Waw :) Its great ! Those colors are perfect and the background is really nice...Great work dude! Here`s smth i done while i was bored.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad phaze, but could be better. Here's the result of me toying around with your preset for a couple of minutes :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It looks very much like an older preset of mine(barbecue) :) The water effect is nice but i dont like the red too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th February 2003, 10:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah i know barbeque :)<br />
I thought &quot;it's murder&quot; needed to move a bit more so that's why i edited it a bit, and well because i was bored :blah: :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think the main thing behind AVS is being bored...Oh look :) I got bored and did smth else :) Btw Tony Hawk 3 has some really nice pictures(of decks) that you can use for AVS.I suggest you try looking if you have it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In order to make that a good preset, I think the cubes should be able to pass eachother up.  Difficult to do, but otherwise it defeats the purpose of a race.  Seeing one cube whoop up on another isn't that interesting(IMO).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Anubis - You really spend 24/7 on this forum, don't you?... Where do you find the time to actually make presets? :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I spend about 8/7 on the internet.  These forums are normally minimized - check them every now and then.  I make presets whenever I come up with an idea/way to complete one of my previous ideas.</div></div><hr />
