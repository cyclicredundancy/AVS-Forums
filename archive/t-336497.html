      <p class="post-content">probably because whoever was reviewing preset packs isn't doing it anymore or just cba to do it. i can push them through with a default "thanks" with a 3 star rating if needed...<br />

      <p class="post-content">i see 3 in the queue which i presume are related to you (though am sure there were more but they seem to have gone from the queue):<br />
      the full circle 10th anniversary<br />
      Seramony<br />
      VISBOT - 1999 a.d.<br />
      <br />
      so like before, i can do a default review or wait for WoTL, etc to look at them (though one appears to be from Dec 2010...).<br />
