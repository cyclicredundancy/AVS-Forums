      I really like AVS and I wish I could watch it while working in Word. The Overlay mode works well towards this end - however - it frequently changes the background color too much. What I would like is that the overlay image consist of a blend of the original color and the AVS image. This way I can retain a mostly white background on my Word document and still see a "bleached out" AVS visualization. [In some sense this visual effect can be achieved using alpha blending - however, stretching the AVS window over my screen makes the mouse useless.]<br />
      <br />
      Implementing this would require a new slider under AVS-&gt;Settings-&gt;Display and a minimal amount of color blending code. (I would like to blend with the overlay color - maybe others would prefer to blend with another color - which would require another color selector.)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for all your great work,<br />

      </blockquote>Afaik overlay uses some specific accelerated feature to do that color replacement, and generally blending it would actually be non trivial as you dont have access to some global on screen buffer, or anything else which makes it particularly possible to implement this without major code effort.<br />
      <br />
      Although there is one quick fix for additive blending with the overlay color, which is to simply add it to every pixel in the framebuffer as a final stage before render if overlay is enabled.<br />
      <br />
      Nice idea tho I doubt it will ever be implemented... if its so simple, d/l the code and do it yourself, no?
