<div class="posttext">i have a preset ready for avs thats beed sitting around for over a year. i at one time gave a good try at creating a PiMP file for the presets but failed. (i've also failed to wrap my little mind around maki and just about anything else that deals with any level of coding)<br />
i'm wondering if anyone here can whip up a simple PiMP for my presets. i'de be very greatful and i've always wanted to get them out to the public.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i'll post a zip file here when i gat back to my home computer in a hr or 2.<br />
<br />
all comments are very welcome. <br />
i have also used other avs's as templates and built them up form there. at that time i was never thinking of realising them to the public so i saw no problem with it. now however i need to give cridit where its dew. unfortunatly i dont have proper documentation for all my avs's so if anyone recognizes a ape or the use of a specific line of mathimatical preseats in one of my avs's please give me note to who i should give cridit to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Be sure to put it in the presets forum :). Make sure you repeat that line about needing info on credit, some people are very protective of their stuff if there's no credit... ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Decent presets,some of them really nice.Favourites : Cripton, It`s Alive, Lava Red and Purple Haze.Remember to give credit when needed(like using UnConeD`s sphere DM and no credits).Nice job...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Asthetically thay're quite decetn as a whole. Some whited out a little much, some look too much like others for my taste. You use a lot of effects in your presets. That slows things down. There have been a coupe of APEs written recetly that do things faster and are more versatile than the builtins in AVS that you might want to look into; the convolution filter and picture 2 for example.<br />
<br />
You might want to take a look at coding your own effects in movements and DMs, and making some custom scopes. Doing that will open up a whole new world.</div></div><hr />
