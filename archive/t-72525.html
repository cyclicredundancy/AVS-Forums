      <p class="post-content"><strong>Comet of Destruction</strong><br />
      Hello again everyone.<br />
      <br />
      I have another new preset for you to check out. It is called "Comet of Destruction."<br />
      <br />
      Tell me what you think!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      By the way, it seems to run fairly slowly if you make the window too large, but I have only tried running this in WinAmp 3, so maybe that is why it is running slow.<br />
      <br />
      Feedback on speed when in a large window would be appreciated too.<br />
      <br />
      Thanx,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Not bad. I like it, but I feel it lacks enough on-beat movement. May I attempt to do a remix of it?</p>

      However, if I release another pack anytime soon, I might want to use it. LOL.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>The Ragnarok Remix</strong><br />
      Here is my remix, Ragnarok. I tried to create a color blending effect that you would find pleasing. If you wish, you have my permission to release it in your pack. Tell me what you think.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Interesting</strong><br />
      That is an interesting AVS. I like it!<br />
      <br />
      It works better than the original. Thanx for the remix! I'll probably use it in the next pack I release, which is already up to 3 presets!<br />
      <br />
      :)<br />

      The rainbow pool one, this one, and what was the other one I had...oh, the one I sent you. :)</p>
