      It's a dot, but its movement is pretty cool.<br />
      Could easily become a shape.<br />
      <br />
      It seems to bounce off the walls, and accelerate when at low speed, without a fixed direction of gravity.<br />
      <br />
      No amazing code to do this, just was playing with a SSC I used in my upcoming pack, and noticed this somehow. I saw potential.<br />
      <br />
      If this is really not the way to introduce such a thing I'll gladly succumb to the flames and do something.<br />
      <br />
      cheers, jessej</p>
