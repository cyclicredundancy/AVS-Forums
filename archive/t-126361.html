      Thus you deserve the best treatment available for such problems. To paraphrase UnConeD:<br />
      1) Sticky "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS" thread at the top of the forum<br />
      2) Big, bold, red letters saying <b><font color="red">Search the forum before you post</font></b> right in front of you when you posted.<br />
      <br />
      You ignored both, so we'll ignore you.</p>
