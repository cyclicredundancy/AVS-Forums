      <p class="post-content">So I kind of liked that starscope, but it annoyed me, with its squishy, non-aspect-ratio corrected looks. Couldn't resist toying with it!<br />
      <br />
      I thought of using depth-coloring + fat lines + edge detection to get a nice fake depth-correct outlining (i.E. with correct obscuring), which sort of worked (just do red=constant/z and edge detect). Then I thought it would maybe be neat if I was filled in.<br />
      <br />
      So I cleaned up your starcode and wrote a filler. Then I noticed it looked pretty darn l33t without the outlines ;).<br />
      <br />
      SO here's a nice mix... looks wicked IMHO, and has a subtle, politically incorrect undertone :rolleyes:. And it's fast too.<br />
      <br />
      (I accidentally deleted the original comment, so feel free to add it if you want to include it in a pack or something).</p>

      Sorry I took so long to get this thing out. Hope it doesn't defame you. :)<br />
      <br />
      Yathoso:<br />
      That's what you get when the Nullsoft staff does the AVS reviews. I'm a little put out that a pack with waaay too many fyrewurx got a better mark, but hey, it's out there now and I'm happy for that.<br />
      <br />
      Unconed:<br />
      Hey man, that's pretty nice man. (first UCD mix, I'm so proud :) ) Looks like you rewrote a good portion of the code. It was made while I was still learning 3D, hence the only having 2 rotations equation sets and no aspect ratio correction.<br />
      <br />
      As to the political correctness of it, whatever. It looks cool and that's why we all do this, isn't it? Guess I should watch Donnie Darko to catch the reference. It's laying around here somewhere. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm I played around with it some more... The main star is now copied before output, so there are always 4 main ones, and I fake-anti-aliased them by offsetting the movement one half pixel in each direction. I also tweaked the additive color.<br />
      <br />
      I prefer it this way. This reminds me a LOT of 16-bit console platform games, with endless fields of stars, bananas, rings or whatever to pick up. :cool:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I remixed Unconed's remix. Added some low end response, and got rid of the tiling, and channel shifted.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice lil pack here Jaheckelsafar :up:<br />
      You got a grip on things, but some presets didn't quite match my taste or had not so good 'side effects' to go with your scopes &amp; dm's.Â´<br />
      But still i think also that it could've deserved atleast 3,5 or if we count the remixes, then 4 :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Tuggummi. But there's nothing to be done about it now.<br />
      <br />
      Nice mixes guys. Wish I had those earlier. :)</p>
