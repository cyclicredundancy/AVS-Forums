      <p class="post-content">Hiya.<br />
      I don't post in here too often, but I've been working on an AVS pack. There were a couple things I wanted to know:<br />
      How many presets would you expect to have in a pack?<br />
      What's the largest (filesize) pack you would be bothered to d/l?<br />
      How large do you run AVS (windowed).<br />
      And how good are your computers (so I can simplify some of my crazier presets <a href="http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif</a>)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and I've made an animated gif showing all my presets so far (One five second long frame for each one). It's 232kb. Would you mind me posting it?<br />
      <br />
      Once again: Thanks!<a href="http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif</a></p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hiya</strong><br />
      Well,<br />
      <br />
      I'm pretty new here, but I'm running an athlon 850. I think 10-20 is usually a good number for a pack, although if they're particularily spectacular I always want more!..<br />
      <br />
      I wouldn't mind you posting the image, but I don't know the board's policy.. I actually posted one of some of mine in the two graphics cards thread.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Hope to see some soon<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">In my two packs I've done 10 presets in each. Do as many as you want. I don't like to see too many, rather a few quality ones.<br />
      <br />
      Avs presets are only small, even when pimped. Unless you add pictures that are used in your presets. Then it's only a few hundred kb at most.<br />
      <br />
      I don't usually have avs open, but when I do to create presets or whatever I use a small window. (So it runs faster.)</p>

      To all: What do you think of my presets? (above) Any ones that I shouldn't include? Any colour changes etc.?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeeeah, I see some converts from skins to AVS, hmmm, welcome my child to the chosen groop of both skinners and AVS artists :D:D:D:D:D:D:D.<br />
      I put about 20-25 presets in my packs.</p>

      The ones above (in the pic, it's animated) are what I've made so far. What do you think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice, but I gotta see them in action first. I saw a couple of packs with 100 presets (Yay Fatboy's). I make that number of presets (well at least 60 :D), but most of them are unpublishable :D.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a P3 @ 500 MHz with 192 MB RAM! I ususally make my presets at 176&#195;&#8212;176 resolution and here's the # of presets I have in each of my collections!<br />
      <br />
      Insane AVS 1* : 12<br />
      Insane AVS 2* : 25<br />
      <br />
      * Insane AVS 1 and Insane AVS 2 are merged into one, known as Insane AVS 1 - 2, which is published on Winamp's web site! The file size for that collection is 334Kb!<br />
      <br />
      I also uploaded Insane AVS 3 a few days ago and it has 50 presets, but the size is 1.5 Mb, due to the fact that I got 16 SVP's, 4 APE's, 8 ASC's, 1 BMP, 3 fonts, and a documentation!</p>

      <br />
      That's where you'll find my Insane AVS 1 - 2 collection! Mind ya, here's some things to be warned about!<br />
      <br />
      Instead of the directory that pops up in the installer, just copy it to C:! And the extra AVS folder created in the AVS directory has the directories with all my presets and it has the necessary SVP's and APE's!</p>

      Anyway. Anyone wanna put a comment there; tell me what you think?<br />
      Oh yah. Minor things: Does the Staff rating hold more weight than public ratings? And how does the rating system round? (Does it round up or down, or is it just normal rounding?)<br />
      'cos by my reckoning the rating should have gone up half a star (to four. I said it was minor<a href="http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif</a>)</p>
