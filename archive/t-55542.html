<div class="posttext">Hiya.<br />
I don't post in here too often, but I've been working on an AVS pack. There were a couple things I wanted to know:<br />
How many presets would you expect to have in a pack?<br />
What's the largest (filesize) pack you would be bothered to d/l?<br />
How large do you run AVS (windowed).<br />
And how good are your computers (so I can simplify some of my crazier presets http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Oh, and I've made an animated gif showing all my presets so far (One five second long frame for each one). It's 232kb. Would you mind me posting it?<br />
<br />
Once again: Thanks!http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well,<br />
<br />
 I'm pretty new here, but I'm running an athlon 850. I think 10-20 is usually a good number for a pack, although if they're particularily spectacular I always want more!.. <br />
<br />
 I wouldn't mind you posting the image, but I don't know the board's policy.. I actually posted one of some of mine in the two graphics cards thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Hope to see some soon</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks. I did the pic in the same was as yours. Here it is:<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">In my two packs I've done 10 presets in each. Do as many as you want. I don't like to see too many, rather a few quality ones.<br />
<br />
Avs presets are only small, even when pimped. Unless you add pictures that are used in your presets. Then it's only a few hundred kb at most. <br />
<br />
I don't usually have avs open, but when I do to create presets or whatever I use a small window. (So it runs faster.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks Matt! That's everything I needed to know. http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif<br />
<br />
To all: What do you think of my presets? (above) Any ones that I shouldn't include? Any colour changes etc.?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeeeah, I see some converts from skins to AVS, hmmm, welcome my child to the chosen groop of both skinners and AVS artists :D:D:D:D:D:D:D.<br />
I put about 20-25 presets in my packs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">flatmatt</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th July 2001, 01:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I like 26 presets in each of my packs.  Why?  I don't know.  My AVS is currently 368x273.  1GHz 128 MB RAM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i make like 20 in mine, you should see how meny bluetape2k1 puts in his :D (round number of 60-80 :EEK:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Lucid DM</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th July 2001, 03:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jeeze. How can anyone possibly make that many presets ?! http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif<br />
The ones above (in the pic, it's animated) are what I've made so far. What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th July 2001, 10:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice, but I gotta see them in action first. I saw a couple of packs with 100 presets (Yay Fatboy's). I make that number of presets (well at least 60 :D), but most of them are unpublishable :D.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have a P3 @ 500 MHz with 192 MB RAM!  I ususally make my presets at 176Ã—176 resolution and here's the # of presets I have in each of my collections!<br />
<br />
Insane AVS 1* : 12<br />
Insane AVS 2* : 25<br />
<br />
* Insane AVS 1 and Insane AVS 2 are merged into one, known as Insane AVS 1 - 2, which is published on Winamp's web site!  The file size for that collection is 334Kb!<br />
<br />
I also uploaded Insane AVS 3 a few days ago and it has 50 presets, but the size is 1.5 Mb, due to the fact that I got 16 SVP's, 4 APE's, 8 ASC's, 1 BMP, 3 fonts, and a documentation!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well can u at least have links to those fuckers?<br />
<br />

<br />
That's where you'll find my Insane AVS 1 - 2 collection!  Mind ya, here's some things to be warned about!<br />
<br />
Instead of the directory that pops up in the installer, just copy it to C:!  And the extra AVS folder created in the AVS directory has the directories with all my presets and it has the necessary SVP's and APE's!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks Dog http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif. I haven't lookd in here for a while. There's a link in my sig as well (the -|- thing).<br />
Anyway. Anyone wanna put a comment there; tell me what you think?<br />
Oh yah. Minor things: Does the Staff rating hold more weight than public ratings? And how does the rating system round? (Does it round up or down, or is it just normal rounding?)<br />
'cos by my reckoning the rating should have gone up half a star (to four. I said it was minorhttp://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just checked out your pack Lucid, and my review says it all, you used too much Mosaic and Grain, otherwise nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Blast it!  I forgot to backup two of the preset collections I was working on, Insane AVS 3.01 and Insane AVS 4 - Ka-LIED-0-Scop!  I must've lost about 20 presets when a Trojan horse virus wrecked my PC to hell!</div></div><hr />
