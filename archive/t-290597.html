		firstly, things move very slowly around here, don't be dissapointed if you dont get a reply for a week.<br />
secondly, upload the preset file itself in a .zip

		where to start..<br />
there's a lot of things that need fixing.<br />
firstly, never ever ever ever ever ever use an invert trans when clear every frame isn't checked. this is probably why after 20 seconds it just turns into a flashing screen.<br />
also, try to smooth movements out as much as you can to get rid of jerkyness.<br />
thridly, needs more colour. try to avoid 100% reds/greens/blues/yellows etc at all costs, they just look ugly unless used properly. aim for more muted pastel colours, and match them tastefully.<br />
i think that's enough to work on for the moment.<br />
good luck!

		phoenix is looking better, royal arch doesn't display anything.<br />
next what you should try, is removing everything that doesn't have a noticeable effect on the preset. with phoenix you can delete the first 10 or so effects.<br />
the key is cleanness in your effects list = cleanness in your preset. also the more stuff you can kill, the faster your preset will run.<br />
still need to work on those colours though. use colours that are very similar and then just one or two 'feature' colours.<br />
one more thing, bass spin renders are awful, avoid them at all costs.<br />
also, there's a couple of picture renders in there, are we missing a .bmp file? you'll need to include that as well

		yes, i dont really like the bass spin effect on its own hence why its in the background, i was trying to simulate police car strobes<br />
<br />
ok, didnt realise you had to include the images, thats probly why nothing worked on royal arch :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'll include them next upload:up:

		i assume the preset has no code at all?<br />
<br />
my tip for you is to code. all the most impressive things are team efforts as well... at least imo.<br />
<br />
e.g. the typical super awesome preset will have:<br />
<br />
been made by PAK-9<br />
using TomyLobo's triangle APE to render<br />
a model loaded with my global variable manager APE<br />
which is complimented with sprites rendered by UnConeD's Texer II<br />
<br />
doing all of this is dependent on code and uses code that other avs artists have authored.<br />
<br />
code is the key!<br />
<br />
