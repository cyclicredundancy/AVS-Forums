      <p class="post-content">Good offering neo. Nice variety. Some could use work; but then isn't that always the case?<br />
      <br />
      Try and develop some of your own movements now. Remember, the superscope, though intimidating at first sight, is your friend.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The Superscope is a VJ's best weapon. Not as clumsy or random as a Simple...<br />
      <br />
      You can do many things with superscopes alone. For example I made a SS which is actually 4 SS's which alternate every TI beats, takes TS frames to 'morph' into each other, has an rotation/scaling offset, and a HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness) system of colouring the points :D<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately I made it at a friends house, I'll upload it for all you VJ's to play with soon :)<br />
      <br />
      Newbie Tip: Put "pi=3.141592654;" in your SS/DM and use pi instead of writing all the digits.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi thanx for you're posts. i shall try to use the Superscope.. hmm though i don't understand the programming language much..:(<br />
      <br />
      I was not thinking about one thing as i made the AVSes<br />
      i work on a 1800+ Athlon with 512mb DDR ram. adn a Geforce3 Ti500.:D<br />
      <br />
      So some AVS could look weird or slow on a less computer.<br />
      I think i should think on that on too.<br />
      <br />
      Well see you later. Byebye ~NEO<br />
      <br />
      PS please keep writing i could use much more Tips and tricks on AVS making. thanx you all.<br />
