<div class="posttext">so avs is dead I heard... So, who cares? I've always liked Tuggummi's 'Club Seizure' and modified it a little. But since avs is dead noone will read this anyhow...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice attitude <br />
Having read the 'r.i.p.' post in the forum I was only being sarcastic w/r to that... ;-) For me avs surely is just as alive as any other plugin. And yes: not much has changed. Of course - it's a damn good preset imo and the only thing I wasn't too happy with was the quick movement, so I just changed that.<br />
In the commentary I therefore wrote:<br />
[...] A slightly modified version of [...] 'Club Seizure'. Most of it stays unchanged however [...] <br />
I probably should have mentioned that in my post as well!<br />
I thought, probably s.o. out there felt similar about the club seizure, so I also dropped this here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">n=750.. did you do that or was it tug? also multiplier is widely considered an obsolete effect, you can do the same with convolution filter</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i like it man, the only thing i would have done different is the multiplier, I would have used 8x</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well it's more flexible and can be combined with existing convo-fx (e.g. blur, relief).. it's explained in les noobiens' d.i.y. (http://noobism.visbot.net) packt</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">n=750.. did you do that or was it tug?<br />
nope, that was all Tuggummi.<br />
i like it man<br />
... and I'm glad I'm not alone. For everything else: I have no idea whatsoever a multiplier, a convolution filter or a flux capacitor might be. I was just messing around and liked the outcome... ;)<br />
cya</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, it's pretty much the same preset as the original, only renamed and movement speed changed. As a note I did this preset ages ago before globalvars, gettime() and other fancy things, so at that time with those computers it was working correctly and the speed wasn't blinding even though the movement was ment to be very fast (wouldn't be much of a seizure otherwise :p).</div></div><hr />
