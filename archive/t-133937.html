		this is cool, but wtf is that floating thing?<br />
<br />
your movement on the moon should be more synchronized with the earth movement and the earth should be brighter

		Heh, that's a cool looking preset. I don't know what the hell that orb thing is, but I like it. Just work on optimization and synchronization, because I know that it could be faster and each individual part could be more in tune with the rest.

		shreyas, i have noticed that you seem to never be able to see shit in peoples presets, these could help:<br />
<br />
*running high resolutions on old shitty monitors often makes the screen darker. If you have a decent video card you can tweak the color settings. (for gforce, goto properties, settings, advanced, nview, advanced, colour adjustment.)<br />
<br />
*in avs, try different fullscreen res, see the colour difference to see what i mean, also you may want to try out several comps. + you can always tweak the preset to give more brightness.<br />
<br />
*you may be going blind!! Have you noticed yourself start running around aimlessly, running into light poles, or finding your self trying to connect to the internet on your tv/microwave/cardboard box or pet.??

		shreyas, try looking at a preset more than 5 seconds, thank you. Or maybe you forgot to extract the bitmaps to your avs folder before viewing the preset...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a nice preset, a bit slow, but nice. Tho the sphere-what-ever-that-is thing is bothering a lot since it doesn't look so great.
