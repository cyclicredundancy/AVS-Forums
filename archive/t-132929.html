<div class="posttext">a kind of better version of purple sunset. of course it needs more work, because it's looks a bit boring... any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmmmm, yeah, looks great! . . . but there's something missing.<br />
<br />
I think your best bet would to have another renderer in the ocean's surface . . . something like sea foam.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i agree with nemo,the preset looks awesome but it needs something more.You decide what :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">looking at it at the first time, I thought you had used voxels! great preset though...:up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I love the visuals but it's too slow, boring slow. I know you're trying to be realistic but sometimes you have to bend realism to fit what you're trying to do. A metaphor or a preset representing something real can only go so far, otherwise it'd be the same thing. Also make the sky change colour a little, not that whole night and day thing it's been done but just some colours, make it interesting. ALso like nemo said another render in the sea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think it looks great, tho the &quot;seafoam&quot; idea by nemo isn't a bad one so give it a try. Otherwise i don't see it needs anything, it's perfect and beautiful by now :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wouldn't sea foam be by a shore?  What if you could create a shore.... If the foam were out in the middle of nowhere, it would like kind of dumb (in my opinion)<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm giving you &quot;coding cramps&quot; zamuz:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, i have seen foam in the middle of the sea :confused: (or was it my imagination)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">zamuz</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th May 2003, 02:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, foam in the middle of the sea would be weird, but a shore would be really hard, at least for me. maybe i'll add a stormy sky, you know with lightning, dark sky and stuff :)<br />
<br />
edit: if you have more ideas, remix it ;) i'm not really good at 3D stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th May 2003, 03:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i dont think you need to touch the sea at all, it looks perfect how it is with some slow music, trip hop, sigor-ros.. etc.<br />
maybe the stormy sky, but only if you can pull it off well.<br />
i started to do a remix, but i keep fucking it up, so im not gonna change it any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">added stormy sky :) it's kinda darker now, cause the lightning wouldn't show up good if it was brighter. maybe not as pretty as before, but cool anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This looks Neat, NEAT I say ! Especially that storm mix looks s√ºper (it haves this cool kind of feeling in it) but the first one looks good as well ! Decent job as usual</div></div><hr />
