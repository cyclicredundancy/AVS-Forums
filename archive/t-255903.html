      I've been messing with these for a while, but I'm still learning. Any ideas for improvements are welcome. But be gentle or at least leave some money on the dresser.;)<br />
      <br />
      Note: I did base two of these on work by the great s_kupers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Still pretty basic, but overall it looks good. :up:<br />
      <br />
      Electrick has a nice 'ghostly' feeling over it and the colors are good.<br />
      <br />
      Goldeneye's colors are great! just a bit too bright with louder music.<br />
      <br />
      Peace is great.. it's just that that 'invert' gives me a headache.<br />
      <br />
      Not bad for a first release. If you want to make a pack, I suggest you only put in either rize or endless path, not both. And aim for like 15-20 presets in it..<br />
      <br />
      I also recommend that you put comments in your presets, so that you can tell us more about the preset, claim your copyright, tell us what we could use for remixing etc.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm going to agree with WoTL on this pack. but i give you great reveiw because of your effort in each preset. i'm impressed with some of them. the rest however are way to slow. i tryed fixing one of them up but to no avail but anyway the reason i liked your work is because it looked so much like mine when it first started. stay in the forums and learn from the others is my suggestion for you because i see greatness in you.</p>
