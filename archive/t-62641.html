			<strong>Cool Equations</strong><br />
		
		

		I thought starting a thread of equations for use in diff AVS components would be handy for inspiration, the math inept, and such<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>ANYONE USING EQUATIONS FOUND IN THIS THREAD, PLEASE GIVE CREDIT TO WHOEVER POSTED IT, MUCH APPRECIATED.</b></font><br />
<br />
Try using this in a super scope, its a fractal equation<br />
INT: n=800<br />
FRAME: t=t-0.05<br />
PER POINT: d=(3*i)+rt; r=t+id; x=cos(r)*d; y=sin(r)*d<br />
<br />
its wild because the scope will draw out a fractal as it goes, you can see it in action in my avs pack, Infectious AVS v1.0 (still awaiting review) the preset is called: Fractal Inspired 3

		i improved on your code<br />
d=(3*i)+sin(r+t)+v; r=t+i+d; x=cos(r)*d; y=sin(r)*d<br />
<br />
the 'tr' doesnt do anything sense its a empty variable and its not r*t<br />
and so is 'id'<br />
<br />
meaning: rt != r*t   &amp;   id != i*d

		that makes a nice effect, but it doesnt draw the fractal that way, anywho your's looks cool, reminds me of curves and colors screen saver for windows:) thnx for the rt !=r*t schtuff too, most helpfull

		this has the same effect as my first equation, only the line curves:<br />
<br />
d=(3*i)+rt; r=t+i*d; x=cos(r)*d; y=sin(r)*d<br />
only difference is i use i*d in the r=  instead of id<br />
<br />
however this will lock up avs on me<br />
d=(3*i)+r*t; r=t+i*d; x=cos(r)*d; y=sin(r)*d<br />
putting  ^ that astriks is what causes it, why?? it will not work as r and r*t crashes, but rt works if r is not the product of r and t then what is the variable rt??<br />
<br />
anywho enough about mine, anyone else got some nifty schtuff?

		well rt and id are basically variables that are 0 not anything
