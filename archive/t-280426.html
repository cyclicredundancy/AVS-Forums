<div class="posttext">any way of using avs to grab the currently playing songs album cover and do stuff with it<br />
<br />
here take a look at this screenshot<br />
<br />

<br />
see the top two pictures with the album cover, and beat detection vis built onto the bottom... .that would be pretty cool in winamp.. is it possible?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Unless you feel like updating AVS, no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thats a bit crap then oh well</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sadly that sort of plugin is interesting but avs is not designed to do that sort of stuff.<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
1 avs is for visualization purposes only<br />
2 a connection through the internet to retrieve a covers image would make avs slower then crap.<br />
3 if you want the cover image on the avs screen i suggest you scan it then use picture.ape to render it then do whatever you like to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">no my suggestion wasn't for avs to start downloading album covers.. it was more of a connection to use existing album covers.. much like how winamp now actually has album cover support to check if album covers exist.. the avs could sort of go through winamp to pull in an album cover if it existed, if not.. use default image selected... <br />
<br />
other than that is it possible for avs to make those type of beat detection bars like at the bottom of that album cover? if not i guess this is pointless and either needs more developtment or something else to come in a do a better job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">on the bars yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well thats good then.. now just AVS to support album covers and then AVS presets doing stuff with album covers to get things started ..and that would be cool</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Question.<br />
<br />
The picture you gave us showing the bars.<br />
What music program are you using.<br />
<br />
Because somethings are copy righted in the look and the way it reacts. and if i choose to make this sort of effect i need to know i won't get in trouble because the bars have to be on a program that is in the freeware category or i won't try it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Despite all the naysaying it would be very simple to write an APE for this purpose. If you could get ahold of the Picture2.ape source you are 90% done.<br />
<br />
Assuming you are not a programmer, the only difficult part is finding a C++ coder willing to help you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i'm no C++ programming.. really should be though.<br />
<br />
anyway I won't let this thread die.. BUMP BUMP.. common must be someone who could add this..I don't think anyone could say this wouldn't be a bad addition to the AVS plugin. I really want to see it added somehow whether its on the AVS plugin or not ,I don't really care now.<br />
<br />
Call to winamp devs perhaps...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">even if i could help you, that attitude of your's isn't too motivating. to be honest, try looking in a programmer's forum because you won't find practical help here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Koogle i'll have to be on Yaths side on this one.<br />
You started out nicely then became hostile when people started turning the idea down. go to a cpp forum and ask there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey look.. you guys pick and choose who ever side you wanna be on.. I couldn't careless, and if this doesn't ever get developed for winamp or AVS doesn't bother me in the slightest.. I won't be asking around for it.. it would have been good however, anyway will let this thread sink into winamps oblivion now.</div></div><hr />
