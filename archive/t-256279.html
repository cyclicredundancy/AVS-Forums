      i meant for you to pm that info. sorry if that causes any trouble. anyway i manged to shrink the package. heres a slightly modded version. the .jpg must be in the avs directory for the triforce 3d preset to work properly. the true triforce preset is somthing you might like.</p>

      <p class="post-content">HAHA I really liked the "true triforce" man, it's great!!<br />
      <br />
      now, the other one, is lacking something, but is good too!!!<br />
      thanks man!<br />
      <br />
      But let me explain to you something, what I tried to do, was the tri-force before they combine into those three-golden-triagles-thing you know? Like flying freely on the screen, just like my original preset, but with the Z-axis...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Try to do that please. Oh, and don't worry, I didn't receive any spams hehe!</p>

      <p class="post-content">heh now that will take some time to figure out. because the rendering of something like that will slow the preset down somewhat. heh thx.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, I can wait hehe!<br />
      <br />
      You don't have to do the three points combine into the golden triangles, I don't know if you undestood that =)<br />
      <br />
      Just make then coming towards the screen, or better yet, if it's possible, make then pass trought the scree, and after make the screen "look up", ... I'll made some draws here I'll post it in a few minutes, just to explain better!</p>

      Do you remember the game, right after you beat the first boss inside the deku tree? When you beat it, the deku tree tell you the triforce story and stuff, do you remember that part?</p>
