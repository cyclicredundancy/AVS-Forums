      <p class="post-content"><strong>Forum search broken?</strong><br />
      With all the questions getting asked despite of the FAQ, it hit me that maybe stuff might not be as easy to find as we think it is. So I fired up the Forum search, did a few queries and noticed almost nothing returned results.<br />
      <br />
      So I picked a random post from about a month ago (my 'Updated APEs' thread) and entered two keywords from that post ('MMX Tentacles') into the search box. And behold, nothing was found.<br />
      <br />
      Then I tried the same with a random post in the Winamp3 Discussions forum (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=108598&amp;highlight=netslave+unload+correctly" target="_blank">link</a>, the last post in the thread), and exactly the same happened: nothing was found ('netslave unload correctly'). Note that when using the keywords 'netslave unload', that post *is* found.<br />
      <br />
      Is this a known bug? I suggest others do the same: pick a random post, a few words unique to that post and try to locate it. Most of the time, it doesn't work for me. And it happens both when searching just a specific forum as well as all forums.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and where exactly is the place for posting this kind of stuff? I am not going to post it in General Discussions to have it be lost between some guy's favourite chili recipe and sexual positions.</p>

      I know what you mean.:)<br />

      I wanted a winamp site/forum forum set up to ask question just like this but there was no interest. *sigh* things are so slow in the winamp boards sometimes.:)
