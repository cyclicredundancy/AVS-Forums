<div class="posttext">hello everyone. <br />
<br />
and thanks for the attitude i was given by some bigshot poster in this board the other day...<br />
<br />
i'm just totally new to avs (that stands for audiovisualizer, right?). where did this whole thing start? how can i learn to make one? i saw a post about some linear equations... <br />
<br />
where are the guidelines for this stuff? i want to make some of those neat visuals. there are too many bad ones that come with winamp.<br />
<br />
so anyone who can... clue me in.<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

Don't let crabiness get you down. Lots of people ask how do you do this, that, and the other thing. Sometimes people just explode. You're not the first it's happened to, and you won't be the last.<br />
<br />
You can find some good stuff in links off the FAQ thread at the top of the forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When, after you've spent your free time collecting useful AVS resources, writing up an entire list of frequently asked questions, some lamer comes along asking the same old question again, it does get pretty frustrating.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if you had a note on your door that said &quot;Don't ring after 1 am&quot; in big, red letters, and people still blatantly ignored it, because the first thing they saw was the bell, not the note?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, it's pretty annoying. i know it happens in the boards that i used to post on, but it seems better to give a link with no comment, than to blow up on someone... 'cause like we all know, it's going to happen again. it's like they say: if you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all. but i guess that gets wiped out when you have the ability to say anything you want with (basically) no repercusions. <br />
<br />
in the future i will try to read more before i ask, and i admit, i didnt put much time into looking for the answers before i asked the question, but try to be a little nicer.<br />
<br />
patience is a virtue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Question: If this happened a lot on other forums you used to visit, and you (I assume) didn't like it when it happened there, why didn't you bother to look for the FAQ here instead of annoying the regulars here the way you were annoyed at your old forums?<br />
<br />
Another question: Why are you telling us to have patience when you don't have any yourself?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually it sucks to give a link with no comment, because that way you give people the answer without telling them how to find it. The next time, they'll just do exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

Firstly you got attitude for doing something that annoys us all.<br />
Secondly if you don't want to get attitude yourself then lose *your* attitude. <br />
(BTW, that 'bigshot poster' is probably the most respected member of the AVS community)<br />

I don't know where this whole thing started since I am fairly new around here myself. If you want to learn avs the best way is to look at existing presets and figure out how they work for yourself, the second thing to do is to look at the threads referenced in the FAQ. There are a few more threads around where you can get some other useful information, there a few linked too in this thread (which was started by a model noob)<br />
<br />

<br />
That post about linear equations I'm guessing was the one where I was trying to show Xion how to do simple superscopes. You can convert any 'graph' to AVS superscope by using x=2*i-1; and then putting the y function after it, if it isn't linear you'll need n&gt;2.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that you will probably have to do most of your learning for yourself. I learned almost everything I now know about AVS without the help of these forums or any readmes or FAQs, I'm sure that everyone learns the basics themselves then comes here when they get stuck on something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok, ok... i apologize. i already did metion that i didnt spend too much time searching for sources before i posted, it was rather hasty of me. i didnt really think i would understand anything, since i dont know anything to begin with. all i saw was things i didnt understand, and for the most part saw threads where people knew what they were talking about (except for the minor detail that they didnt understand, which is what they posted about), but now that i have looked at the FAQs i see that they are explained as simply as possible for something that isnt really, or at first at least. nevertheless, thanks for the links.<br />
<br />
sorry!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Apology gladly accepted. I can understand that when everyone complains, it does seem like an awful lot of annoyance and we don't want to scare you off or anything. We're quite a happy bunch here.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the forums and I look forward to seeing your work. Please post it in the AVS preset section when you have something cool, so we can take a look and help you if needed. Oh and if you find more resources that weren't mentioned in the FAQ, please send me a note (hit the 'pm' button below my post), because I maintain that FAQ.</div></div><hr />
