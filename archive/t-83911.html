<div class="posttext">Just curious as to whether it's possible to get antialiasing on pixel doubling (in fullscreen mode) under windows xp??<br />
<br />
It used to work fine under windows 98. <br />
<br />
I usually use 800x600 32 bit color in pixeldoubling mode, but im forced to use 640x480 at 23 bit (non pixel doubled) or higher so it doesnt look so blocky, and most of my presets run really slow at that res as their fairly complicated.<br />
<br />
Is it a compatibility problem with WinXP's directx or is it a bug in the plugin??</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, first off, you're using a non-standard colour depth. :P<br />
<br />
Second, yo're using a higher resolution. 800x600 w/ pixel doubling is, inessence, 400x300. 640x480 is more pixels to calculate.<br />
<br />
That's all I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I understand that Jaheckelsafar, but i used to be able to run 800x600 in pixeldouble mode, and it used to look like 400x300 with antialiasing so it didnt look blocky...under xp it looks dodgy. Ive actually asked a few friends of mine who have xp and it seems to be either the directx version, a bug in avs, or the nvidia drivers for xp not supporting the antialiasing for avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not sure what you mean by anti-aliasing, but AVS supports no such thing. Perhaps you're referring to the bilinear filtering that you get with using fullscreen overlay mode?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bilinear filtering was what i was talking about (couldnt think of the right term) but i used to get that in fullscreen mode under windows 98...it also works in overlay mode, but the colors seem a bit blurred. <br />
<br />
Ive tried different versions of the nvidia display drivers..from the built in windows xp drivers to the latest detonator drivers with no luck, im beginning to think its something to do with the version of directx that xp comes with..and as i cant switch back to directx 7 i'll have to wait till directx 9 comes out and hope that adresses the problem..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well I've never seen bilinear filtering on regular fullscreen resolutions... that sounds a bit annoying to me really :). Overlay does indeed affect the colours (for some weird reason... seems it uses a weird bilinear filtering algorithm). Can't help you though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Under win98 with dirextx 8, the nvidia detonator drivers and a geforce2 it seems to work (had a friend try it and same thing happened)...but with the same hardware and xp with dirextx 8.1 it doesnt..800x600 pixel doubled looks exactly the same as 400x300..where as i had some sort of filtering in 32bit color under 98 in pixel double mode...cant seem to figure out why it worked on one os and not the other...<br />
<br />
It looks like overlay mode without the weird colors, and looks much better than running low res.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It just sounds very weird to me that, instead of going into a regular fullscreen mode, the drivers would purposely filter the screen. Especially because the 800x600 pixel-doubled mode might look the same as 400x300, but internally AVS is really drawing an 800x600 image. If your drivers were to filter this, then that means that other high resolutions would look blurry too.<br />
<br />
You could try taking a screenshot on your friend's PC and study it in a paint program from up close... I also know that most LCD screens use bilinear filtering because they have only one resolution. For example, when a 1024x768 LCD displays a 800x600 resolution, it uses bilinear filtering to stretch the image. Maybe that's something to have in mind too?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'll have to put a new partition on my hard drive and re-install 98 and take a few screenshots...<br />
<br />
I dont use an lcd screen either..so i know its not that causing it..</div></div><hr />
