		Learn how to do alpha blending to fix the background.  You can search the forums first to figure it out and if you still have questions just PM me.

		ok first off you need to learn how to put it all into one DM, the concept is there but its very hard to modify it with 3d camera rotation and alpha blending if its in 3 different DM's Like anubis said you need to learn alpha blending. Its all been explained before. I can see improvements and development, not bad... <br />
<br />
Ive attatched my 2 planes preset (code much improved and optimised since the last time i posted it), dont mind the shit background ive not made one suitable yet. Take a look at it, it'l look daunting at first but once you look closer its not that bad.

		Yheah, that's pretty much it. Make it one DM and blend out the far bits. My planes DM is in the call for help thread in the main forum if it'll help.

		I`ll learn dont worry ;) But cant i use a ssc to create a foggy effect ? Or mask the background ? I`ve seen it done in tunnel presets and maybe it will work here too :)

		In the first dm use only 1x1 grid size, look just as the same, because your using wrap and works faster.<br />
<br />
In the second dm use 1x33, because you're not really using any x coordinates, again some speed up.<br />
<br />
And use 1x1 in the final dm too, no difference whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the fog add a buffer save 2 &amp; a render clear screen above the second dynamove and use buffer 2 as a source for that dynamove. Then just add the code: alpha=sqr(y) into the pixel section of the dynamove. You can use multiply to make the fog sharper example: alpha=sqr(y)*10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh hell, might as well attach the file into this too :)

		Like this?<br />
<br />
This isn't the ideal way to do it becase you're moving afer all the translation and distortion. I prefer to do it all before.

		I've got a question too: <br />
When using the z=y*6-5; x=x/z; y=y/z mov, the will ceiling move towards you when the floor moves away from you.<br />
That is, when you use the right stuff underneath it. Is there an easy way to fix that? Like, say, both the sky and the road move in the correct direction?

		Yup.<br />

x=x2/z2+sign(z2)*mx;<br />
y=y3/z2+sign(z2)*my;
