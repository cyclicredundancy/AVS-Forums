		This is probably the most boring preset ever, but I liked it so much that I had to post it. There is nothing else to say, but: Read the Comment! ;)

		Hey, i like it too :)<br />
It's cool and it's perfect for the slower &amp; softer tunes even i have a few ;)<br />
<br />
Good work :up:<br />
<br />
hmm, maybe make the brightness or number of rays as a interactive feature? (sliders) Then it would be easy for non-artist avs users to adjust it like they want :)

		@tuggumi: yep, i also thought about this, but i was too lazy. maybe i'll do that today.<br />
@tomy: i didn't want to spoil the atmosphere. :p i tried, but it's hard to make a background that fits.

		Wow, pretty damned cool especially since it has &quot;first time&quot; &amp; &quot;in a hurry&quot; :D<br />
In short, im loving the interface! Very very cool idea! My simple sliders look so ugly now :( ;)<br />
Great that you decided to try out the interactivity :up:
