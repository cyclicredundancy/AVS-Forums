		This is more likely to be a WinAmp problem than an AVS problem. There's an easy way to tell: Look at WinAmp's spectrum analyzer and/or beat indicator (assuming either of them are visible in your current skin). If that's not moving, then something else is wrong.<br />
<br />
Does this affect only some file types, or all of them?<br />
<br />
Some of the recent versions of WinAmp have a bug that causes some tracker formats (S3M, MOD, IT files, et cetera) to not generate visualization data. Digital sound files, such as WAV, MP3 and OGG files, aren't affected by this. You can tell the difference in WinAmp's spectrum analyzer; if you have different file types, it'll work for some files and not for others. (I had this problem with WinAmp 5.094, but I was able to find a link to a fixed version of in_wm.dll elsewhere on the WinAmp message board.)<br />
<br />
You might also have a similar problem with MIDI files. Because of the way they're synthesized, there usually isn't a good way to get vis data from those. WinAmp can cheat, however, by recording the music from your sound card as it's being played by the same sound card. Nifty trick, but you'll need to configure it (in the MIDI input plugin's options) for it to work.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's possible that something completely different might be wrong. I'm just making guesses here. (I don't even work here.)

		I'm having the same problem myself. The spectrum analyzer is showing properly, but the AVS is just usually blank, all one color and won't react to music. Occasionally it will work but if I close Winamp it won't work the next time I open it.

		Nevermind. I think I've figured it out. I changed my Data Execution Prevention (DEP) settings to allow winamp and it seems to have solved it.

		My visualisations were always blank and adding Winamp to the DEP exception list solved the problem.<br />
<br />
In fact, turning DEP off seems to solve a wide range of problems. So far I've attributed freezes, random crashes and general weirdness to DEP, so it pays to check the DEP settings for almost any problem.
