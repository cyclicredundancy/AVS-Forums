/me downloads anyways<br />
<br />
dotland is cool (love the spherical dot effect!) but needs to react to the beat more<br />
elessdee gave me a seizure :rolleyes: and made my display skip around...<br />
speed looks kinda like something I did, but never published... it's neat.<br />
wavewarp would look REALLY awesome if the m.p.'s moved TOWARDS the screen, against the background. But that's a big drain on FPS.<br />
zebramind... could use some more effects (on-beat quick bright?)<br />
zoom... kinda cool, but could use some more contrast.<br />
<br />

		Very nice! Although I have seen some of the effects before, I really liked Dotland and Elesee (very intense). They're both very unique and original. You will definatly go very far if you continue to create. :)
