      <p class="post-content"><strong>vector visualisations</strong><br />
      does a such a thing exist or could it exist<br />
      <br />
      a visualition plugin that produces/use vector graphics...<br />
      <br />
      ie flash type, one colour per shape, type graphics that in vogue right now...?<br />
      <br />
      that would animate to the music but not be not be glowing pixels with blurs and trails but interesting solid animations,?</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS does not have real vector support, but you can still draw shapes and lines (and polygons, with triangle.ape) with Superscope.<br />
      <br />
      Plus, there are tons of presets that have a vectorized or celshaded look.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure others can chime in interesting examples. Check out my Tokyo Bullet preset in <a href="http://www.acko.net/final+whack" target="_blank">Final Whack</a> for the ultimate superscope experience ;).</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks all, t-lobo i had actually downloaded some of yours the other day... :)<br />

      wouldn't vector stuff not be less processor hungry?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Vectors still have to be rasterized. At heart, almost all custom coding in AVS is vector-based.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i see what ya mean unconed, vector based neh maths based.. but the look is different and does the benefits of using flash(mb size, processing need) in 2d not translate when talking about visulisations?<br />
      <br />
      anyway i found exactly what i was looking for now to find a free version... <a href="http://www.marmalademedia.com.au/flashamp/" target="_blank">http://www.marmalademedia.com.au/flashamp/</a> whats ya think of it, well it doesnt quite do it live but its a step in the right direction,</p>

      <p class="post-content">flash has some nice extras for vector-based stuff, like anti-aliasing and sub-pixel accuracy...<br />
      flash might be a nice thing but it's (afaik) definitely missing trans effects</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah a flash plugin would be nice except it'd be slower? would avs even be able to handle that kind of err mathematical + graphical processing?</p>

      <p class="post-content">there are no benefits to using 'vector' geometry. its no different to the geometry all ready available.<br />
      <br />
      and no none of the 'benefits' of flash translate to avs if you mean 'speed' benefits.<br />
      <br />
      technically they should be called deficits in this case... since nothing in flash could speed up avs afaik.</p>
