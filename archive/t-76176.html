      why do you (whoever) move the "Dynamic Movement Basics neded.."-,"is it possible to control SS by any determined pitch?"- and "Random Vars synchon in more SS"-Threads into the "AVS-Presets" Forum? they are not Preset-threads... there are only techinical questions for SS and DM.. the attached preset are only a consequence of the discusion and sometimes even essential...the "Random Vars synchon in more SS"-Threads has not even a attached preset. i'm very confused about this moves</p>
