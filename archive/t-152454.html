      Hello again. Here's the fourth instalment, released two days late because I've been too busy with concerts 'n' stuff (Linkin Park at Rod Laver Arena, w00t).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Okay, now I'm REALLY fucking pissed off!!! WA.com removed the pack because it's identified as a rip! And after I obtained explicit permission from each and every one of you! FUCK!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ask one of the reviewers or check the rip forum. If no rip was reported, it's probably a database error. A pack named 'remixes' would be quite obviously not a rip.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It probably was a database error. I am pretty sure that I reviewed your pack, and I most definitely didn't report it as a rip. Sorry about any inconviences it may have/ or will cause you. The databases really are needing to be fixed - it's getting out of hand.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no matching CID in the removal forum, so it must've been a screwup. I posted in the appeal thread, just in case.<br />
      <br />
      So is there any way to get around it?</p>

      Step 2. Use DA.com instead<br />

      <p class="post-content">zeven, no we didn't. what's that have to do with <u>ANYTHING</u>?? :p<br />
      <br />
      and i know this is off topic, but why is it that DA takes so fucking long to load shit? i haven't looked at their code, but i'm pretty sure that you can't do much to bloat your code to that level. and with the amount of images they use (no less than the average porn site), it's gotta be slow ass servers. which prompts me to ask: why the fuck are their servers so slow, and have been so slow for aeons?</p>

      <p class="post-content">DA3 is a lot faster than DA2, mainly because it's more distributed. But I think the core of the problem is XML. XML is just too bloated.</p>
