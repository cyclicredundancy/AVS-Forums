			<strong>Cannot get beat detection to work</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi, looked on the forums for 'beat detection' but couldn't spot anything too relevant...<br />
<br />
I've used Milkdrop off &amp; on and it seemed beat detection never seemed to work, i.e it didn't look like the visualisation reacted in any way to the music playing. I finally decided to try AVS, and same thing, so I've been trying to tweak settings (beat threshhold) and still seems to have no effect on the visuals.<br />
I downloaded half a dozen other visualisations and they don't seem to react in any way either to the music playing. Some of their docs say what effect the music will have, but I'm not seeing it.<br />
<br />
So is there something somewhere disabled in my winamp what supresses beat detection? (BTW, the oscilloscope in the main winamp window seems to operate just fine.)<br />
I'm using the latest version of winamp, XP-SP3, nvidia 8500GT TDH HDMI video card.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

		I just spotted in the AVS Editor settings menu the 'beat detection' screen. It says under the 'advanced status' panel that the current BPM is 'learning...' and confidence is 0% - I guess a pretty good indication that beat detection isn't working! Any ideas why this might be?<br />
I noticed beat detection in *cough* media player *cough* is working ok with their visualisations...

		you probably need to look at your output plugin settings (maybe also input plugin)or your general soundcard settings.

 Ok... I looked at these and could not see anything that appeared relevant to my problem. Which output/input settings exactly are you suggesting I check?

		you could also, in AVS, check <i>standard beat detection</i> instead of <i>advanced beat detection</i>. i use that one anyway since it's better for my music.

		i think to remember, that not all files produced the equal response for avs, but i take it you're playing common files like mp3, m4a or flac? i think the response for mod, sid or even audio cd wasn't so good. this might depend on the input plugins used, it could be outdated info or i'm just plain wrong.
