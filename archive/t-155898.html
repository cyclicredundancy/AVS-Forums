<div class="posttext">Hello All,<br />
 I'm working on a project here and as part of it I'd like to have AVS displayed on 8 TVs across the room via S-Video cables. I have a radeon 7500 64mb with S-Video out, an S-Video splitter and the cables, but I need to know what kind of power to throw at it.<br />
My Athlon 2400 doesn't seem to have the power to drive AVS at 1024x768 on this monitor, so I doubt the embedded solution I want to use, a Via C3 1Ghz cpu, will either. What kind of power would I need to run these things out to TV's? I'm not even sure of the TV's resolution to be honest.<br />
What'll happen is there'll be the HTPC-like interface on a 15&quot; LCD with the AVS outputted to a small 200x200pix window on the LCD and fullscreen to 8 TVs sparsed around the room. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1024x768 on a tv?!<br />
<br />
however, there were like a billion questions like this here, so try searching your answers in this very forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no no, 1024x768 on the monitor, and then whatever the full screen res is on the TVs. I know it's low, lower then 800x600, but can't recall what it is offhand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i can run avs smoothly between 480x360 and 640x480, in a few cases 800x600 might work aswell.. however, i guess you're using the overlay mode for tv-output. overlay is kinda smoothing up the image, so even low resolutions should do a good job.<br />
<br />
read this amateur description on resolutions (http://nickyguides.digital-digest.com/interlace.htm), otherwise try the good old wikipedia (http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you wouldnt want to run avs any higher than 480x360 in most cases.. Even on a beast, many good presets would be far too slow any higher res.<br />
<br />
As for the tv res', it doesnt matter at all if you are using overlay (which is the only way to do it really) because overlay just stretches or compacts the image and filters to smooth. You can almost double the output resolution with overlay without it being to lossy.<br />
<br />
Because avs is inherantly slow, you cant really use high res's. Just bare with a lossy, stretched image.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A cool, those resolutions DO work on a VIa 1Ghz CPU, so I shouldnt have a problem.<br />
<br />
It doesnt quite matter that it won't be crystal clear either, I don't think. It's a dark smokey club and mainly used for ambiance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">TV Res - depends on whether your using pal/ntsc.<br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter so much anyway - I video mix with 320X240 res clips video and they look brilliant. AVS isn't generally as sharp so I use 800X600 MINIMUM which is noticably better I think. I get fairly good FPS at that res - generally always over 16 fps for UBER complex shyte and 30+ for simpler compositions. <br />
<br />
I have problems outputting it in overlay mode as you will with radeon display cards and output to svideo as a secondary display device.<br />
<br />
These questions have been answered quite a bit before... a quick search will learn ya!</div></div><hr />
