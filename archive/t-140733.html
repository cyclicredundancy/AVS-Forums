I'm brand new here and love this little, straight to the point, MP3 player. Though everything works fine and fast as it is, I'm looking for something but don't know what I'm looking for. So, what is a, VISBOT???<br />
<br />
<br />
grr...damn idiot.  downrating something because he doesn't know what it is.<br />

and, of course, UnConeD has gotten tons of downratings and stupid comments for no reason.</div></div><hr />

Don't go thinkin I am some undeservingly rich f***ker either, I got all the parts for &quot;Epicenter&quot; (My Powerhouse system) for under $1500.00, I am not a complete computer guru snob either who thinks spending gobs more money on 15GB SCSI HD's makes much of a damn difference in speed either, those people are uber dorks with no lives and no girlfriends, if they do have a girlfriend, she is equally as dorky also and/or a completely insane B**ch that enslaves the man they are close to. I know the breed, of both that computer guru and the woman they MAY have. I am funny, thank you! Think of me as you wish, I do not care!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">At least there are no more serial downraters, one of the worst Plugins downraters was Janne Manne who 2 years ago gave every pack on 1st two pages 0 stars, and my 3rd pack that was on the first page with a 4.5 going to 5 slumped to a 4 never to rise again thanx to the shitty rating system (overall it was still around 4.5), and despite my pleads, not a single &quot;review&quot; by that person was removed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually I can't delete comments :D. I could ask a mod to ask an admin (or ask the admin myself) to delete the downgrading reviews, but don't expect anything, there are more important things these people do :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd July 2003, 16:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, us AVS reviewers can't delete any comments.  It takes an admin to do that.  They really should give us some power to delete comments like these.  That way it wouldn't take forever for it to get done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My fave was the first comment on my pack. It went something like <br />
<br />
&quot;Your pack is GAY. Ther is to much s**t going on in some. U lik balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
And no, those aren't typos. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That doesn't annoy me as much as internal flaws in the system. Check out the staff review of my Winamp 2 skin here (http://classic.winamp.com/skins/detail.jhtml;$sessionid$RKRRMSEOED5ETTN241HBCYY?componentId=134187). As well as the user review, for that matter.<br />

Is that like or lick? :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think they are referring to the video window, the ml, and the 'new' window for AVS.  I have 2.5, 2.5.1, and 2.6.1 on my system.  I don't use 2.6.x, I just was checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd July 2003, 18:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, there were some changes, after the 2.9 version, your skin isn't 2.9 compliant....   I didn't know you were a skinner, uNDefineD, it's good to see more people who are both skinners and avsers :D. I'm just working on a new one, you can probably find the thread in the wa2 skins forum. You can probably find a thread on how to update your skin(s) for 2.95 there too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dunno. I assumed it was lick. Like I said, the typos aren't mine.<br />
<br />
Decent skin by the way.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a skinner, really. It's just something I did in my spare time. :)<br />
<br />
m^2k--<br />
The base skin I downloaded from the NSDN contained data for the main window, playlist, EQ, minibrowser and AVS. I don't know anything about video or ML (whatever that is).</div></div><hr />
