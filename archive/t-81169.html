<div class="posttext">Hi peeples, <br />
I'm brand new and have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, I have a couple of questions, if you know the answer to any, help is appreciated...<br />
:igor: <br />
1. Where in om earth is the 'Settings' menu... I can't find it<br />
<br />
2. I downloaded a plug-in (whatever that is) and i can't get it to run... I think its suppose to let me set the time of when i want it to play music and junk, but i'm not sure since i can't get it to run.<br />
<br />
3. HOW DO YOU GET TEXT TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE VISUALIZATION THINGY&lt; A GUY AT SCHOOL MAKES IT SAY STUFF WHEN ITS PLAYING...HOW DOES HE DO IT?<br />
<br />
4. How do I get the visual to be set as a background on my computer... it that even possible? <br />
:weird: <br />
Remember if you answer the questions, answer in laymen's terms because I'm dumb...<br />
:( <br />
Thank you very much for the help<br />

<div class="posttext">How to edit AVS?<br />
<br />
1. First, go to visualization menu<br />
2. Select Advanced Visualization Studio<br />
3. Click start (That's how to start it)<br />
<br />
1. Double click the AVS window<br />
2. A new window should appear<br />
3. That's your edit window.<br />
        - Press the &quot;+&quot; button on the window to add stuffs<br />
        - The &quot;-&quot; button do the opposite<br />
        - If you press &quot;-&quot; when selecting &quot;main&quot;, all effects goes<br />
               out<br />
        - The &quot;x2&quot; button creates exact copy of the effect you <br />
               selected (does not work on &quot;main&quot;<br />
        - Hopefully, you know such thing as &quot;math&quot;<br />

And hopefully, this will help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Your incoherent rambling makes me think that you have no idea what AVS is :)<br />
<br />
Here's the big picture that might explain some things... you might already know this.<br />
<br />
Winamp was originally an MP3 player, but now it's an extensible audio player. It has a cool plug-in architecture which allows other people to write software that plugs into Winamp and expands it. There are several categories:<br />
<br />
- Input Plug-ins allow Winamp to read new kinds of audio files. Winamp already comes with input plugins for MP3, Wave, Audio CDs and MIDIs.<br />
<br />
- Output Plug-ins define how Winamp plays the music. Usually this is through your soundcard, but there are plug-ins that allow you to write the output to your harddisk instead (useful for converting MP3 to WAV) or something like that.<br />
<br />
- DSP Plug-ins modify the sound that Winamp plays. This ranges from simple Echo or Pitch control plug-ins to advanced professional audio filters.<br />
<br />
- Visualisation Plug-ins have one goal: display something cool that responds to the music Winamp plays. This ranges from simple bar spectrums to advanced 3D accelerated plug-ins.<br />
<br />
<br />
AVS (advanced visualisation studio, which this forum is about) is a Visualisation Plug-in. AVS itself is *also* extensible and modular: instead of showing pre-programmed visuals, it allows a user to combine built-in effects in virtually limitness ways to create so-called presets. You can download tons of presets from this site (in the category 'AVS Presets') or make your own (takes some practice to make something cool). On top of that, you can write your own effects (so-called 'APEs') if you know a programming language like C++.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, instead of answering all your questions (the one about the desktop visual is already answered by Jaheckelsafar) here's a good piece of advice: explore the programs you use. If you're just going to sit around going 'I don't know what that is', you'll never get anywhere. Take a look at Winamp's menus and click away... fire up AVS, double-click it and see what everything does. The chances of messing something *totally* up are small, and if you do, simply come here and ask for help :). You can find the 'settings' menu by just going over all the menus. A good tip though is that when a computer asks for confirmation and you don't know what, it's probably wise to click 'no' and see exactly what you're about to do.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way I wouldn't call yourself dumb. Is a 1st grader dumb? No, he simply hasn't learnt much yet. If you spend time with Winamp and AVS, you'll quickly learn how it all works. Everyone has to start from scratch :).<br />
<br />
(PS: Don't type in UPPERCASE LETTERS... it's considered to be shouting. If you want to emphasise something, use bold text or put *asterisks around it*)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you very much, I will take your comments into deep consideration. I still have a few questions left to be answered. for instance, I tried to follow the directions of the previous post about 'how to display a preset on your desktop'. Unfortunately, I keep getting stuck on the part once I get to 'display' under 'settings'. It says to check the box marks 'overlay...' but there is no box marked that, nor is it anywhere on that screen. So you see where I am having trouble. If you know of any tutoral or manual with pictures and not just words or very strong, easy to follow word, I would be much appreciative.I'm not an Un-intellectual person, I was merely frustrated at the time. Forgive my rudeness, I didn't realize that simple typing in uppercase offends people.<br />

<div class="posttext">I think that the best tutorial ever written for the whole desktop thing (that I've ever seen anyway). The box should be at the right of the window. Just poke around, you'll get it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you *really* can't find the overlay box, then it might simply not be there because you have an outdated AVS... download the latest Winamp, it should come with the latest AVS (v2.5).</div></div><hr />

Step 1 : D/l Winamp<br />
Step 2 : Choose Standard or Full. Lite version doesn't contain it.<br />
Step 3 : Install it.<br />
Step 4 : Overlay away!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Did you upgrade to it?<br />
<br />
Get the latest version. Make sure you get the one with AVS or you won't get the latest version of AVS.<br />
<br />
That's the only thing I can think of. It should come with 2.5 (unless they released a new version that I didn't get)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">what is up with you? I've read some of the replies you give people and you don't seem very nice... there have been a few comunication problems... I have downloaded the latest addition of winamp... I've downloaded three different versions... on each one there is no 'Overlay Mode' box... I don't want to upset anyone I just want to figure out how to work this... I have been devoting all my time to messing around with it so that I can better understand it... Im not looking for someone to just tell me everything but I just need a little help... I know that I don't know half the things that you know about this program so I understand that you have senoirity over me but you don't have to be this way... I'm a friendly person... I'm trying to learn this for a TV program I run at my high school... I'm new to this I'm sorry if I've upset you... I'm frustrated and having someone treat me like I'm a 'moron' doesn't help...<br />

Thanx for your time, I'll I'm asking for is a link...<br />

<div class="posttext">To be honest, if you haven't found it now, you really should spend more time getting comfortable with computers. We don't mind helping people, but when you offer clear responses that should be enough for 99% of the users and someone still doesn't get it, you get the impression that he/she is simply not trying hard enough.<br />
<br />
Now... take a look at these pictures. They should be more than enough.<br />
