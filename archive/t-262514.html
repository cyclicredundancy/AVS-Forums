			<strong>Visualnoobs Logo Contest</strong><br />
		
		

		Hello as you know i'm the president and webmaster for visualnoobs and well everyone keeps asking me when am i going to change the website and make it better.<br />
well first to change the sites image i need a logo and thats where all you avsers can help. I require about 20 people to enter and submit a max of 2 images and then i will pick 10 and then i'll pick 4 and so on and so on until i've got a winner. there will be no favorites and there is one exception. the logo does not have to be about avs, just the meaning of visualnoobs.<br />
<br />
Meaning of visualnoobs.<br />
We at visualnoobs will provide a working background for the avs noob. that will provide tuts,preset examples and pack revision and collection posting.<br />
<br />
thats about all there is.<br />
there is no due date. the timer will start when all 20 people are in.<br />
<br />
have fun.

		this contest sounds more like an excuse to get an logo, cause you can't make it yourself - no offense. at least provide something more, i never heard of or seen anything about VN. in such a case producing content should have priority, only that will convince people.

		There are some members and it has been mentioned on the forums before a few times. However, I still agree with yathosho that you should perhaps make some content first... I haven't noticed any visualnoobs packs anywhere. (not that I have been checking)<br />
<br />
Since I am totally antithetical to the very nature of a noob I will assume that my 3d model of VN projected onto a 3-sphere bouncing around the screen with rigid-body dynamics rendered with soft shadows, bloom, diffuse and specular lighting and fresnel reflectivity is disqualified?<br />
<br />
Oh well. At least I don't have to make the preset I just described...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Nanaki, you should fix your sig quote to have the original source. Everytime I see it it grinds my gears a little. Quoting quotes of quotes is pretty... well... it makes me use four q's in the same sentence, that should be enough. :p<br />

<br />
Read it, and respect the context of the quote too. Too many people take that quote the wrong way and interpret it as &quot;Mathematics is rubbish&quot;.
