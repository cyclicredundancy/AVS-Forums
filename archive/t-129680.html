<div class="posttext">Time for TFF3.0 remixes...attached are ninish (can't remember now :p )  You've got all the time in the world to do them...the intro I'm planning could take weeks, and I'm still working on a devart tribute preset, which could start consuming much of my time soon.  blahblahblah.....get to work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am proud of myself, because this is my first review! <br />
<br />
PSYCHO-SOMATIC ADDICT- Quite cool, except there are a lot of colours. The black and white flash is cool.(this one doesnt seem to be a snow ball)<br />
<br />
CHEESE CULTURES - Not really beat responsive, although I like this preset. Great work :up:<br />
 <br />
COOKING - Try hardcore with this one.<br />
<br />
DON'T YOU LOVE PARTICLES? - Wow! I love this. But this one is slow on my computer. you could have used texer with this one, but the amount of particles is quite large ( 2500 X 3 = ? :) )<br />
<br />
GANGSTA TRIPPIN - Now this one works quite good on my computer and is quite good looking too. Keep it up.<br />
<br />
CAN'T XOR DUST - Maybeit would have looked better if you had used XORed, maybe. But this one looks like um..well..I cant describe it, but I didnt like this one.<br />
<br />
QUASI-LUNAR LAWNSCAPE - I know this is a texered preset but what about the bitmap? and now it looks crap.<br />
<br />
STOP CLOWNING AROUND - The colour are n00b stylish and I dont like it.<br />
<br />
Overall, some of the presets are good, but you can improve. I would give 4</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">oh i see, i was wondering why there was an empty texer and hardly anything going on in cooking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A not so quick remix of cooking ( took me 2 hrs ).<br />
looks great, but needs some time to start.<br />
and looks great in high resolutions and pixel doubling off</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">FYI: I'm the editor here, and I'm going to be leaving it at 1 comment WITH that blank space (to put my disclaimer at the bottom), your name, and your comments (please write some up!) :) I'll also be optimizing anything I can (nothing that'd change the preset itself, mind) because I'm a freak about that sort of thing ;) (Am I using parantheses too much?)<br />
<br />
(That is, if nobody minds...)<br />

<div class="posttext">Atero you need to go out and find yourself another 300 pound 14 year old and share your &quot;appetites&quot; :p :D :up:<br />
<br />
Do what you want with my remix, just dont change the effect, i have no comments about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I never at any one point said that he was gay. What i actually said was find another overweight 14 year old. That could mean either sex, and then i said that the &quot;(.)(.)&quot; implied that he like's tits. Read posts properly before posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th March 2003, 00:30</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Yeah, but weren't you trying to say that he didn't like tits?  That's what I am gathering from your post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw...please don't take offense...but the only two i'm considering putting in the pack so far are the two cooking remixes...just thought i'd say it now so people aren't pissed when they don't see it when tff3 is released :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually these are really hard to remix in my opinion. Added two Mixes. One of Gangsta Trippin (you really get mad, listening to it an hour non stop) and Psycho-Somatic Addict. The second one is rather a spin off than an remix, cause I deleted that XOR thing ;)</div></div><hr />
