      Time for TFF3.0 remixes...attached are ninish (can't remember now :p ) You've got all the time in the world to do them...the intro I'm planning could take weeks, and I'm still working on a devart tribute preset, which could start consuming much of my time soon. blahblahblah.....get to work.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>My first review</strong><br />
      I am proud of myself, because this is my first review!<br />
      <br />
      <b>PSYCHO-SOMATIC ADDICT</b>- Quite cool, except there are a lot of colours. The black and white flash is cool.(this one doesnt seem to be a snow ball)<br />
      <br />
      <b>CHEESE CULTURES</b> - Not really beat responsive, although I like this preset. Great work :up:<br />
      <br />
      <b>COOKING</b> - Try hardcore with this one.<br />
      <br />
      <b>DON'T YOU LOVE PARTICLES?</b> - Wow! I love this. But this one is slow on my computer. you could have used texer with this one, but the amount of particles is quite large ( 2500 X 3 = ? :) )<br />
      <br />
      <b>GANGSTA TRIPPIN</b> - Now this one works quite good on my computer and is quite good looking too. Keep it up.<br />
      <br />
      <b>CAN'T XOR DUST</b> - Maybeit would have looked better if you had used XORed, maybe. But this one looks like um..well..I cant describe it, but I didnt like this one.<br />
      <br />
      <b>QUASI-LUNAR LAWNSCAPE</b> - I know this is a texered preset but what about the bitmap? and now it looks crap.<br />
      <br />
      <b>STOP CLOWNING AROUND</b> - The colour are n00b stylish and I dont like it.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, some of the presets are good, but you can improve. I would give <font color="crimson">4</font></p>

      Actually these are really hard to remix in my opinion. Added two Mixes. One of Gangsta Trippin (you really get mad, listening to it an hour non stop) and Psycho-Somatic Addict. The second one is rather a spin off than an remix, cause I deleted that XOR thing ;)</p>
