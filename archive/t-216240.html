      <p class="post-content">I have a similar problem.. AVS only shows a black screen on TV OUT mode.. I can't get it to show up there any way at all in fullscreen. Before someone goes and tells me that's the way it's supposed to be, I had AVS overlay working perfectly back in early 5.0.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm sorry for 'jumping to a conclusion'.<br />
      <br />
      let me explain how it happened.<br />
      <br />
      'When i use overlay in AVS and turn on tv overlay on TV...'<br />
      <br />
      i read this as 'i used avs in overlay mode, turned on and ensured the tv was correctly connected and set the hardware overlay was set to use the tv out and not the monitor.'<br />
      <br />
      is that an unreasonable assessment? if you missed the implication of overlay use then... well you need help.<br />
      <br />
      the rest of the sentence 'I see only green screenon TV but on monitor Works OK.'<br />
      <br />
      allows me to directly imply that the overlay has not been set to the tv as was originally stated. if it was then by how overlay works there would be no display on the monitor. regardless as to the state of the TV.<br />
      <br />
      whether the green screen results from no input is irrelevant and can be determined independently from AVS. and in fact unless the post writer has a sub 50 IQ they would test their TV out in general before trying to make it work in AVS and the post would be 'my TV out doesn't work'<br />
      <br />
      after the logic and fact comes the bit of experience (which really means nothing) that says this is a common problem people run into when they use overlay.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The one time (one time) I viewed AVS on TV was at my friends and I just dragged the avs window to the TV side and just activated fullscreen, worked like a charm :igor:<br />

      <p class="post-content">OK I've been up all night working, so my English mite suk.<br />
      <br />
      I'm guessing what you are trying to do is have the AVS out put full screen on one monitor, and have the main monitor for the desktop (usable for applications). I'm also assuming when you say you want to use 'overlay', you want the secondary monitor to display the overlay as in Theater Mode. As you found out it does not work for a lot of people, but it has been stated if extend your desktop to the second monitor your AVS window can be visible on that in a mock theater mode.<br />
      <br />
      --Some helpful hints to make it work less painful--<br />
      <br />
      1) Try set the second monitor to the lowest resolution possible for best performance. If WinXP does not provide the choice of 640x480 this can be done in the advance options if you are using an ATI card. Under the Display Properties 'Setting' tab, select the second monitor and click 'Advance', then the 'Adapter' tab, and next hit the 'List All Modes' button. In this dialog box is you can force the resolution to any mode your video card can handle.<br />
      <br />
      2)To have the AVS window fill the second screen with no hint of the surrounding frame, adjust the size of the window while it's still visible on the first monitor making several pixels larger then the intended screen. After the window is at the correct size drag it in to place, this will be lot easier then trying to resize the AVS out put window while it resides on the smaller second screen. If you are VJing you may want to pay attention that the center of the display area is lined up to the center of the monitor.<br />
      <br />
      3) You can also set the AVS's window size and position VA winamp INI file. With a simple script you can have it so Winamp will start with AVS open and in the right place.<br />
      <br />
      4) If the AVS window becomes lost or invisible, remember you can adjust size and position of that window with Winamp INI file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure if this is your issue, but on win2k/winxp (maybe 9x/me) when you use multiple monitors and extend your desktop to another monitor, you have a primary and secondary monitor. All full screen windows default to your primary monitor... which will be your monitor... not your TV... though this may impede some of your other work, it should solve your problem.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Just a comment</strong><br />
      Not really asking for help as I have resigned to not have AVS to TV out again.<br />
      <br />
      I have GF4mx440/XPhome OS, I know the card has nothing to do with AVS, but I say this because I have never been able to have dual monitor support (same time) Only toggle from Monitor to TV, so throwing screens etc is of no use.<br />
      <br />
      That being said, I have searched the forums many times and tried various configurations to no avial. I have not been able to run AVS to TV out since version 3x (It worked fine with this version). However Video streams from Winamp and all other Software I use (except powerdvd) seems to work flawless.<br />
      <br />
      Im not a tech nut, just my 2cents. Some things just dont work out. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another interesting and curious bug i've seen happen now that i'm using my new computer (xp 64 bit with an ATI x800) is that overlay mode doesn't properly refresh. To fix this on an ati card go to the monitor that's having the issue (1 or 2, or tv) by right clicking the desktop, click properties, settings tab, (making sure you have the right monitor selected, click advanced, then click the overlay tab. Hit the default button on that and it should fix the blank screen issue. For gforce cards not entirely sure, but i think that there is an overlay setting somewhere in the list that has settings for brightness and the like. and i believe that the default button will also work there<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well this is a common problem with Radeons and especially if you have installed that Controll Center extra thing that messes the whole thing totally and takes up all of your resourses. Anyway check the pal and overlay settings, mainly look how they are for your monitor with the second monitor /tv/ off. AVS should work fine, then turn on the second monitor and look at the settings, it us very /surely/ possible that they have changed. Now apply the setting that was previously of the primary tv to the secondary, that should work, cos they change automatically. Hope i haven't confused you, i will make some screenshots tonight to show yop what i mean. But jheriko is right - the card overlay settings mess stuff bad /try running a movie - you should get the same result as from the avs window/.</p>
