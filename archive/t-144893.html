<br />
<div class="posttext">After a great and succesfull tournament we decided to do another one :). <br />
<br />
It'll be based on the same idea as the last one. For the people who didn't join then: You start with a given number of players, and every round a few will have to go out (knockout system). Presets will be rated on how they look, how original they are, and how much they have to do with the name (each round you are given a name, an example from last round: glow in the dark). This will not be a race for who uses his best technical skills, which wouldn't be fair for the less technical AVS'ers. <br />
<br />
This means everyone can join, the higher leveled ones, but also the n00bies and newbies.<br />
<br />
For as far I know: Raz will join, and so will Siddhartha_one. Ishan_rocky volunteered to be judge again. I agree on that if the others do as well, because he did a great job last round.<br />
<br />
So who's in? Everyone can join, it's just for fun, you don't have to be a math wizard! <br />
<br />
As for the start date, this is still unknown. It depends on how many will join, and when people say they can start making their presets.<br />
<br />
So let's go for it again :), it'll be great,<br />
<br />
Deamon<br />

<div class="posttext">sure does, but the more, the better :). Keeps it more exciting. Oh, and judges, start simple eh ;) don't make up extremely hard things to do in the beginning. Not very polite for the newer people around here who might join. Unless you want to differ the man from the boys.... *evil grin*<br />

<div class="posttext">Ok we'll wait for Tuggummi before discussing starting times at least. I can't inform people at DevArt, I'm not a member over there. Perhaps somebody else can do so? Tournament will be on the winamp forums still, I hope they don't bother. Though the idea is good, it might attract quite some other players if they like the idea.<br />

<div class="posttext">A quartic DM is a DM that would allow some really cool looking surfaces, such as the torus.  Jheriko and UnConeD have tried doing it, but can't seem to get it to work right(jheriko can't anyways).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Quartic DMs are raytracing DMs that can solve problems in form of x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuarticEquation.html for in-depth... the maths behind it is complex, which is why most of us are leaving the work to the two of them :)<br />
<br />
Quartic surfaces include Chmutov Surface (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChmutovSurface.html), Goursat's Surface (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoursatsSurface.html), Torus (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoursatsSurface.html), and a shitload more.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, why not, i'm in :D<br />
<br />
Btw, we had a couple of damn good ideas what could be done better in the judging system (see last tournament thread) so please remember them BEFORE we start this one.<br />
<br />
I think it was like this:<br />
<br />
We need one coordinator who gets the presets by mail.<br />
After a round is done, presets are randomly renamed and send here, then every contestant can judge them (except his own preset).<br />
<br />
The votes are send to the coordinator again and he publishes the result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That indeed would be fairer, though it complicates things a lot. I like the general idea of the coordinator, though I don't like the idea of having to mail all the presets instead of posting them here. Also I can't see other peoples work (though that's fairer too ;)). We didn't have any problems with judging last round, so why change it? Ah well, I guess it's up to the judges. The idea is good :).<br />
<br />
Glad to have you in, Magic.X, and thanks for the judging support. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th August 2003, 11:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The basic things i dont like about the other system is that you can do only one thing, judge or create. Both would'nt be only fairer, it would give all Members the possibility to evaluate the other presets which i would prefere.<br />
<br />
And the mailing thing is just fine. If the first posted Preset is some SupertechyUnConeDlikeawesomelooking stuff, the reaction among newbies is &quot;OMG, i could never do something this good&quot; which is fairly disappointing right at the start.<br />
<br />
Its just a suggestion. Take it or leave it, i won't mind. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th August 2003, 11:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">having 3 judges is fair enough. If we would start a system which means everyone rates everybody's preset, that would go way too slow. Mostly because of people who aren't regulars or have dial-up connections and cannot therefor check everytime to rate every preset. I've changed my mind about the mailing thingie, I guess it's do-able just fine :). And it's up to the judges to make some good topics about what we should do. I'm sure they'll start of easy for the newbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th August 2003, 11:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't really think they'd launch a topic like raytracing and if they did, i'd make up SSC ray and a SSC Crosshair that &quot;traces&quot; along the ray :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th August 2003, 12:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">We aren't going to be choosing any topics where you have to have any sort of advanced knowledge.  All of our topics will be more or less &quot;themes&quot; that you build your presets around.<br />
<br />
As for judging, I see nothing wrong with what we did last time.  Having everyone judge would make it end up taking a really long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree that there is no real point in such a convoluted judging system... it will just slow things down, even though it is fairer and generally better.<br />
<br />
I wish I never made that post... it seems to have caused general disarray.. it was meant to be a joke. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">dunno, we're waiting for him to reply. Till that time signups are open to every one. After that I think we can get started :D.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suggest 2 instead of 5 or so people get kicked out every round. Otherwise the round will go to fast. Just an idea, it's of course up to the judges. I prefer 2 each round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">We do that though, and we'll have like 7 rounds.  That's a lot of rounds.  If that's what everyone wants then let's do that.  Opinions anyone?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th August 2003, 06:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmmm. Why do we kick anyone? We could sum up the points from every round in the end instead, so it will last as long peopel like! Besides this is much fairer, because noone gets kicked because he got a topic he couldnt be creative enough with.<br />
<br />
(This has been proposed before and the majority agreed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th August 2003, 07:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sounds good. It'll be more fun for the people who otherwise be kicked out in the earlier rounds as well. If we have a knockout system, I think  2 or 3 people should be eliminated each round, though I generally like the idea of Magic.X a lot more. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Previous one was indeed knockout, and that worked just fine, but this is much more fun, since it lasts longer, and it's fairer to people who just happen to suck at one theme. You even say it in your signature, Ishan ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">As much as possible if it's up to me ;). I guess it isn't a good idea to just get started and then see how long we want to go on? We can always decide later when we want to stop...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">thats fine with me. I guess i just mixed up this tournament with the previous one:p<br />
so when do we start? i guess we have the first topic ready(anubis?) so we an start.and what about doggy dog? is he judging too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th August 2003, 17:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, we got a topic ready.  Doggy Dog will probably be judging(if not this round then the next one) - he should be back before the first deadline.  I say we do 5 rounds.  5 rounds and 15 contestants makes 60 presets - A nice number for a large pack.<br />
<br />
Each of the three(two?) judges rates each preset out of 10 points based on:<br />
1. ability to represent topic<br />
2. overall appearance of preset<br />
3. Um, there is no three that I can think of.<br />
That means a possible total of 3*10*5, or 150 possible points at the end of five rounds.  Top three contestants get recognition.  It would be nice if they could have a custom title for a month like MOTM winners have(would that be doable mods?).  If not, then they just get the nice feeling that they are better than everyone else.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th August 2003, 17:31</div></div>

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'll post the topic soon.  First a few more details to work out:<br />
<br />
1.  How long should the time be to make the preset?  1 week sound good?<br />
2.  Since the point total is cumulative, can people join in after the first round and still be put in the competition?  They'll be at a disadvantage of having missed rounds, and it will allow people who happened to not know that we were doing it to still be able to participate.<br />
3.  Once again, there is no three.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th August 2003, 04:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I guess it doesnt matter if you miss rounds now then.<br />
A week sounds like easy enough time, though people seemed to not get it in time last time.. ie me..<br />
oh well.. people miss out, its their own silly fault..<br />
...<br />
<br />
Oh, usually the third thing to look for would be the technicalness of it, not neccessarily groovy insano code, but just the techniques they have used to get the effects. .,.. but oyu might not want to judge on that in this thing.. seeing as there are many youngens here.<br />
<br />

I sent a PM to ishan discussing the matter.  Once us judges decide what we're going to do, one of us will let you all know.  Until then, you can still make your presets(the topic won't change).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">is someone actually going to be come to this page to determine if we got our preset in at, for example 11:58:59?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The time of posting is labelled on each post. You posted that at 3:05 AM.. I hope at least that everyone gets the time in GMT on the forums otherwise it will screw everything up + I live in the GMT time zone.. not too far from Greenwich either... so it saves me hassle. :)<br />
<br />
Atero: I was more hinting at people waiting for everyone else to post so they can examine the competition and strive to make their preset even better... its not exactly cheating but it would be really annoying because it would slow things down, if two (or more) people did that and ended up posting on the last day at practically the last minute, if everyone actually had their presets ready a few days earlier. Rushing is bad... I know I posted my preset pretty quickly, but it was one of those mad inspiration things rather than a rush.. I couldn't stop myself from AVSing so quickly!</div></div><hr />

I would like to add one small note to my tournament entry &quot;the dream&quot;. I've just watched it on my new computer and it's way faster than it's meant to be. To the judges, it's meant to run with about 6-7 FPS. More than this will speed up the preset a lot, which will still look pretty nice, but not very dreamy. I hope you can take this in consideration while rating the preset,<br />
<br />
Thank you :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">LOL!<br />
<br />
This is a winrar file. Its like zip, but another compression format.<br />
<br />
Do the following:<br />
<br />
-get WinRar (or WinAce)<br />
-unpack the preset<br />
-repack as a zip file<br />
<br />
And keep in mind that changing file extensions wont change their type or content.</div></div><hr />

Btw, Ishan the Topic is'nt too bad, because it gives you enough creative freedom to do anything you like. It's just a bit harder to come up with an idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's just as Raz said. If you've a clear descritpion of what is expected, you can start up work nearly immediatly - but the results would the more look alike, the more the description is close to the point.<br />
<br />
So all you gotta do is come up with a good idea that you like.<br />
<br />
Is it really this hard? You can dream about everything imaginable.<br />
<br />
Examples: (Drugs, Sex, Flying, Nightmares, ...)<br />
<br />
It's not the point to make everything look dreamy (what is dreamy anyway? sometimes its sharp, sometimes blurred) but to give the viewer the intention that this is a dream. (Comments may help here)<br />
<br />
Hey, even a cube DM with a photo of your gf on the sides would do, coz you dream of her every night. :D<br />
<br />
So again: get your ass moving, be creative! There are still 2 days left.</div></div><hr />

that is, unless we get a lot of stuff really fast.<br />

<div class="posttext">everyone goes to round 2 ;), we're counting total score of a given number of rounds this time. I think we can count on some late-minute presets, some people tend to do it a lot. At least... I hope so :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">We are setting the length of the tournament at a fixed number of rounds(5, I believe).  People can skip out on rounds, join in after the first round, or quit before the end.  The winner is whoever has the highest cumulative total at the end of all of the rounds.</div></div><hr />

The colours are great too... personally I'd say this is the best submission so far. :)<br />

<div class="posttext">No, we gotta judge first(well, we did last tournament, anyways).  I'll talk to ishan though, and see if we can get it out any earlier.  Probably won't get it out at 12, but it's almost possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 23:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">okay, this obviously isn't clear, since me and j got in an argument over it (fortunately jaak stepped in and started being a total ass, which fixed everything) - are people getting dropped this round or not?  i say they should, i know i'm not participating in it if it isn't going to be a knockout tournament like it was supposed to be...personally i think if you missed the first round, tough cookies.  but that's just me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 23:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">We decided by a general vote that this wasn't going to be a knockout tournament.  People didn't seem to like the knockout tournament - if the first topic wasn't a good topic for them and they made a crap preset, then they could be dropped even if they would have been capable of beating the pants off people in the next rounds.  This way, people who may not like the certain theme(you, for instance) still are in good contention, because other people probably won't like the next one.  Letting people in after the first round is fine too, because they will have the disadvantage of having not gotten any points for the first round.  The winner(s) of the tournament are not going to be selected on average score, but their cumulative score.  People who miss out on this round will be behind by a maximum of 30points(if Doggy_Dog is judging as well).  That's a severe hinderance to them, but if they do really really well in the next rounds then they could catch up.  This method is also better to use in a tournament of this size.  In the last tournament, despite its smaller size, we had to hold off on the next round to wait for people on vacation.  In this competition it allows for people to leave without us having to wait for them - they get penalized some(although we will still try to get them into the round if it isn't a big difficulty - we did wait for you), but it could become insane if we didn't.  Also, with 2 weeks for each round, they would have to be on a LONG trip to not be able to submit anything.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to continue in the tournament, then don't.  It doesn't make sense to me, but do whatever you want to do.  We would like to keep you in it, but we can't change any major rules that we set up before unless everyone agrees.</div></div><hr />

and yea anubis now that you put it that way i see how it'd work...the reason i wanted it to be a knockout tournament is cos i wouldn't last 'till the last round, and school starts on tuesday (and i'm taking some heavy ass classes).  so i might drop out of the tournament anyway...<br />

btw i hate this topic too, it's as lucid as the last one (:p), but i already have a preset that fits it perfectly...does it count? ;)</div></div><hr />

Robotisgod deserved that high score.. I only just now looked at the preset and it is visually sweet and technically competent... the only problems I have with it are the dm glitches that pop up every now and again and the lack of aspect ratio correction... y=y*w/h; at the beginning will fix this.. I can't see what causes the random glitches tho, great effort!</div></div><hr />
