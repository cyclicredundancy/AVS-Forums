      This is very annoying. Through AVS I want to load a preset. For every one I go on 'Error loading preset'.<br />
      <br />
      I know Windows Me has Millions and Millions of problems, but I do share it (i.e. Password needs to be entered to logon). Something similar happens with Microsoft Office. I can't load anything unless it's on a certain 'side'.<br />
      <br />
      Is it just another Install I need? If so, will I have to install it on every part of Windows Me?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">windows Me should be called Windows TE (third edition)<br />
      anyways what version of winamp do you have?<br />
      and also if you need to install a later version of winamp I dont think that there would be a shortcut problem (as long as you install the new winamp in the old folder [make sure you backup your skins andplugins folders first])<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's not an ME thing, It's what I got on my laptop, and my laptop is where I develop my presets. ('cause it's easy to hook up to a tv :) ) It might be a user issue if you don't have permission to access the AVS dir. Try logging on as admin. Perhaps you're missing an ape? It could be that you copy of AVS is just messed and you'll have to download a new one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is a User thing. I found out MS Office 2000 Does it too. I am the 'administrator' on my system. MS Office works fine (Except Word), but don't work on other login names. If I stop all users (i.e. Loads up without putting anything in), MS Office will cease to work, I tried it, but I had to resort to Sytem Restore. I use Winamp 2.80, with a load of Plugins.<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way to get around this? Even if It means tinkering with the Registry?<br />
      <br />
      I love making AVS Presets, but I can't now!! Help!!!!!!</p>

      <br />
      I do have this Norton Move accessory that moves a program and tells the registry that it has moved, updsating infs and ini files and everything. Should I use that, or is more help on the way?:cry:</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can probably install right over the version you have, but to to things the proper way you should uninstall 2.80 first. Backup your plugins (at least AVS) dir.</p>
