      <p class="post-content"><strong>My Picture Folder Plug-in Vis</strong><br />
      is there a plugin for winamp, that i can set on my picture folder, to show my pictures in the visualization window, that goes to the music or makes cool transitions from one to the other?<br />
      <br />
      is there anything that can do that?<br />
      <br />
      thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well in the context of AVS... no not really. You would have to make a preset that displayed a series of pictures and transitioned between them in some cool way. That in essence is fairly simple but the pictures displayed would be fixed, and because of the nature of picture rendering it would be fairly slow.<br />
      <br />
      You could compile the pictures into an avi, that would render much quicker... but somehow I dont think your interested in going to this much trouble. I suggest you search elsewhere for a dedicated plugin.</p>
