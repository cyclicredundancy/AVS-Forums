SameFam, perhaps the ape isn't in your avs directory. That's the only thing I can think of. Open up the folder and if you see it in there, then perhaps the file is just corrupted and may need to be reinstalled.

		IrisAPE should contain a .ape file (prolly iris.ape or irislight.ape or something)<br />
that .ape file must be in winamp\plugins\avs<br />
<br />
and no, missing avs components do have <b><u><i>NOTHING</i></u></b> to do with your gfx card or something. in general, avs has not much to do with your gfx card... except for displaying the final (2D) picture on your screen

		No that have no effect.<br />
To me it look like the AVS finds the .Ape-file, but don't understands the meaning of the IrisApe.Ape<br />
because instead of saying( in the avs editor ) &quot; render APE/IrisApe &quot; it's says &quot; unknown render object &quot; and then in the objectwindow it says: &quot;Ape:Irisape: 0.1 Config size 32 &quot;<br />
The 109  presets that followed in the zipfile is installed and recogised, and the Irisape.ape file is in the avs directory.<br />
I have updated directx to 9.0b but i don't know if there is any adjustment required..<br />
Have shecked the sy-fi web.site but can't find any clues there for this isue.<br />
This is i suspect a more difficult problem than an installasion-fault.

		If the file is in the /winamp/AVS/ directory (not a subdirectory!), then AVS should automatically recognize the .APE after restarting AVS.<br />
<br />
AVS does not use DirectX in any way so that's not the problem either.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, then you could concider re-installing winamp..

		Ha, it seems as if that's all most always the answer. I've had to do it at least 20 times since I first got it five years ago. Or maybe it's just bad luck...

		Have tried to uninstal and then reinstal winamp and the Irisape. Yes. in the Winamp\plugins\avs dir.<br />
but.... IT STILL DON'T WORK.. ( Used the Winamp 5.08 version by the way ) Winamp recognise the FyrewurX.ape and it's plased in the same dir.<br />
It's no way it is a insallation-fault.<br />
i give up....<br />
Good night folk's <br />
Thank's by the way for many tips!!!!<br />
:)<br />
From the cold north of Norway.. SameFan

		New day, and still not giving up....<br />
he-he..<br />
Have installed Sy-fi's iJen.ape and this ape has a &quot;bug-report&quot; built in. The camera feed is stil not detected, but it the iJen.ape is present in the AVS editor.<br />
Bug-report window displays :  <br />
err not found!<br />
MEDION (7134) WDM Video Capture used instead.<br />
* Camera Report: <br />
Setting up ...<br />
All Ok.<br />
OUT[Init()]<br />
* End Report.<br />
<br />
This is a multi media pc and i suspect an IRQ connflict or just simply that the graphic-card is &quot;tied-up&quot; whith other connections...<br />
This will also efect IrisApe in the same way i think.<br />
Any replies to that? :rolleyes:

		I don't think the people who made irisape are around anymore. In any case, I never got it to work with my cam either. I guess you're on your own.

		We are still around.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly we dont have much time to check the forums etc and missed the posting... sorry...<br />
<br />
Ok, from reading this convo you have a cam problem.<br />
<br />
From your error report it looks like IrisAPE is trying to use your video card video capture device instead of your webcam.<br />
<br />
What webcam are you using?<br />
<br />
