      Zevensoft Media Network in conjuction Zevensoft Interactive present the:<br />
      <font size="4">Sonic 2 Contest</font><br />
      <br />
      What you have to do, is design a "level" for sonic to run through. How you do this, is by making a 'Vector Equation'. Example:<br />
      <br />
      R(t) = t<b>x</b> + sin(t*pi*10)<b>y</b><br />
      Will make a sine wave level for sonic to run/jump/roll through.<br />
      <br />
      The basic way it works, is it specifies where the ground is at time 't', which means you can make it loop if you want, however you'll have to provide a derivative for rotating sonic in that case.<br />
      <br />
      The best 3 will be included into the Sonic 2 preset, which will be released 2 weeks from now. Contest closes in 1 week.</p>

      Well i doubt i could do much out of it anyway. Sorry to waste your time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'd do it if I had the time :/<br />
      when I end up with some I'll try it out - then can I use it for the (never ending quest of) tff4? :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">you mean parametric? thats what that type of equation is called... and you can do beziers with it, so if you want a really cool static level you could make a huge 5000 control point bezier or something.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: I'll cook something up anyway. But I might not get round to it.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT2: Why do you need a derivative to rotate sonic? why not calculate it roughly from the previous position and the current position. There are better ways to approximate implict derivatives but this is easy and works really well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I suppose, I could just use atan2 to calculate the angle, but the main purpose of the dy/dx was for velocity reasons.</p>

      <p class="post-content">by 'velocity reasons' i assume you mean that sonic will slow down (or actually remain the same speed) when going up and down hills...er..... i mean he wont just go at a static speed along the x axis.. er... his speed will be affected by hills :S bleh.. i cant describe... i wish i had the math-vocab of a true avser. :(<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      anyways.. why do i get the feeling that this 'contest' is just a lame excuse for you not to make your own terrain :D<br />
      <br />
      .. hmm ive messed around abit.. i cant find a good way of creating true flats and slants, only curvs.... any suggests anyone?<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      btw, no need for atan2-age, looksee unicycle thing: angle=(pos-oldpos)*pi or somthing ther'bouts<br />
      <br />
      btw2, you guys seen the new edit post scheme?.. you can now delete post and even threads!!! w00t!<br />

      <p class="post-content">sidd: R(t)= atx + bty should be a straight line for different values of a and b.<br />
      <br />
      zeven: can't you use (dy/dt)รท(dx/dt) = dy/dx and calculate dy/dt and dx/dt by simply dividing the difference in x or y per frame by whatever you increment t by every frame? Just an idea, I'm at work so I can't test it out. Though i think its not good enough for what you want to do with it.</p>
