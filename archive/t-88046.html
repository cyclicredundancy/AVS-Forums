<div class="posttext">I'm tyring to get video mirroring working because I have a show comming up in a week where I will be doing AVS projected onto a large screen. The way this used to be for me, as soon as I had AVS using overlay, it would automatically go to the secondary display. Now when AVS is overlaying I'm still looking at my desktop on the other screen. To get it to mirror properly I have to go into all those properties and click secndary display again, even though it's already selected (or some other setting that, just to wake the thing up and get it going). Ok, so now it's mirroring the overlaying thing on the secondary display. now I minimize winamp, oh look, theres my desktop with AVS on it again. Or I change the size of the AVS window, hey look, it's my desktop again. <br />
<br />
What is supposed to happen is that it should automatically be mirroring anything using overlay. AVS is using overlay. This is happening with just AVS (TV tuner program works fine) I tried an older driver but I don't tihnk it helped (I didn't notice anything different infact) <br />
<br />
Anyone had this problem? Any solutions?<br />
<br />
In the attached image, AVS is running, the secondary display is showing my desktop and everything on it.  When I click secondary again, secondary display is only showing AVS, the way I want it to be.  or I can choose a different aspect ratio and it shows AVS again.</div></div><hr />
