      <p class="post-content"><strong>New preset, opinions please</strong><br />
      I've posted some pretty cheesy presets in the past but this one is a little better. For a while now I've been trying to teach myself enough about AVS to make myself a wormhole preset but haven't really been able to get it right. This is my latest attempt and it actually didn't come out too bad in my opinion. I'd like to hear from you guys though, maybe you can suggest something to make it look a little better. What I've been having the most trouble with is getting the wormhole to randomly bend (or turn) without making it hard to see the tunnel shape. I got the rotation, colors, and the speed but I'd like it to be a little more active. I'm imagining this preset only with the ability to take quick turns on beat. I think that would help prevent it from becoming boring.</p>
