      <p class="post-content"><strong>cube-E question</strong><br />
      my Code for a cube is like this (and im not interested in the "quicker" ways... of doing anything ... just want to know... how can i make the cube... no rotation etc... (do i need the rotation?) well here it is:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br /><font color="red">init:</font> n=5;<br /><font color="green">frame:</font>drawmode=1;<br />linesize=2;<br />rot=1;<br /><font color="blue">point:</font>point=(point+1)%4;<br />x1=-equal(point,0)+equal(point,1)+equal(point,2)-equal(point,3);<br />y1=equal(point,0)+equal(point,1)-equal(point,2)-equal(point,3);<br /><br />x1=x1*0.2;<br />y1=y1*0.2;<br /><br />x=x1*cos(rot)-y1*sin(rot);<br />y=x1*sin(rot)+y1*cos(rot);<br />x = x1+0.2; y = y1+0.2; z = -0.2; //plane 1<br />x2 = x2-0.2; y2=y2-0.2; z= 0.2 //plane2<br />//plane 3<br /></code>
</pre>now why cant i make a cube? <font color="red">NOTE:</font>i have another "matrix" thingo you make in the pak-9's tutorial i was going to put a cube above in this...

      <p class="post-content">:cool:<br />
      first, i tell you some definitions. a cube is a 3 dimensional object that consists of much more points. Do you know what I am talking about, man? first, define n for this method. thats the most important. then you say you are doing no rotation.<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />x=x1*cos(rot)-y1*sin(rot);<br />y=x1*sin(rot)+y1*cos(rot);<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      this is rotation, just because you have "rot" variable assigned to 1, you will never see this guy rotating. but thats okay since you didn't need that did you?<br />
      <br />
      Moving on with the next lines of crap. cause that is it. if you want to make a cube, simply assign points like you did with the square. you gonna need n=(amount of lines in a cube)+1, because the starting point and ending point of the drawing is the same. do a point-per point assignment to x1,y1, and also z1.<br />
      <br />
      and in the end, to merge the variables back into 2D:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />z2=1/(1+z1*0.5);<br />x=x1*z2;<br />y=y1*z2;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      this code has no optimizations, no aspect ratios corrected, as your wish was. learn from it.

      </blockquote>no hboy, you need 16 points iirc if you want to draw it with one line. Because you have to draw some points over to have continious line.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, as i have already sayd first try to make a cube out of 6 squares (6 superscopes), simply sync the movement and rotation of scopes, and you have a wireframe cube. thats the easiest and most logical way imo (im not saying its efficient or fast)

      <p class="post-content">you know that a cube consists of 6 sides, each can be considered as squares. soo...you need 6 squares! one for every side of the cube. place them as you would place the sides of the cube, and then you get your cube, I promise :)</p>

      </blockquote>i totally agree with this. a cube is really a basic shape, either with point-to-point coding in one scope or with 6 scopes synchronized. if you can't do this, stay with the less-code side of AVS. you know, many people started that way, no 3D and superscopes, still, they were and are amazing artists. speaking about for example horse-fly, yathosho, tuggummi didn't know 3D also in the first few packs.

      About the cube, you don't need to go about and do all that stuff with planes like that, you just take a cube and use dots to draw a line all around it.</p>

      What the heck is this supposed to do? The only variables that matter to a superscope are "x" and "y" as far as geometry goes. You need to output the points of your cube in order as "i" goes from 0 to 1.<br />

      </blockquote>constant is a type of variable. there are mainly two types: constant (their values are added once and then left that way) variables and dynamic (their value is changed over time)variables.<br />
      <br />
      guess of which kind are these then ;) if you assign points to it like the way sidd did it, it is a constant variable because it is not dynamically changed. but if you would do it dynamically it would be a dynamic variable. i wont explain how you do it dynamically.

      <p class="post-content">actually, there are no "constant variables", because that'd be a contradiction ;)<br />
      <br />
      constants are:<br />
      $pi, $e and so on<br />
      numbers like 1.2345<br />
      and that's about it<br />
      <br />
      variables are:<br />
      things like a, d, u, foo, moo,<br />
      <br />
      some variables are pre-set by the component you write your code into (such as red, green, blue, b, i and v for SuperScope)<br />
      others are read by the component and evaluated for rendering (like n, red, green, blue, x, y and skip for SuperScope)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You don't understand how my code works.<br />
      <br />
      Ask about the bits you don't understand first, <i>then</i> move on to more complicated things.<br />
      <br />
      To answer your first question, tempX and tempY are variables that are created the first time avs executes the per point code.<br />
      <br />
      They are user defined, which means that they have no special meaning in avs. They are just a place created especially for this scope to store values which will be used later.<br />
      <br />
      You could rename them to anything else, like x1 and y1, and it would do exactly the same thing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">certainly! That would be the only logical explanation. How else could it be that someone asks for help and -instead of doing as he is told- always knows it better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">think in your head, not on the forum, please :)<br />
      and please, learn step by step, do not try to learn the more complex things before learning the basics.<br />
      <br />
      none of us did 3D presets in the first place. all of us had to learn how to code first</p>
