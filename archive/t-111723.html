Xion, try paying more attention to comments the next time. If you don't read what others have to say, others won't be interested in what you have to say. Besides, I think El-vis would be the last person on earth to 'rip' something without credits :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nowhere I said that there was a rip.  I was just curious if there was a similarity in the DM's.  Yes, I know that there can be written codes but there may be differences that makes them look similar and may be different.  I did look at the credits but it may have been off the screen.  :(<br />
<br />
I am sorry if I made any confusion.</div></div><hr />

Translated into something a little easier for you to understand if you didn't get my subtle (like a brick through a window) point:<br />
<br />
READ THIS properly and don't just reply without doing so.<br />
<br />
UnConeD used some quotation marks around the word rip to show that the word isn't exactly appropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully that actually got your attention (which it probably also lost after the fourth word read).</div></div><hr />
