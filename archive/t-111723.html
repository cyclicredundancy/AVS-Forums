      Xion, try paying more attention to comments the next time. If you don't read what others have to say, others won't be interested in what you have to say. Besides, I think El-vis would be the last person on earth to 'rip' something without credits :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">nowhere I said that there was a rip. I was just curious if there was a similarity in the DM's. Yes, I know that there can be written codes but there may be differences that makes them look similar and may be different. I did look at the credits but it may have been off the screen. :(<br />
      <br />
      I am sorry if I made any confusion.</p>

      UnConeD used some quotation marks around the word rip to show that the word isn't exactly appropriate.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Hopefully that actually got your attention (which it probably also lost after the fourth word read).
