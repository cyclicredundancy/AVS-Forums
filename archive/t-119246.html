      <p class="post-content">You go into the AVS Window and open the editor, then click on settings, and click on presets/hotkeys. At the bottom of the screen there should be a box checked that says "randomly switch presets." Uncheck that box to stop the switching.<br />

      P.S. - Jaheckelsafar, why didn't you just tell him?</p>

      <p class="post-content">He didn't tell him because he needs to learn how to use the forums. Otherwise he would continue to ask questions like this which will get people like Atero to start yelling at him. No offense Atero. This is at least why I wouldn't tell him.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I posted the question cuz i couldnt find it in the FAQ and i figured it was easier just to ask a simple question than to search endlessly when i couldnt find it. sorry</p>
