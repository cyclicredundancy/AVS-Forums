      <p class="post-content">Really, I mean he had to <b>not</b> search the forums for this question which has been asked before, then scroll to the visualisations section of the forums, then goto AVS, then AVS <b>presets</b>, then <b>reply</b> to a (totally unrelated) thread which already exists rather than posting a new one.<br />
      <br />
      Really quite a spectacular failure, I applaud thee sir :up:<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps, as sidd says, deserving some kind of award, "Least relevant reply ever" perhaps.</p>
