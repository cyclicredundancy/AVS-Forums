<div class="posttext">Hope this right place 4 this (if not could someone foward it 2 right place)<br />
   got over 2000 presets and set at 5 minute intervals figure it should be at least a week before I see one for a second time (that is if run 24/7)... but sometimes see same one 4 - 5 - 6 time a day. I know picking is random but don't seem random nuff (more like in a rut).  when had 2.80 it seemed more spread out ... so is it winamp 3 or is there something I can do to make MORE randomized???<br />
<br />
<br />
  not related but like some of winmap 3 but it crashed far, far,far more than 2.80 ever did (almost want the 2,80 back).<br />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, the randomization of AVS play isn't very random. There was a frontend written for AVS a couple of months ago. You may be able to dig up the tread on that in the main forum. I believe the last release had a random feature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In winamp3 under preferences there is a slide dohick that I think controls the amount of random pickin' goes on in selectin' tracks...was wonderin if that dohick could be somehow put in Avs to increase it's random pickin' ability???? I ain't gots 'nuff knowledge to be able to do myself---SO if someone with the knowledge has some spare time to mess with it and get it done... I would APPRECIATE it INMENSELY if it could be sent to me (and think everyone would like it if it could be made a permanent part of winamp3) :up: :up: :D<br />

                    THANKS,<br />

<div class="posttext">Doubt it'll happen, 'cause you need the source code for AVS to rewrite a part of it, and I don't think Nullsoft is giving it out.</div></div><hr />
