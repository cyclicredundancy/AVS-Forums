Anyway, while none of these will become my favorites, this pack is certainly a big improvement over the last one. Sure, your inexperience shows, as some of these are unreasonably slow (Bedazzled and Amber Waves) and most are a bit blocky. Still, you seem to have developed a style of your own, which is quite nice. The colours are great on some of these andd on most. Some of these feel like they do too little.... (Odyssey for example). Shimmer is too bright for its own good.<br />
<br />
Best: Beautiflow, Red Candy, Swirlique, Teal Deal 4th-July, Wave Force<br />
<br />
Get rid of: Devine, Rhythm Rock,  Color Trip</div></div><hr />

My comment about becoming one of your favorites was meant to be in jest, i failed to add a smiley, so i suppose i set myself up for that shot by Pak-9. :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your comments. I generally agree with you about the best and worst, except i really like Loopity Loop.<br />
<br />
By the way, what do you mean by &quot;blocky&quot;?</div></div><hr />
