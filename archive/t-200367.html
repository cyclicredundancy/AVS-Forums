			<strong>There's no purple in the rainbow?</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I tried to make a color-spectrum, but somehow i always get this disturbing gap between blue and red instead of violet and purple. Can anyone please help?

		thanks. but that was not quite my question. I've got more a &quot;thechnical&quot; avs problem here, I was wondering, why the colors merge correctly into each other, except from blue to red. Got any idea?

		I saw violet in a preset(don't remember which), I don't know if it's a legitimate AVS color, but you could try it.  <br />
<br />
I'm going to fiddle around with this some, and see what I cand do(if anything).<br />
<br />
*************************************<br />
Minor Fiddling around, nothing fancy.<br />
*************************************<br />
<br />
Grr, one step forward and two steps back.  It's not really what you want, but channel shift placed beneath the ssc will give you violet:):(  Unfortunately, it only shifts the problem.  Yellow and orange are now absent:(<br />
<br />
*************************************<br />
I'm off to tinker some more:)<br />

		I think I found some possible help.  In Pak-9's AVS 4 SE pack, there's a preset called &quot;Collaborations - Montana vs Pack-9 - Winterkitten.&quot;  It contains a rainbow with sort of a purple mist swirling around it.  There isn't a single color map in the whole darned thing, no invert either.  There are however,<br />
7 superscopes, + several other elements/apes at work.<br />
<br />
Unless somebody more experienced has your answer, and can give it to you off the top of their head, I'm going to try and isolate, what makes the purple.  I'm almost positive your scope needs more code.  What I'm not sure of is whether or not you will need at least one more ssc to make the effect you want.

		Quick disclaimer, since I'm still very new, I don't know how much this will help, but it's from the preset I was telling you about.<br />
____________________________________<ul><li><u>init</u><br />
p=acos(-1); n=128;</li>
<li><u>frame</u><br />
af=min(h,w)/max(h,w);</li>
<li><u>beat</u> <br />
vv=getosc(0.45,0,0);</li>
<li><u>point</u><br />
r=i*p-p*0.5; d=0.2;<br />
x=af*sin(r)*d; y=-cos(r)*d+0.25;<br />
red=c*0.75; green=0; blue=c*0.9;<br />
c=if(above(abs(vv),0.5),0.5,1);</li>

That makes a purple arc.

		- Don't use linesize=h for a fullscreen gradient since linesize is capped at 256, there for your gradient will &quot;break&quot; after that and most of the people do use taller window size than 256. Instead center the line at the y-axis and then just use a movement with y=0.<br />
<br />
- If you use a numpoint value that depends on the screen size it is best to define it per frame, that way it will have enough points even if the user changes the resolution without reloading the preset (entering fullscreen for example).<br />
<br />
- The AVS window goes from -1 to 1 on both x &amp; y axis, so when you define x=(i-0.5)*3 it ranges from -1.5 to 1.5 and there for you're drawing stuff that's <b>outside</b> the screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and here's a simple method for doing a rainbow gradient, but im too lazy to explain it.<br />
<font size="1">(gah, <b>fine</b>, so i <u>can't</u> explain it :igor: satisfied? :()</font>

		thank you all for your efforts! I've got a free minute right now, so i can work through your tips! Hopefully i'll get it to work...<br />
@ nolita: i remember this preset but infortunately the rainbow is rendered by a few sperated lines, so i cannot (or am to stupid to) use it. ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry, tug, for those &quot;noobish mistakes&quot;.<br />
Normally i do use just a single-line scope + y=0 movement and i keep (i-0.5)*2..., but since i was concentrated on the color code on this one i didn't pay attention to formality. :p<br />
<br />
However, it's just what i was looking for. But you have to explain one thing: why do you add 2.07 / 4.14?? I changed the values in my code from $pi/2 and $pi to yours and voil√°: it works!! Any idea??<br />
<br />
-----------EDIT----------<br />
<br />
I got it!!!<br />
2.07 is roughly 2/3 * $pi (so 4.14 is 4/3 * $pi). So i just shifted the color phases by the wrong values. Damn! How stuuupid!!!

		Thanks for this one too!<br />
It also illustrates the &quot;technical background of the color spectrum. (The three sinus-waves: red green and blue, and the amount their phases are shifted against each other).<br />
Nice work!

		Yay!<br />
<br />
I'm happy the violet question has been answerred.:D  Only now I'm lost again.:(  In Tuggummi's spectrum the following code is used for the color:<br />
<br />
red=sin(ipi+2.07+t)*intes+bright ;<br />
green=sin(ipi+4.18+t)*intes+bright ;<br />
blue=sin(ipi+t)*intes+bright<br />
<br />
It introduces terms/variables to code that I hadn't seen before.  intes+bright  ;  I have to ask, are there other terms that I would never think to include in code?  Is there a place where I can find a list of these &quot;unconventional&quot; terms/variables?  Mind you I'm not entirely sure variable is the right word.  I searched and searched, even using words like tutorial, list, and variables. <br />
<br />
BTW, just from a single color perspective, I'm trying a theory of any color being possible by converting hex to rbg.  I have no idea if it will work though:)

		Correct me if I'm wrong, don't you just have to use the hue saturation and lumenise(sp) color values then convert them into red green and blue?

		Nolita, those aren't any &quot;real&quot; terms/variables, i just named them that way :) There are only a very few variables that are taken, those include x,y,w,h,i,red,green,blue,b and linesize for superscope and x,y,w,h,b and alpha for dynamic movement.<br />
<br />
The rest is custom, so when i named a variable 'intes' it should be pretty obvious when you change it, it changes the intesity of the colors :) and i think you know what 'bright' means ;)

		[sp fix] intensitiy, not intesity<br />
<br />
Other fixed variables are for:<br />
<b>effect lists</b>, <u>alphain</u>, <u>alphaout</u> and <u>enabled</u> (and <u>beat</u> instead of b) <br />
<b>bump</b> <u>b</u> gives -1/1 instead of 0/1. <br />
//edit - thanks tuggummi: and <u>bi</u> for bump intensity<br />
<b>Movement</b> uses <u>sw</u> and <u>sh</u> instead of w and h.<br />
<b>Texer2</b> uses <u>sizex</u> and <u>sizey</u> for image resolutions (1=100%)<br />
<br />
That's about it, I think

		Too bad the HDD is only 0.99Gb. Together with all programs I need to work with, depending on the size of the temporary internet files (which I have to delete from time to time because the drive's full (not that I am not asked to clean up my hdd with every reboot as it is (which happens ~3x per day due to BSOD's))) leaves me 20Mb max. <br />
//takes a deep breath<br />
Okay, 20MB is more than enough, and since WA crashes not more often than my PC, that doesn't matter too. (That's my PC being bad, not AVS so good)<br />

		Speaking of taking all of 5 minutes to do something:  Pak-9, would you mind terribly if I took your tutorial and convert it to html?  I wouldn't change it beyond linking each section from the table of contents to it's corresponding page.  I only want to do that so it's easier to use.  I'm just asking because I know some people hate when you just up and convert one of their documents to html.  Right now I'm using find, but being able to click a link to the specific page(s) I'm looking for would be easier.

It stood rusting away when I started working here. I first removed the dust and spiders, then it seemed to be working. (I'm the third trainee in a company that usually only has two (part of my education), so I don't even have my own screwdrivers and stuff, I need to share with an other trainee :down: ).<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about fixing my 386 SX 33MHz with 4Mb RAM too one day, but I'm not sure If I would use it when it works again.<br />

		@ WOTL<br />
So you've got an old 386 laptop and also 4MB old (SIMM or DIMM?)-RAM? If you find some other things you should open a museum, why not earn some extra money? I could donate a single 286 processor (unforunately it was soldered onto the mainboard so now it is a slightly damaged souvenir).<br />
<br />
@PAK-9<br />
btw is there any interest in a translated version?

Please, send it; I have no difficulty desoldering about anything at my work if it'd still work. :D

right, it was hboy who found a notebook at home. Must have mixed it up. :confused:<br />
<br />
Are you skillful enough to selder the cpu onto another mainboard again? Wow, that would really be difficult, since the lenght of the pins varies cause they were broken off roughly. ;)

		well, they have to be long enough to make it to the other end of the board of course, or else there's nothing to make conatact with the soldering islands (translated litterally from Dutch) when I solder it.

Given that the guide has only been downloaded about 400 times I doubt the demand is really there. If one abmitiously estimates that 5% of the readers are of your given translation language your aiming for an audience of about 20 people... thats a lot of work for 20 readers.

I think that won't be possible anymore... I just now brought it up again from a dusty well hidden box and had to see that this part of hardware history is defnitely out of order. :(<br />
<br />
@PAK-9<br />
I had no idea about how many people actually were interested in your tutorial. (probably because i find your tutorial so great, there have been thousands downloading it in my thoughts ;)).<br />
However, in that case we should be content with your .doc and nolita's html version (anticipating it's completion).

		Excuse me?  I totally stuck it on the back burner(waiting for Matt to do make the html).  I don't think you should wait for Pak-9's final version of the manual because ideally there will never be a final version of the manual.  That's because ideally there will never be a &quot;final&quot; version of AVS.  There will continue to be new innovations, with everything from APEs to the program itsself.  <br />
<br />
I think it's similair to any other software manual, or book.  I have more than one Photoshop manual, and book.  Also more than one 3DS Max book.  It's because there has to be a manual for each version.  Just because someone has everything from earlier versions of an app down pat doesn't mean they understand a newer version, or a new plug-in or in AVS APE.  That's not even counting when new people &quot;discover&quot; an application.<br />
<br />
You just do it, then submit it to Pak-9 and wait for him to check it out and approve it.  Realize the version we read and love will expand over time, some parts may become obsolete(if something that works better comes along of course), still some new parts will have to be added.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Pak-9 will have to continue making new versions all by himself.  I mean he may decide he doesn't want to, or might find himself swamped and without the needed time.  If the manual is in the spirit of AVS, I'm sure he won't mind if other people helped out.  It's a community service he has provided, and he should be very proud, or at least feel a great deal of satisfaction that so many of us do indeed appreciate it.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not entirely sure that ^..^ meant to type &quot;nolita's html version&quot;  it might have just been a slip of the tongue via the fingers/keyboard.

		i'm sorry about this misunderstanding. It seemed to me like nolita would do it. Sorry matt, i didn't intend to offend you. I hope you are pleased again when i revise that last sentence:<br />

Joking apart, i hope that anyone will finally do the html version. I think it would be for the public benefit (at least it would be worth the work ;))<br />
<br />
However, i'm sorry if you got hurt :cry:. I know that feeling: It's worst when my mother is on the phone with my grandparents (just to take one example). She can calmly talk about me, whithout even recognizing that i'm sitting next to her :confused:
