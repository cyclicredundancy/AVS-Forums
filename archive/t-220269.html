<div class="posttext">hi i know im new here and stuff, but i need some help<br />
<br />
like, my video card has a video out that can output to a tv... what i want is to make avs output to the TV<br />
it would be even better if i can put the normal, primary monitor facing behind the TV and show the AVS editor on there<br />
<br />
i have a geforce 4 mx and i can get stuff to show on the TV (like cloning my desktop or spanning it) but like, since the TV has a much lower resolution , i thought it would be nice to output to the TV at 320x240 or whatever and get very good performance from AVS....<br />
<br />
::edit:: and i want the TV to only show AVS and nothing else, as in in the event of a crash i just want the TV to go blank and not show the desktop or whatever</div></div><hr />

seriously, that's been answered like a hundred times<br />
drag the avs window to the 2nd monitor and activate overlay mode</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">most of the results in there were from this forum, anyway<br />
<br />
i still have trouble comprehending the meaning of 'overlay' tho, not as easy as some people here make it sound<br />
<br />

<br />
And it's even simpler if you have a dual vga head or 2 video cards into your comp. Just set primary display (in windows xp display settings) to the screen where you want the overlay.<br />
Move icons &amp; task bar from the overlay screen to the other. <br />
<br />
<br />
but thats what im afraid of... if winamp crashes, the window that tells me that winamp has crashed would probably be on the primary monitor and its utterly unacceptable to show something like that on the main screen in a club<br />
what i think will be helpful is if i can use this overlay thing (never tweaked with it before using the nvidia control panel) to put it on the secondary display somehow<br />
i'll figure it out i guess, thanks for helping<br />
<br />
im still trying to figure this out (http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;oi=defmore&amp;q=define:overlay)<br />
<br />
as seen from here (http://www.tweakguides.com/NVFORCE_7.html) it appears that nvidia's 'full screen video' controls is the closest thing to ati's 'theatre mode' or something...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Overlay: # a transparent sheet (either clear or mylar matte film material) accompanying a map, on which information, colouring, or symbols are entered so that when the overlay is placed on the map the effect is identical to having entered the overlay information on the map, itself.<br />
<br />
btw, what is your nVidia question??? (I actually use ATi, but maybe able to help)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well ive been able to slightly figure it out by myself... like i can choose which screen the overlay goes to... like if i set the screens to clone, i can either select the primary or secondary display, and if i use the 'dualview' mode i can make it autoselect the screen that doesnt have the overlay currently running... however, when i tried the clone + secondary or primary monitor function, all i get is a zoomed view of my desktop on one screen and avs running fullscreen on another, and if i use dualview + the overlay autoselect thing, both the screens have avs running as if they are cloned... i know it sounds confusing when i try to describe it, but thats how it was when i tried to make it work...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">err matt, that definition was for a physical overlay, aka a piece of transparency like the ones you put on an OHD</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah i guess you just imagine that happening digitally somehow, then you pretty much got the idea of what an overlay is... or something... <br />
<br />
like if the normal display data like your windows etc are the 'map' , then an overlay will be the video card replacing a certain part of whats shown on the screen with something else... but i would like to know how it works exactly, and how to get it to work properly on my machine...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">it shares a very rough similarity, but it's not quite the same.<br />
a gfx card overlay replaces all parts in a certain color with the contents of the overlay</div></div><hr />
