      (oh btw, does anyone know if they repealed that incredibly stupid law? why dont they just ban handguns like the UK?(i wish the US would do that, but there are too many conservatives who need a gun under their pillow to feel safe(morons :mad: )))</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure if the law has been repealed, but remember that Greece doesn't have large industries lobbying for laws like some countries (*cough* US *cough*).<br />
      <br />
      Oh and there's no point in trying to take away the US-residents' "God given right to bear arms". Nevermind the fact that the presence of weapons makes people more aggressive and that most highschool shootings wouldn't have happened if daddy's handgun wasn't lying in his bedside drawer.</p>

      I'm not up on my US constitutional trivia (living to the north and being blisfully unaware of such things), but I don't think things can be removed from the constitution.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I disagree.<br />
      It is very...er..untrivial (?)<br />
      But it is frustrating that people will not change it WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED (ie "right to bear arms" made sence when there were "redcoats" invading, but it is ridicious now)<br />
