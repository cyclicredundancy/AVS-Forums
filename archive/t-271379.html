      it's called "opus IV" and it's made up of 25 presets. these are presets i've never released before, or presets i've remixed and three bonus presets. :D<br />
      you can find the pack here: http://customize.org/mykalReborn/gallery, along with my other packs :D.<br />
      i'll be releasing it on winamp.com pretty soon. hope you guys like it.<br />
      cheers!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fucking Awesome.<br />
      For the first work i've seen from you it's pheneomenal even. I swear i almost came into my pants when i saw <i>14b vlad the_blue65</i>. Im a junkie for spectrum presets and this one delivers more music response than any of my presets ever. Awesome essence squuezed in a tube i tell ya!<br />
      <i>Church windows</i>, the zoom effects make my head spin :D<br />
      <br />
      Overall the aesthethic construction in the presets is top notch, <i>Child seeds</i> is one good example of making an old effect still look good. And i like your use of frames in many of your presets, gives them a edge that differs them from the regular avs work.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, very good work and i like it very much personally since i haven't seen your previous work, so it came as a big happy surprise for me :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks for the good feedback. 14b vlad the_blue65 is not mine, it belongs to a friend of mine. he's pretty good with coding, but his aesthetical skills lack a bit.<br />
      but i may help him with the look of his presets and he will release a pack pretty soon i thik. stay tooned!</p>

      <p class="post-content">some of these hit me right where i want it. I love presets with great colorschemes, being a colourjunkie and all. generally, the i like the flowpresets in the first half of the pack all have their qualites with the colourschemes but the standouts are in the latter half in the pack and my favs from the pack is.<br />
      drawing angels - very stylish, love the concept, good color &amp; beatreaction<br />
      universaly speaking - great, i think it would be cool if it had more to the cameramovement than spinaround-&gt;in-&gt;spinaround-&gt;out-&gt;spinaround but still a good preset.<br />
      frame wire - this puts my remix of wireframe to shame, simple yet good execution.<br />
      church windows - waow, yeah, i get what tug is saying with the headspinning comment, good kalediopresets has been done since day one, but this is very nice done<br />
      sfajh - love the concept, nice beatresponse<br />
      dragonheart summer - great, simple concept yet very stylish and i love the many shades of colour</p>

      <p class="post-content">::drawing angels - it's very cool, just that.<br />
      do behave - is nice<br />
      ::we are all made of stars - it's definitely hurting, but it's also something fresh, i like it, but not for too long...<br />
      ::freedom not liberty - yesss! fav so far<br />
      ::where is the octopus - slick but seen too often<br />
      ::(bo)real really nice colors and layering effect. the colors flatten out on purple a bit often though..<br />
      ::the first cup of tea - that one's a cracker even w/ the green bar at the bottom. the colors rock here!<br />
      ::sfajh - really like the concept and the coloring even more, sadly there not as much happening as i'd wish to. i think i'll just have to remix/remake this one :)<br />
      ::self-proclaimed - the kind of preset that makes me go: "hmm very nice comic effect here, but i can see the MPs *point,point*" and that would make the average viewer go wow i guess [w/o the text that is]<br />
      ::universally speaking - i have to say... nice, nice! oh, wait it looks nebula on a lower res, hm what did you want to achieve, starfield [600x450], which i prefer, or nebula [300x225]?<br />
      <br />
      resolution-independent texer sizes are definitely needed in this pack and they are easily done: just multiply your sizex/y with the screen height [or -witdh if you prefer] and then multiply by 0.001 or sth to make them smaller again - that's it! i use this:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>//frame box<br />sizer = h*.003;<br />//pixel box<br />sizex = [yadayada]*sizer;<br />sizey = sizex;</code>
</pre><br />
      many presets look totally different in different resolutions.<br />
      <br />
