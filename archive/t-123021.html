      <p class="post-content"><strong>New AVS-er trying to get his name out there</strong><br />
      :winamp: Okay, here's the stuff--I started monkeying around with AVS about a year ago, but my work was waaaaaay too crappy starting out to be worth a first pack until recently. I finished putting pack one, "Gemroc" together about a month ago, so it's been bouncing around in my computer since then. I'll put it up here tomorrow-ish so people can take a look. Any other designers whose shiznit I borrowed (e.g. the occasional DM or SSC) are cited in my comments, so I don't want to hear any bitching about not giving credit. Anything that doesn't have a citation is 100% MY WORK, so if on some off chance you like an effect I used please Please PLEASE give me credit for it. I'm kinda an asshole about that.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I figured it was about time I got the pack out there; besides, I started work on "Audiomancer2: Angel of Destruction" three weeks back and am up to 10 presets, and it would be sort of sad to finish my 2nd pack before I even release the first. Gemroc's a big pack--55 presets out of a couple hundred I've done (read: all the presets that DIDN'T suck goats...)and it uses some bitmaps and a few of UnConeD's APE files, which are included to save you the trouble of finding them. Any comments by fellow AVS-ers (ESPECIALLY AVSociety or Finnish Flash members)or just average eye-candy junkies are welcomed.<br />
      <br />
      I'm hungry enough to eat the ass out of a dead llama, so I'll head off now. Look for the Gemroc download in my next post--you might find it interesting, at least.<br />
      <br />

      Peace,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah... sorry about that. Wasn't really all that awake last night. I noticed the edit button later... and repented of my sin. Fortunately, that kind of stupidity isn't USUALLY reflected in my presets...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I tried to upload my pack last night but the forums were having issues with my name or something--wouldn't let me on. The presets will be posted this afternoon, soon as I can get to my comp. Sorry for the delay, all.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Okay, to whet some appetites...</strong><br />
      Now that I think of it, I have some of my presets installed on my network ID's folder... in case I get bored. So here's a few of them, as "appetizers" of a sort. Enjoy. Just drop them into the "plugins/avs" folder in Winamp2<br />

      <p class="post-content">Pretty good, youve got some nice effects in there, i see you have some decent knowledge of DMs and SSs. Some of them are a little to chaotic/dots type thing for my liking but still pretty good<br />
      <br />
      11 creation theory - pretty nice, could use a little something else but otherwise good, not much work on your part though. But still looks good.<br />
      23 frotee licious - Now this i do like, i like the effect got through the bump and thecolours, maybe have the shape in the background morph around, change distance rotation, etc etc. Just beat responsive stuff basically. Otherwise very nice.<br />
      26 I can hear heaven - Not bad, good colors and overal;l effect but the SS just looks like poo (to me anyway), its one of those primitive add a tan somewhere and lines go across the x axis along with the rest of it type of thing.<br />
      45 Sugar coated secrets and softly spoken lies - I like this one apart from the fact that it zooms too far out, its just plain annoying. It should zoom in and out to a certain extent but not that far out, just as far so that it just fills the sdcreen. Otherwise, very nice looking.<br />
      49 the blossoms were alive - Nice looking, could use a little something else to it, some rotation or maybe images appearing in between the snow, that would make a good preset, maybe some zooming in and out.<br />
      31 Leonid rain - Really like this, love the dripping effect. Good work, like the colour scheme, i dont like the white flashing away and what the water does to the colours. Otherwise, nice.<br />
      <br />
      Pretty good overall, they need some work but youve got the basic idea, you need to make your presets a bit more beat responsive, you seem to have some decent knowledge of code but you should learn more about it before you release. Good work though.<br />

      <p class="post-content">fyi, (the majority of) avsociety is about as talented as an eggplant.<br />
      <br />
      basically I have two tips:<br />
      1: stay away from only beat-responsive presets<br />
      2: use the effects like they're supposed to be used (i.e. bump should be used outside an effect list, as a 3D model, not inside it as a not-so-pretty lighting source...sorry, i've just got a boner for bumptrans right now ;) )<br />
      you might want to check out my avs primer :down: too. it'll be updated soon (if I get off my arse and work on it :rolleyes: )</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright, decent presets, but could use some work.<br />
      <b>23</b>- The movement is constant, have it change(edges more around). Could use some better FPS. Here's some optimizations: take out the water(looks better without it IMHO), optimize DMs(i.e. change 1.414*0.4 to .5656 and x/w-1/w to (x-1)/w and use the variable pi etc.) and the movement(multiply out numbers), take out first brightness filter(doesn't do too much) and maybe the second one too, and optimize SSC(calculate sqrt(2) in init, don't multiply by 1/w(just divide by w) and what is the point of acos(cos(...))? and why did you define pi if you still use 3.1415927?)<br />
      <b>26</b>-Very nice, reminds me of paranoya(one of my favorite AVSers). Here's some opts: Moving particles aren't that noticible and can be removed(plus I don't really like them),blur isn't necessary,first beat clear screen isn't necessary(the preset will fix itself),3 starfields are kinda insane, and DM could use a little speeding up(change bt=if(above(bt,0),bt-btd,bt); to bt=bt-btd*above(bt,0); etc.). Also, make it do something more and calm down the superscopes some more.<br />
      <b>45</b>-Don't use rotoblitter(use a DM), and what is a replace/replace effectlist? take that out:p . Your SSC could also use a bit larger rotation and optimization. Also looks good if you take out the mirror(no longer a kaleidiscope but it shows the SSC's better)<br />
      <b>49</b>-Color clips don't seem to have an effect. Neither does the interference. The effect list makes it look kinda nasty too.<br />
      <b>31</b>-I just don't really like this one. It gave me a headache with the flashing. The water bump can go. As can at least one fast brightness. Find another way to do the brightening.<br />
      <b>05</b>-Pick one or two effects and stick with them. Make seperate presets with your favorites.<br />
      Overall stars:3. Do what Raz and Atero said, optimize, and etc. Decent presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry to break it to you, but these aren't that great presets... But hey, if the thing that you didn't release the first presets you ever made is true then :up: for you for having some common sense! (i didn't have, when i made my first pack)<br />
      <br />
      Not all of them are bad, I like <i>49-Sten-The Blossoms Were Alive</i> &amp; <i>31-Sten-Leonid Rain</i>.<br />
      <br />
      Keep working.</p>
