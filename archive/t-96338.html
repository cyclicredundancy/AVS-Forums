			<strong>hard configuration ..without result</strong><br />
		
		

		hi there<br />
<br />
Just for fun i mount a hi hardware configuration on pc..<br />
i run AVS plugin...ok so..but in hi resolution..AVS is slow ..so slow in fullscreen ( resulution demanded :1600*1200).Have you got an idea about it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Configuration<br />
Intel mother board 850EMV2<br />
graphic card : GeForce Ti 4400<br />
Pentium 4 2,5 GHz<br />
Resolution 1600*1200<br />
<br />
of course the last driver, the last winamp version, , directX 8.1<br />

		:( I though an experienced user such as yourself would have learnt to read the FAQ (or even the search button:confused::(). Which is a sticky at the top of this forum.:) I am not going to link to it for you.:)<br />
<br />
A sweet machine but still (I would have thought I only have a 1.4Ghz T-Bird) not powerful enough to run AVS at those resolutions. You should get 800x600x32 bit at a reasonable 20fps(??Guess?) on semi complicated presets.<br />
<br />
So your options are get a fancy pants 3d accelerated plug-in (you know r2e, Tripex, Milkdrop, etc) that uses your graphics card or get a faster processer.:);)<br />
<br />
Hey folks how many is it this month now asking the same question 3...4...5?? All that time wasted on the FAQ Steve:)

<br />
:weird:  gluups.but ...i never think that the question was asked with this kind configuration that's why i have post it there ;) <br />
<br />
i have already use RÃ©, milkdrop tripex without problem in hi definition...and with a less hard col configuration so ..what 's my matter with avs :blah:

		Ok with Duo latest Envision II - a nice, new detailed pretty complex pack with my processor 1.33Ghz AMD T-Bird slighly overclocked to about 1.37Ghz runs on average at true 640x480x32bit 100% screen size half way on the render options  at 4-8 fps so use that as benchmark. For that pack you will probably double fps that or so with your spec.<br />
<br />
So a 5Ghz machine in future will run that pack at maybe 1024x768x32 at maybe 20fps<br />
<br />
As I said it is all in the FAQ - That it is slow and use no 3d acceleration. You may be surprised to know that some of us here are clued up about technology.;)<br />

		Well here's an idea: make a sticky in the AVS troubleshooting with the same title as the faq and have it link to it. I think here's what most people do:<br />
<br />
- I have a problem... let's visit the forums.<br />
- &quot;Plugins.... AVS&quot; Ok *click*<br />
- &quot;AVS presets&quot;? no.<br />
- &quot;AVS wishlist&quot;? no.<br />
- &quot;AVS troubleshooting&quot;? aha! *click*<br />
<br />
And they never see the sticky post containing the FAQ.

But you lose all the aesthetic quality if you use MD!<br />
