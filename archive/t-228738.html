<div class="posttext">I recently downloaded Winamp 5.1, and my AVS performance is HUGE. My everage framerate has actually tripled and I haven't changed any display settings. Is it just, I don't know, Windows XP SP2 (Which I have recently downloaded) or something, or some MASSIVE overhaul in AVS itself. <br />
<br />
I figured you were the guys to ask...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I came back from a long vacation, so I'm not sure. I think it was v5.93.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That must've been 2.93 then since the newest version is 5.1<br />
AVS got some huge improvementes in 5.01<br />
<br />
thanks for sharing!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I meant 5.093. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, such a huge performance boost is really great! But i also can't find a really reasonable explanation for this. Perhaps you had &quot;Wait for retrace&quot; enabled (under AVS display settings) all the time before and now after the winamp update it was disabled somehow? But actually that would not have given you so much more fps in all presets and also you said that no display settings got changed.<br />
So maybe you had set winamp to the highest processing priority while AVS was running with a lower one and now after updating winamp the priorities were equalized (=set to default values) again?<br />
<br />
Well i guess you should just enjoy your luck! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well... <br />
<br />
<br />
Now that you mention it, the Wait for Retrace checkbox is off...<br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly does it do? Why does it slow down the speed? My thread priority is the same as winamp, what would you recommend? (Winamp's is normal.)<br />
<br />
My average rate is now about 256 at 500x500 resolution, no pixel doubling. VERY cool.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Wait for raytrace&quot; will wait until your monitor refreshes before redrawing rather than writing to the screen as fast as it possibly can. Most people switch it off because it results in better frame rates.<br />
What it actually does is writes to the buffer as fast as it can, the monitor still updates at its refresh rate (60fps normally), so that if wait for retrace is turned off the contents of the buffer can be 'half-written' when the monitor draws its frame, giving 'cuts' across the image where two halfs of two different frames have come out together. <br />
<br />
This was in some old thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=222879), i find it to be the most well put explanation and easy to understand :)</div></div><hr />

which presets are you running JFASI? Maybe you only have &quot;render/ring + trans/rotoblitter&quot; presets running! ;)</div></div><hr />
