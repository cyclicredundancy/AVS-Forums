      I recently downloaded Winamp 5.1, and my AVS performance is HUGE. My everage framerate has actually <i>tripled</i> and I haven't changed any display settings. Is it just, I don't know, Windows XP SP2 (Which I have recently downloaded) or something, or some MASSIVE overhaul in AVS itself.<br />
      <br />
      I figured you were the guys to ask...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, such a huge performance boost is really great! But i also can't find a really reasonable explanation for this. Perhaps you had "Wait for retrace" enabled (under AVS display settings) all the time before and now after the winamp update it was disabled somehow? But actually that would not have given you so much more fps in all presets and also you said that no display settings got changed.<br />
      So maybe you had set winamp to the highest processing priority while AVS was running with a lower one and now after updating winamp the priorities were equalized (=set to default values) again?<br />
      <br />
      Well i guess you should just enjoy your luck! :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now that you mention it, the Wait for Retrace checkbox is off...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      What exactly does it do? Why does it slow down the speed? My thread priority is the same as winamp, what would you recommend? (Winamp's is normal.)<br />
      <br />
      My average rate is now about 256 at 500x500 resolution, no pixel doubling. VERY cool.</p>
