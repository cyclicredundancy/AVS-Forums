<div class="posttext">Well, recently we came to the topic that this forum becomes kind of &quot;deserted&quot;. Why does this happen and what can we do against it? In my opinion AVS is the most promising visualisation mode winamp provides (concering the futher developement which is kind of broken concering the &quot;no further developement&quot; principle we get to know recently). Not only because of the opportunity to develope new APS's or so, but also because i like the AVS-visualisation idea most of all (just have a look what is possible with this dll).<br />
<br />
So im asking, what went wrong? And what can we do to provide this part of the forum from dying out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't have enough time to understand and make the new things work. To make presets it's taking an increasingly large amount of background knowledge to use these new APE's and other things you refer too. I may like AVS, but I can't make anything in the limited time I have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">it's not about new apes<br />
<br />
* it's slow and therefor only usuable on small windows... but screen resolutions are getting bigger and bigger every day<br />
* everything simple has already been done, you cant be creative<br />
* everything complicated requires huge ammount of knowledge and creativity<br />
* no hardware support whatsoevery<br />
* avs it not being developed anymore<br />
* it's impossible to do everything with apes<br />
<br />
as you sayd that avs is promising... but it will never get any better. in the matter of fact... WE can not do anything to prevent death of avs, it is inevitable. We just need new vis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm no specialist concerning plugin programming, so im asking: would it be possible to create a new modernized AVS? One that bears the things jaak said? I mean a vis that has kind of hardware support but where you make presets in an editor like avs has? Recently i tried to play with milkdrop (which actually has hardware support) but the editing-menu is too confusing there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">or if it was like c++ where you write the code yourself, and then if you run the executable it would function as a preset? maybe that would make sense. write the preset, in the avs editor, and when you want, you can try it out simply by starting it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">would that be possible? I mean the idea sounds interesting and might be a solution! But wouldn't it still need some kind of plugin that can &quot;integrate&quot; them into winamp? Which must be coded at first, but who can do do that?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">as i thought, sometime it becomes too extensive or the involved people lose their interest... Probably such an &quot;open source projekt&quot; is not practicable for that purpose, perhaps something like this has to be made by professional developers.<br />

<div class="posttext">I hope that there will be a new vis someday that works with code like we know it from avs. Cause im a lazy guy, you know..  ;) <br />
It's a pitty that i wont be able to help much on such a developement, cause i don't have any programming skills apart from avs.<br />
<br />
Btw, i want to add some thoughts to relieve the sinking of avs: First i noticed that this part of the vis-forum is the most frequent one compared to the other parts like milkdrop etc. They seem to have a much smaller community and/or are more deserted.<br />
Secondly, jaak you said that avs cannot keep pace with other vis cause of the resolution thing. But while the resolutions grow, the cpu-power also increases. I can't imagine that the resolution-demand increases much faster than the cpu-power. (or did i get you wrong?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think time is the big issue, most people have real lives and AVS is just a hobby, so that time has to be transposed into making a new visualisation program. I can think of a lot of people with the ability to make an AVS-like visualisation happen (Me, Jheriko, Coned, Tomy, Jaak off the top of my head) its whether or not people can be bothered to take the time.<br />
<br />
To be honest its a wider problem with open source projects, lots of talk, not much coding... it happens all the time.</div></div><hr />

1) can do low level optimizations in assembler<br />
2) are able to code gui<br />
3) know a lot about opengl and are familiar with GLSL<br />
4) have any experience with large c++ projects (this includes being good at team work)<br />

not so great to do stuff without a plan nor a project leader, as there is much to take into considertation and lot of planning needs to be done.<br />
<br />
but as coned sayd, it's good to test possible code, but not to assume that the testing code will make it to actual thingy even partly.<br />

<div class="posttext">yes of course, but what i wanted to say was that the basic coding skills became much more extensive since the beginning/during the last years.

<div class="posttext">well as a matter of fact.....i dont have too much coding skills or technical knowledge. But i make AVS presets? I do it because  I like it and i'm a firm believer that AVS presets dont neccesarily need to code heavy......Tugg has proved that in the past. Sometimes good aestheics rule over techincal stuff.<br />

<div class="posttext">well, actually i don't have great coding skills either but though am making presets.<br />
I just meant that in the beginning of avs you could throw some simple-scopes/rings together and garnish it with a blitter feedback/water or a mirror if you really wanted to be cool to make a nice preset. But today only the fewest people think this is a great preset. Hope now it's clear what i meant at first?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey i didn't want to offend you ishan!!! Your presets are much better than that. Sorry if you thought that refered to you! Most artists today, make better presets than just throw together some simple stuff.<br />
That example should only show, that the overall standard concerning presets has risen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The thing is people usually quote Tugg when they talk about good presets without lots of code, but actually most of Tuggs presets have a fair amount of code in them, okay it might be a bit 'creative' but its still higher than the average AVS'rs standard</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">However you might see it. I won't quit avs, just because someone says 'hey all presets made from now on have to be extremely code heavy'. That's stupid and contradicts the idea of visuals.<br />
<br />
Mr_nudge put it very nicely: 'AVS is to compliment your music'. First of all presets should underline the music people are listening to, then they can be something like a techdemo or something. Of course you should keep an eye on style/art. Cause that &quot;visual&quot; part of your music should be just as great as those songs itself.<br />
<br />
If you want to invent new techniques etc. why do you make it in avs? Most other programming languages are much more suitable.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps we should try to provide more help to the basis, i mean to the noobs/newbies? As long as im concerned most noobs that came here during the last weeks haven't been that annoying. So why should we flame on them, when we actually want avs to become more famous?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah. but how much more can we do than FAQ threads, Tutorials threads and the AVS troubleshooting sub-forum? Hell! theres even a Tips and tricks thread.

Please be so kind and forgive our usually very nice friend tug this time! Actually he stands under psychological care, but now and then he forgets to take his pills. Then he can become that hateful and condescending as you see it now. The doctor said it has something to do with an oppressed childhood and some other negative experiences concerning interpersonal relations. I hope this helps you to be lenient towards him. Thank you for your patience!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I won't steal it bro... Assuming from the look under the glasses you have moved to a more &quot;herbal&quot; method.<br />
Anyway - my opinion on the topic - tho you have said it pretty much - avs has been the same for years now, the only thing is that i became more of a coding discipline, not that it's bad tho. But nothing else, and when something doesn't change it slowly becomes inatractive to people... And we all might love that 332x227 window the world demands at least 1024 and above. Still out beloved doesn't need the VC /do not confuse with the WC, though it doesn't need it either/ it won't even ask us. Well eyecandy is all about it, fellas ;) We all prefer the pretty women. If AVS is about to change /quite unlikely from the wa developers/ it must change radically and still be easy to use. I mean easy - even for lames like me. <br />
<br />
PS I was wondering if people will recognise me :rolleyes: hoped for a flame or two, kidding ofcourse ;) but that date there really confuses me.

<div class="posttext">I think what PAK is trying to get across is that it can be directly inferred from your earlier statements that you dont have the required intelligence for his assistance to be of any valuable use. Although you would gain the knowledge you seek you won't actually become any more skilled at anything or anymore intelligent.<br />
<br />
Since you are clearly unable to determine the solution to simple problems by yourself, why should you be helped? So that you can bug us with more questions that eat up even more time later?<br />
<br />
Here is the solution in slightly simplistic logic, I have a dim hope that you might be able to glean more from this than the answer:<br />
<br />
pixels exist and have their colours set using cpu instructions<br />
<br />
cpu instructions take time, usually consistent for equivalent instructions<br />
<br />
setting the color of a single pixel therefore takes some relatively fixed amount of time, assuming that we use cpu instructions for this<br />
<br />
performing any per pixel operation adds an additional amount of time per pixel<br />
<br />
any additional computations needed add extra amount of time per frame 't'<br />
<br />
resolution is the width in pixels x the height in pixels... i.e. the number of pixels as an unexpanded multiplication.<br />
<br />
.: there is a direct relationship between render time and resolution which is independent of the cpu speed. i.e. no matter how fast or slow the cpu speed is this is always a linear proportion. The fact that it is linear means that there exists some constant k such that<br />
<br />
render time = k * resolution + t<br />
<br />
this may look promising as k decreases as cpu speed increases.. but in reality it means very little since there is still some linear relationship.<br />
<br />
what this means is that no matter how fast a cpu becomes (except infintely fast) higher resolutions will always produce slowdown, and the slowdown for a resolution with twice as many pixels will also be twice as big. <br />
<br />
also in more advanced renderers the amount of time used by 't' is generally getting smaller and smaller and so the bulk of rendertime becomes tied to this linear relationship.<br />
<br />
understand that this isn't a design flaw of these engines, it is because most of the 't' time in a rendering engine is used to calculate (visually) uglier hacks that simulate effects that need to be calculated per pixel to be accurate.<br />
<br />
this is just a feature of rendering to a 2 dimensional pixel buffer. it will never change, since the axioms of mathematics and logic need to change first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also remember google is your friend. and searching the forums too. do you know how many times this question has been asked here?<br />
<br />
<br />
how much do you like answering questions all the time? when you are intelligent you get very short tempered from a lifetime of being asked stupid questions, you simply become tired of explaining things to people because they are lazy or stupid. <br />
<br />
what is also (usually more) annoying is that these people typically make zero effort in solving their own problems and in time come to rely on smarter people helping them as a consequence. which creates a negative feedback loop...<br />
<br />
the net result over a large population is that people like this reduce the overall intellectual development of said population. as if that isn't bad enough it gradually leads to a retarding factor due to the fact that people are more likely to pass on this form of stupidity to their children and natural selection will stop favouring the more intelligent (since they are wasting their advantage by sharing it essentially). I could go on for months, short story is:<br />

Registration Date != noobness  <br />
<br />
meh.<br />
<br />
sometimes i agree with that. but how does one classify of being a noob after being someone whom was a decently known person for a while, then leaving out of loss of interest, then suddenly comes back with new found interest.<br />
<br />
<br />
frankly, just having this little discussion is enough to keep me here, btw :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can definitely see why AVS is going down. I mean, this is my first post in almost a year. What would save AVS more than anything would be having its own tab on the main winamp.com site. AVS presets are really not plugins, and AVS is released with winamp and was created by winamp developers.<br />
<br />
Also, you know how those old console (NES, SNES, SEGA, etc.) use those filter dealies to make low-rez images look good stretched to higher resolutions? Those would be great for AVS. If only there was a way to put them in.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if AVS dies, I'll at least poke it with a stick or something before finding something else with bright colors to distract me for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those filters you refer to are morphological processing operations that (as you say) improve the visual quality when resizing low res images; however AVS renders to a variable size resolution and as such they are innapropriate (many presets run fine in high resolution)</div></div><hr />
