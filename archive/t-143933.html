      <p class="post-content">I really like how abstract and ordered it looks! Everything just fits perfectly. However, although it's incredibly easy to look at, I wish it had some sound or beat reactivity. Figure out a way to make it react and this preset would be perfect. In any case, amazing work!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tried really hard to make the preset reactive, unfortunately the low framerate destroys most of the reactivity I added. For instance, the cubes only explode on beat and the camera spin direction is determined on beat by getosc, neither really notices that much. Now that its gotten to this stage I'm not particularly eager to modify it unless someone suggests something really amazing since I'd probably have to copy and paste tons and tons of code into all of those SSCs and DMs.<br />

      Thanks for the positive feedback guys.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a suggestion: You could just use SSC's and it'd be heaps quicker.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah it would be but the DMs look nice and glowy.. thats why I used them + I'm thinking of making the texture reactive in some fashion or other. Thanks for the advice though.</p>
