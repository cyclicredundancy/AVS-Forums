			<strong>Soothing black and white optical illusions</strong><br />
		
		

		Actually I believe this AVS already exist I just cannot find it. <br />
The idea would be clear white and black images that smoothly slide into each other. It should have no agressive feeling and give the feeling it all happens from a great distance. <br />
<br />
An example of a image that could help u get an idea what I talk about<b></b>:<br />
<a href="http://www.grand-illusions.com/images/pinwheel.GIF" target="_blank">http://www.grand-illusions.com/images/pinwheel.GIF</a> <br />
<br />
Basicly it should have a slow pace with the slow build up to 1 exception. People watching should be looking for details.<br />
<br />
Basicly a comfortable trippy experience that will not attack u in any way.<br />
<br />
I might be unclear of to demanding asking this. <br />
I wish I would find the original AVS I'm talking about but alas, no avail...<br />
<br />
The most important is it has no colours but only black and white or shades of those 2.<br />
<br />
Another idea might be putting a filter on it giving it an old black and white movie look.<br />
<br />
For those that accept the challenge I wish u the best of luck!

<br />
from now on you don't have to work on eye-catching &amp; code-heavy presets anymore, to attract your viewers. Just make a hypnotizing intro and everybody is gripped :p

I've been working on a pinwheel project for just over a week now. However, mine is composed entirely of SSCs, and as of yet, looks no where as good as that. Nice idea :D
