      Ive played with a few kaleidascopes and remixed a few of nic01's peices (Nic most were really impressive by the way).<br />
      These flow quite smoothly and are easier on the eye. They aren't the most technically advanced but the look good (which is the desired outcome right??)</p>

      <p class="post-content">A true kaleidoscope is a picture set back from the camera a certain distance with a certain number of mirrors perpendicular to the picture and the camera that cause a nice, multiple mirrored effect. Would be best implemented with a 3D-DM.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Would be best implimented with a static movement and *maybe* a rotozoomer. Kaleidoscopes aren't 3D - the image created is planar. (A mirror placed perpendicular to a planar image will result in a mirror image that is coplanar with the original - like a kaleidoscope).<br />
      <br />
      To do this you need to find out how to tile a triangular - or square - section of an image on a plane using trans/movement. The reflections of other polygons would be quite a bit more difficult to do, as they do not involve simple tiling...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well Ive made some real progress with the Kscopes. I'll upload on monday - I know they'll trip you guys out! Rotozoomers aren't the best for kscopes but work well in earlier layers. A movement filter using something like r=r*3 works very nicely - combined with some dynamic moves.</p>
