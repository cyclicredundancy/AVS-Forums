		So I`m in a band and we are thinking of running a dircet line off of the sound board into a computer and have some winamp visuals play in real time threw a projector. now i ask is this even possible and if so what kind of specs for a computer should i be looking at. thank you for ur time.

		yeah i found what i was looking for right after my post. but i still ask. waht kind of computer should i be looking into for optimum performance. if this comptuer is for visualization only. Would a 64bit processor be agood idea? high ram? resolution? and the likes any help would be appriciated.

		AVS is extrememly processor dependant, the faster the computer the better, and no, a 64bit processor would not be a good idea.<br />
<br />
The computational load of streaming sound from your soundcard's line in is almost insignificant unless you are talking about ridiculously high quality recordings.

		actually, every aspect of good hardware somehow affects framerates in avs, but the most significant performance is still covered by - as pakkie said - the CPU. when i had a video card upgrade (diamond viper 770 to ATI radeon 9000PRO128), i had a noticable fps boost too, but not that much. it just made presets more smoother.
