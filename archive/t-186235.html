      <p class="post-content"><strong>tapping beats?</strong><br />
      I would like it if there were a button on the beat detection config where you can just click out beats. It would be nice if the beat detector could hold up whatever bpm you're tapping out, or even try to align it to the nearest big peak, etc, but at least just be able to hit a button to generate a beat event.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can actually right that into the AVS preset code, but that requires a lot of coding and universal variables.<br />
      <br />
      It would probably use the getkbmouse(3) (<i>For the left mouse button</i>) function to some extent, along with using another variable to keep track of the frame count.<br />
      <br />
      So something like:<br />
      <br />
      <b>Frame</b><br />
      t=t+1;<br />
      reg01=t/(bt+1);<br />
      <b>Pixel</b><br />
      bt=bt+getkbmouse(3);<br />
      <br />
      That would get a relation between the amount of taps compared to time in respects to frame count.<br />
      <br />
      If someone can come up with a better way of doing it, go ahead.</p>

      <p class="post-content">horsefly: nope, because you have to track the transition of getkbmouse from 0 to 1. No-one can hold the mouse button for only 1 frame.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Simply use the bnot trick.</strong><br />
      I made a preset that will let me tap out the beats so I can compare it to a custom beat detection I am making. It is included without the custom beat detection. Press "a" when you have a beat and compare it to Winamp's default detection.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to note that the volume level scale is based on someone else's work but I can't remember the name.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>No because people are crap at keeping a beat so you'd need to take an average. A minute might be stretching it a bit tho, 20 seconds would probably be enough.

      <p class="post-content">It requires some skill, but if you can keep a beat this preset could be handy. You should tap with the beat not to it.<br />
      <br />
      Any better ways to do this?<br />
      <br />
      Did AvsManDan ever finish his custom beat detection?</p>
