      Another Preset of mine. It looks a little cool. Check it and see how good it is. I will listen to all comments even. Just please don't flame at me because you don't like it and get rude. Thank you. Also please keep upon topic. I need to think of what to do with it and see if I can make it look better from advance AVSers or ones who know what they are doing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the colorfade doesn't do anything when onbeat randomize is set (that is, the normal colorfade doesn't); thus it's rather unreliable...the r settings in the ddm are pointless as ddm ONLY affects d; that and you have that dm in there that does the same thing...the text render is obnoxious and cheesy...the set render mode is absolutely pointless, so you should get rid of it if only for the fps...whereas the scopes look good they are also coded inconsistently in and of themselves, and inconsistently with the dm/ddm, which leads me to believe they are stolen, though i know not from where. if i'm mistaken i apologize, but it does look that way to me...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice replacement of MPs with those SSCs. The effect is overdone though and the flashing is a bit annoying.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I understand even though I can't remember what the SSC's looked on that one. I have been modifiying it for a while now. It might have been, but I am not sure either. If you remember, just tell me. It may have came from my other thread I created for my other AVS. Well here is an update, It may still be a bit annoying, the color, but thats the only way you can see any reaction when the music is playing. So I will keep it like that for now I guess.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why did you make the circles from points when lines would do a much better and cheaper (in terms of FPS) job, especially when combined with a 'set render mode'?<br />
      <br />
      Try using pi=2*acos(-1) in 'Init', ad q=1;asp=h/w; to the end of 'Per Frame' and use:<br />
      <br />
      q=-q;<br />
      x=cos(pi*i)*.1+ax;<br />
      y=sin(q*i*pi)*.1+ay;<br />
      x=x*asp;<br />
      <br />
      'Per Point'. Now you can make a great looking circle with 200 points or even less if combined with a 'set render mode'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ishan, yet I have which I will give you credit for the codes and thats all. I am sorry. Heck no worries... Oh also only reason it looks the same is because how the mirror looks Ishan. Thats all. I will try your code out jheriko. Also Ishan, I won't give you full credit of that remix. Like I explained in the other post, you aren't getting full credit for a remix... only half. Thats all.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey I like your preset but it looks much like your last one. Ah Oh well, at least you know how to do this stuff. I'm just glad that I could make "vertical bouncing scope" horizontal.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's because "common people" who really only enjoy avs and are not so much into it as avs artist, really couldn't give a rat's ass about technical things. They only look the visuals, how they are done makes no difference whatsoever.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you Tuggummi. You are a true person. I truelly don't care if he post-pump though... just he needs to write a little bit more. It might advance him in our language, you know? Well I understand what you are talking about Ishan, I am sorry, but you yet get some credit. The avs is basic and I can't access it now since it is on my dad's computer and that is in South Carolina. I am now back at the home that I was raised in, in North Carolina. Well I am back and I will listen to any comments now I guess, even though I can't access it and there is no winamp player on this computer that I am on either. I have ask my older bro anyways; this is his computer not mine.</p>
