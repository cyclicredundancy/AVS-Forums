			<strong>Can't go back to windowed AVS</strong><br />
		
		

		Major problem! :p<br />
<br />
I've tested how avs looks in full screen, but I can't go back to windowed.<br />
I think that's because I resized the window larger then my screen... How do I get that small AVS window back?<br />
<br />
Please help me out.

		Close Winamp<br />
<br />
Find your winamp.ini file (for me it's in D:\program files\winamp)<br />
<br />
Open it and search for the line [AVS]<br />
<br />
You should see some lines like these (adjust to taste):<br />
wx=  [x position]<br />
wy=  [y position]<br />
ww=  [width]<br />
wh=  [height]<br />
<br />
I can't see what the fullscreen toggle line is, but I'll assume it's one of the cfg_fs_ ones.<br />
<br />
Once you've fixed up the file, save it and run winamp again.

		I wanted to say the same thing.. but when I checked, I noticed that I don't have a winamp.ini file in my winamp dir (or, after a search on my entire system on my computer at all) myself (5.53, but that shoudldn't be different in 5.54). If this would occur to me, I wouldn't have a clue of how to fix it.
