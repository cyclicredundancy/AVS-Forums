<div class="posttext">Hi, I'm using Winamp in Windows 7 x64 Ultimate. Everything's fine except... AVS. I loaded it up, loaded a preset and if I try to go into full screen it says something related to java crashed. If I try to run it in overlay mode (which is what I'd like to do) it just does nothing, no animation in the little overlay box or in the chosen color. Any way to fix this? I did a number of google searches but they came up with nothing, or posts from 2003-2005 that are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Application Versions:<br />
Windows 7 x64 Ultimate<br />
Winamp v5.572<br />
Java v6 update 20 (32-bit); in case it's relevant<br />
Java 64-bit not installed<br />
<br />
Computer (HTPC):<br />
MOBO: Zotac ION Geforce 9300+Wifi<br />
CPU: Intel C2Q Q9550<br />
RAM: 4GB<br />
HDD: 2.5&quot; 160GB<br />
Onboard Realtek Audio&gt;&gt;Optical&gt;&gt;Onkyo TX-SR607<br />
Onboard GPU (not in use): Geforce 9300<br />
PCIe GPU: Geforce 9800 GTX (latest nVidia non-beta drivers)<br />
DVI&gt;&gt;HDMI&gt;&gt;Onkyo TX-SR607&gt;&gt;HMDI&gt;&gt;Samsung 55&quot; Series 7 LEDtv<br />
<br />
I think I've covered all bases, any help would be much appreciated, I've been using Winamp since the fastest PC you could buy was 400Mhz, I don't plan to change any time soon. My major purpose for doing overlay was to make a background with part of it being magenta colored using that as the overlay section and the rest still be wallpaper. Also if this can be done with Milkdrop that would work fine as well but I didn't see it in the options.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you cannot do overlay mode on win7 and for fullscreen well i'm using vvvv (http://vvvv.org) for screenshooting avs since avs's native fullscreen mode isn't the best i think.<br />
p.s.: avs has nothing to do with your motherboard, HDD, soundcard, gpu's even their drivers and your displays. actually it uses only the cpu and a little of ram and it's programmed in c++.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks, I figured that overlay wasn't compatible after reading something about EVR.<br />

I figured but I'd rather include the information than not and get bitched at about it. :p</div></div><hr />
