			<strong>AVI / Render BUG !</strong><br />
		
		

		Hello,<br />
<br />
There is a BUG whitin 'render / AVI' in AVS plugin.<br />
It existed a year ago but I though that you will fix it...<br />
<br />
...but you did'nt :)<br />
<br />
The problem is if you put 'render / AVI' in list and change the files of AVI Stream (while it works ofcorse), sometimes it just stops and crash the winamp, and if change the files rapidly with the keyboard (down or up arrow) it always crashes after few secs...<br />
<br />
Please, please fix it :)<br />
<br />

		what avs are you using?  if it's 2.6 then that'd be your problem.  go root around for an old copy of winamp with avs 2.5(.1), it's much more stable

		I have been using AVS for 2 years... so I think I have tried all the versions :)<br />
<br />
Thanx for your reply but that is not a solution for this problem.

		I have not had this problem before...<br />
<br />
I personally would say that your problem is using Render/AVI.  Try to find something better to use - if that bug happens often enough to really create a problem, then you should probably use something else.  AVIs aren't that great in AVS - kinda defeats the purpose...

		And I'm not exactly sure who you're reffering to, since we can't actually repair things that come standard with AVS. We're just a bunch of people who happen to like as well :).
