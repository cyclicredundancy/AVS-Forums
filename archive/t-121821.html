<div class="posttext">I just saw 3 of the worlds best VJ's on the weekend, and 3 of Australias best lighting technicians, plus 3 of the worlds top psytrance djs. About $120,000 worth of projectors across 8 screens. The lighting team completely blew my fking mind - the 30 metre fire breathing serpent swimming around the lake, the 10 metre high fire breathing dragon, - with about 100 naked fire performers creating effects that would reflect in the water below - creating a freakn awesome 'live' music visualer. Everywhere I looked (up/down/left/right) was like a complete sensory overload. WAS partying inside someone elses lucid acid dream. <br />
<br />
Im sorry - I really can't get excited by unmixed avs in a pub. If you want to go further with vjing - there's alot more to learn than how to put on someone elses presets. Have fun finding out!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well i did have that gig on friday and all went well. I played AVS for about 6 hours with 3-4 shutdowns. I played on a single monitor because I didnt have the cable to connect the projector via TV-out<br />
(it's not very plesent if winamp shuts down in the midlle of the projection, even more so if you have only one monitor:D). At first I played under windows 98 because my sound controls in XP were still on the other monitor from the last projection:). But after a couple of sistem crashes I tried using my monitor as the secondary monitor to get the sound controls (which was all OK),but then I couldnt reach the display controls which were now on the other screen:D. So I had to get it back by randomly pulling from the other screen which is not easy. Then I noticed that the cursor comes back with the selection rectangle (when i missed the window) or without it ...and the point is XP is a lot beter because only winamp crashes:D. <br />
Anyway I played a lot of presets, like I said at least one of everyone on my comp:)(2725 presets curently installed) and people loved them, some even said that those were the best visuals they ever saw:D YAY.What they liked the most is the fact the visuals reacted to music and they obviusly didnt mind the fact that all I could do is switch to next, previous and random:D. <br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry - I really can't get excited by unmixed avs in a pub. If you want to go further with vjing - there's alot more to learn than how to put on someone elses presets. Have fun finding out!!!<br />
<br />
hey man its OK i didnt post it for you to get excited:). That party you described must have been a real blast(wish I was there):P. About that VJ part, I do it to get out every once in a while:) and free boze backstage is nice to:D. I do play my presets as well, there's just not enough of them for the whole night:). And yes I know there is a lot more to learn, there is allways a lot more to learn:).<br />
What I cant understand is why were you there if you think it was borring, I mean there is a clear shot of you on picture 11 :D<br />
(im sooo bad:D).  <br />
<br />
This has to be my lognest post I ever wrote, probably the most borring one as well:D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Maybe you should next time pick the visuals one by one and test about 10 times of switching between them. The goal is obviously select presets that don't crash your winamp :)<br />
<br />
Again, if it's not that important event it probably doesn't matter much, but changes favor of the prepared mind ;)</div></div><hr />

Still waiting to see a good one. :) I can often point at the screen and say 'that was out of time', etc.<br />
