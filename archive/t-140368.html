<div class="posttext">Nothing too spectacular here.  Just thought I'd share what I've learned and accomplished in my first couple weeks of AVSing.  Any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
No *.exe, so you'll have to extract yourselves.<br />
Please take a look ;)<br />

<div class="posttext">these are better than most n00b presets...good start.<br />
be sure to find the authors of DMs before publishing.<br />
in some presets, esp. molecular life, i noticed an overabundance of effect lists.   replace/replace effect lists can be removed/combined and your preset will go faster.  some of your presets aren't very asthetically pleasng because they are too busy.<br />
<br />
oh...use UnConeD's multiplier APE (search the forums) to replace multiple Fast Brites.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Solid Gold Melting Over A Green Sky - Hate the MP's.  Use something that is a bit more controllable.  Don't like the interleave and grain much either.<br />
Pool Of Life - Take out the MP's and put some nice SSC's in instead.  Change out the mirror for a nice DM.<br />
Ice Palace - The movement is horrible.  Not only does it create some really ugly dots, but it is static.  Replace it with a smoother DM.<br />
Initiation - With some cool moving SSC lines instead of the MPs and a slightly more dynamic DM, this could be a decent preset.<br />
Molecular Life - Replace/Replace EL's don't do a thing except slow the preset down(well, maybe not really slow it down, but they make it more difficult to look at the makeup of the preset) - just take everything out of the Replace/Replace EL's and then delete the EL's.  Also, I think that there is one unneeded DM in there, but I'm not sure.  Take out a couple of the Fast Brightness's and do whatever else you can to make it faster.<br />
Dxm At 4AM - The water doesn't do much, so you can take it out.  Take out the mirror too - IMO, it makes it look better without the mirror.  The Color Clip and Brightness don't do much either(due to the Color Map at the end).  You could also replace all of the moving particles with one SSC and would hardly be able to tell the difference, besides the [slight] jump in speed.<br />
Psychotic Sunset - Not that great of a preset.<br />
Melting Skies - Best preset in the pack.  Could be slightly better if the Simple's were replaced with SSC Simple's that change color on beat, but it's not too bad as it is.  The last DM could be changed some(and it doesn't need to have t in it).<br />
Square Trip - Very very repetitive.  Make it do something different.<br />
Overall: 2.0.  Not the greatest presets, but not bad for your first pack.  Hope to see more from you and it seems as though you may be able to make some nice packs if you continue to get better.  Try to figure out who made those DM's - that's kinda important.</div></div><hr />
