      I know there's a setting for line in to get AVS to react to live music, but what about the output? I'd like it to react to non-winamp music being played on my computer, and I can't find the right plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could in theory plug your line out to your line in to feed back any sounds into your sound card. However since you need to run winamp (and even have the player visible) in order to run AVS it would be a lot simpler to just play the music in AVS in the first place.<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps if you said what this "non-winamp music" is or gave us an idea of why playing it in winamp is not an option we could help more.</p>

      Maybe he wants to see some game soundtrack visualised or something, or maybe CDs being played in something other than Winamp. (afaik AVS still doesn't get data from the CD plugin)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd like to hear his actual reason rather than try to second guess it, because I have a feeling trying to get winamp to feed data to avs from an arbitrary source is probably solving the wrong problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Damn. I removed a second paragraph to that effect from my post thinking it was too wordy and pointless :p<br />
      <br />
      You are right though, better to wait and see what he really wants, rather than what he thinks he should do to get what he wants.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Most sound cards give you the option to use their own output as a recording source. Just do the same thing you'd do to visualize sound from another source (via line-in or microphone), then go into your sound card's volume settings and change the recording source from line-in or microphone to something that might be named "Mixer Out" or "Wave Out Mix".<br />
      <br />
      This is what I use, for example, to record music from my favorite computer/emulator games (usually for remixing purposes).<br />
      <br />
      (I also use this a lot to convert my IT music to WAV, because "in_bass" isn't compatible with "out_disk".)</p>
