<div class="posttext">I just did the upgrade thing to WA 5.01, and I was wondering... did anyone else do this upgrade and lose all their presets they had stored in the C:\Program Files\Winamp3\Wacs dir? <br />
<br />
I knew I shouldn't have done gone for the 'recommended' upgrade option.:weird:<br />
<br />
Of course, I know that I could have made a back-up of all those files, but that just smacks of effort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wa5 is more of a wa2 update, wa3 was just a shitty middle version that should be forgotten A.S.A.P.<br />
I don't know if you could even upgrade 3 to 5, so maybe that's just your problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, it's an option that you do when you install 5.01. The setup wiz detects version 3 and gives you the recommendation to upgrade (and move files from the WA3 dir to the WA dir) rather than leave it as a seperate install and dir. <br />
<br />
And you're absolutely right, it's just my problem, so far. But hopefully other people reading this will know what happens when you click the 'recommended' option near the end of the install from of 5.01 if you're sportin' a happy WA3 install. It doesn't necessarily do what it says it will do.<br />
<br />
In other words, don't choose upgrade. just leave your old WA3 directory seperate and manually move your presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i got the dialog, since i got winamp 3 for testing purposes, but i never clicked on 'yes'. sucks, sorry you lost your stuff. maybe this (http://news.deviantart.com/article/10941/) can help you next time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah I lost my stuff as well.  I tried doing a system restore but I couldn't get em back.  Oh well...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Interesting, but I'll leave it alone, killahbite, I plan on backing up next time. <br />
<br />
Anyways, it only sucks because I'm not clever enough with this program to duplicate anything that I've done without heavy tweaking.<br />
<br />
Upside is that I now have a really clean AVS dir.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yup it's a rather controversial feature. I know there was someone who stored his entire MP3 collection in the Winamp3 dir and then came asking where Winamp5 had put them after the upgrade (they were all deleted).</div></div><hr />
