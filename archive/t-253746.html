		Stupid question....<br />
<br />
I have 3 superscopes scripted the way I want them, except, I need them to start their scripts about .5 seconds after each other.  <br />
<br />
I had it working when I started editing the AVS, but it winamp crashed, (right after I saved) and it now starts all three 'scopes at the same time. <br />
<br />
Here is the &quot;Point&quot; section of my 'scopes, the way I had it working was all three were going up and down, but it looked like they were rotating around a central point.  <br />
<br />
d=i+v*0.2; r=t+i*$PI*4; <br />
x=cos(r)*d; <br />
y=(d*sin(t));<br />
<br />
I then included a dynamic movement set to random rotate, and a water effect and got a nice effect, that I intend to ask for help improving on once I get this bug worked out. <br />
<br />
Please forgive me for bein a newb, but, yeah....
