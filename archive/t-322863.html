      <p class="post-content"><strong>Still going huh?</strong><br />
      So I was browsing through my email history and randomly found a link to an old winamp forum post where I was flaming a noob, and I though "jeez, I wonder how those AVS forums are getting on". So I took a look and there are still people posting, how about that.<br />
      <br />
      Good on ya I guess, keep the AVS spirit alive, have a preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Welcome back!<br />
      <br />
      Did you check out v2.9? Coding has never been this easy.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, the last effect list doesn't seem to do anything since it's disabled.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi WoTL, I haven't checked out 2.9 since I don't really 'do' AVS any more. I assume it is just the changes Justin mentioned in that thread a little while ago (someone linked it from #avs). I wasn't particularily impressed to be honest, AVSTrans has provided similar and better functionality for a long time.<br />
      <br />
      The last effect list in that preset is an optional bloom.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks a bunch :)<br />
      <br />
      so what, is AVS now finally fixed to the point where it doesnt crash on EVERY preset thrown at it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">shiite, eeltrans doesnt work with 2.83<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: at least it thinks it doesn't. If PAK's preset pops up dialog asking if it should install a preprocessor, clicking OK worked for me.<br />
      it might break your computer, you've been warned, i dont take any responsibility, etc :)<br />
      <br />
      EDIT:<br />
      awesome preset, visually, just no kind of relation to the music :)<br />
      <br />
      btw what algo do you use for the random sphere coordinates?<br />
      i usually use this:<br />
      <a href="http://codepad.org/aI0Py31y" target="_blank">http://codepad.org/aI0Py31y</a> (here in Lua)<br />
      <br />
      EDIT3:<br />
      where might i find that mysterious 2.9 version?</p>

      <br />
      Got a notification about the security breach here and decided to have a look, whats up at the forums ... So yeah, here I am.<br />
      <br />
      Quitting doing presests feels like ages ago but I still have good memories.<br />
      I still DO host Hotlist on my web (updated sig!) and in case anyone wants the source, drop me a mail.<br />
      But beware ... its Delphi code. :-)<br />

      The latest release is probably not working, nullsoft probably did another encapsulation of the avs frame-handle. The hack should be easy to fix thou.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise: I'm pretty fine, but doing mostly different stuff now.<br />
      <br />
      I finished university, got my diploma in IT, working and I do have a family now ... which leaves not very much free time for beeing a geek :)<br />
      <br />
      However, I still do partys and fluorescent decoration in my home town. Here some pics of the latest I did: <a href="http://www.psykick.de/goacidia/PARTY/110115mindwarp.html" target="_blank">http://www.psykick.de/goacidia/PARTY...5mindwarp.html</a><br />
      Also trying to get better in music production - the hobby that ultimately replaced avs'ing - but time is always short and there are too many thing i'd like to do.<br />
      <br />
      Guess thats how life really is, once youre in job.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok ok, I might give it a shot and try to get it to a final and (at least for now) running version. I remeber myself using this one on partys vor vjing and it was mostly running convenient back then.<br />
      <br />
      As stated previously, once again the handle structure of avs had been changed, this requires the hack to be adjusted to parse into the correct branch of the handles-tree.<br />
      as a result of that it might only work with classic skin and an outdated version of avs (2.8something)<br />
      <br />
      So actually there is sort of a semi functional 2.3 ...<br />
      -check <a href="http://www.psytrancecamp.de/Hotlist/Files/" target="_blank">http://www.psytrancecamp.de/Hotlist/Files/</a><br />
      -install the old version (2.2)<br />
      -do at least one first run there (needed for som registry settings)<br />
      -patch the 2.3 executeable into the install folder<br />
      - ... hope for it to work.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise you can check the Data-File ... it contains the mess of files i had sitting on my pc since the project had been abandoned. There is no clear structure, massive refactoring is neede.<br />
      <br />
      So well, if i can get my hands on an old Delphi Version 7, i might clean up the mess and get it to work. I dont know whetere the later Delphi Versions are still downward compatible to ancient projects since Delphi moved from Borland to Embarcadero. I'll give it a try this evening, but dont expect anything for now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have bad news.<br />
      <br />
      Tried to install Delphi 7 on my Win7(64). Windows said it has compatibility issues, installed nevertheless. I was able to open my project file and take a look around, but compiling and running produced multiple errors of unknown cause - the compatibility issues I guess. At least I could have a look at the sources.<br />
      <br />
      Also tried Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010. To my surprise, I was able to access the project, but support for some used componets is gone. Compiling and running also produced an endless array of errors.<br />
      <br />
      Nothing that seems to be fixable quickly. :cry:<br />
      <br />
      I might try to set up a virtual machine with XP and Delphi 7 to give it a last try. Apart from that, i'm running out of good ideas.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I HAD the thought it might have been a joke but then, wtf 8 months later?<br />
      So, well, I took it seroiusly.<br />
      <br />
      After a another couple of hours I just got it all up &amp; working in virtualbox, still seems to do fine, except some adjustments to winamp shifting the config dir to the windows user space would have to be made.<br />
      <br />
      Had a look at the vvblog - seeems r4dian hasnt finidhed avs support yet, did he? The blog ended with unresolved problems.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i follow vvvv that much to be honest. grandchild and micro.d are using vvvv heavily, but that's maybe because they're one of the few artists i know that play their presets on parties.<br />
