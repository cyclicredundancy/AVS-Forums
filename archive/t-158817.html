      I finally decided to stop procrastinating and try working with AVS again and started reworking all of my presets. I decided to do something with the mouse control, and this is what I came up with. The game is pretty straightforward, keep the black lines from reaching the bottom.<br />
      <br />
      (btw...is there any easy way to only trap the first 'click' so that click+drag doesn't regiser on the buttons?)<br />

      [EDIT]Realized I forgot to turn off Enhanced Deflate in winzip. Same file, though.[/edit]</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah you can do that. Each frame, only register a mouse click if the mouse was not down on the last frame. It shouldn't be too hard to do that. Just set a variable at the end of your code to the getmousekb(3) on that frame. Then on the next frame, compare that variable to the current getmousekb(3). Very addicting game, nice work!

      <p class="post-content">You should make it FPS independant. It went way to fast, until I adjusted the framerate slider. You can also very easy that way, just set the framerate slider to 10 or something fps.</p>
