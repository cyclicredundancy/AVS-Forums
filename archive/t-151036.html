      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D stuff</strong><br />
      Ok so I'm new to this online AVS deal. I've been doing AVS for a little while now and I saw a few submission for that contest. Now I know how to do 3D stuff and I see some of you are very good at it. Now we all know graphing space curves is possible in AVS but has anybody added shading to a space curve? If so can someone direct me to a preset? If not... Uhh does anybody wanna see my shaded torus curve? No movement or anything. Just a torus curve that spins and is shaded.</p>

      <p class="post-content">question. I just downloaded some REALLY nice looking 3D presets. Are those raytraced?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If it is a DM, most likely. If it is a SSC, no (it is possible to raytrace a SSC, but it would go way to slowly.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well damn I didn't think that'd be possible with AVS... Well I've written a slow raytracer in QBASIC so does anybody have the knowledge to explain how the heck this works?</p>

      <p class="post-content">post in zip format please...not all of us have a rar prog, all of us have some tool capable of expanding zips, and under normal circumstances you don't need "higher" compression rates anyway (i've never taken a close look at rar's), since presets are so fudding small :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, rar is evil! <b>Evil</b> i tell you! :eek: :confused:<br />
      <br />
      Just use something what's popular among normal users, and like atero said even though zip isn't exactly the optimal compression format, with avs files there really is no fudding need to use any "better" formats :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">raytracing is not hard to do in avs, i can post a example<br />
      <br />
      also there is a ssc raytracing but its not as useful as dm one.</p>
