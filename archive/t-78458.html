<div class="posttext">I'm not an expert at making my own movements, but I can do some If I experiment. I can't be bothered anymore, so can someone give me the math stuff for making a movemnt that goes up. You know, EXACTLY up. In a straight line, because I think that that movement and something like a ring with mosaic effect and a blur will make it look better.<br />
<br />
Plus, WHAT THE HELL IS A RIP??<br />
<br />
I read about It, but I didn't understand it. Does it mean it's a copy or something... Info Please...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Here's One Of My Experimental AVS you can mess around with. I made it in about 20 secs<br />
<br />
it's rubbish, and I lost all my AVS so i can't send in THAT as a pack!<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">a rip is a thing that you take credit for but you didn't do<br />
like if Unconed did a dynamic movement, then one day you wanna borrow it and say that you wrote the movement</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it's a good thing the winamp.com wasn't letting me publish AVS then. I nearly published loads of AVS with movements form EL-VIS and Justin (I know, THAT bad). Thanks for the info! I'll keep it mind now, and expect my AVS' quality to go bad now...:down:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if you wanna use other ppl's movements and superscopes (anything advanced), mail them your requests of using them and then give them credit in the comment, i do that</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heh Heh, How about Blackmail? Thanks for the tip, who's the best for SuperScopes? If it's unconed, i'll kill myself, but i really don't know what his avs are like. I forgot about my new website. I just made it, and it;'s rubbish. I need some help on it.<br />

It's a cheap web site, but it's a free one. Inore the name. Don't bother wasting your time thinking who the guy is. I just use it often on the internet. Don't know why...:hang:</div></div><hr />
