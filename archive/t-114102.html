      <p class="post-content"><strong>a funny winamp 3 avs bug</strong><br />
      If this was already mentioned somewhere else please don't bug me about that because I havent read the whole forum yet :P.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway the thing is:<br />
      if you klick in the top rigt corner of the avs screen the screen goes black and you have to run avs again to get the picture back. The funny part is that I discoverd this by clicking on the close button of my 'Digital artist' preset (in the center of the cros sign) and the thing actualy closed :D. Then I tried it with other presets and the same thing happend. I called my friend to try the thing, to see if this was actually a winamp bug and it was.<br />
      <br />
      I know this is not the place to report winamp bugs, but I don't give a rats ass :P because it's realy not a big deal.<br />
      <br />
      I just HAD to share it with someone:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">LOL! I'd say this was programmed in and forgotten about, maybe they were half-way into making some sort of built-in GUI and just plain forgot. Also a bug on smaller scale is the alpha slider in the display config doesn't work in Winamp3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Lets just say that I feel slightly offended by that recommendation... especially since I bitch so much to noobs about how easy it is to search through menus and options to solve your problems.<br />
      <br />
      In the future just assume that I have gone through every menu and option looking for a solution before I complain. :)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, it matters none to me now since my winamp 3 just self destructed... AGAIN!!! :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I didn't mean to offend you, the winamp3 preferences are very badly organized. The problem could be graphics card drivers or even something as stupid as an incorrect install. One time when I was reinstalling winamp3 the default skin was all muddled up, and I've also had some problems with NSIS not extracting properly. What skin are you using?</p>
