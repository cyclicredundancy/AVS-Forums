<div class="posttext">Well I'm not sure but I think my friend JAM is starting AVS. (that's not his name of course) he remixed a few of elvis, duo, and mig's presets.<br />
<br />
They aren't that great but he asked me to post them here.  Be nice....:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, I didn't much like the original presets, so the might colour my view, but I didn't like them. It's good that he's trying though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I told him that he could join these forums and try to figure out the works here.  I'll tell him to try and create one from scratch, that's a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes he's welcomed to join the forums but please tell him not to post too many n00bish threads cause there's lots of flaming going around here.<br />
Anyway i'm glad that people are showing their interest in AVS.</div></div><hr />
