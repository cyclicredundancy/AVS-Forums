      Well I'm not sure but I think my friend JAM is starting AVS. (that's not his name of course) he remixed a few of elvis, duo, and mig's presets.<br />
      <br />
      They aren't that great but he asked me to post them here. Be nice....:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I didn't much like the original presets, so the might colour my view, but I didn't like them. It's good that he's trying though.</p>

      </blockquote>I told him that he could join these forums and try to figure out the works here. I'll tell him to try and create one from scratch, that's a good idea.

      <p class="post-content">Yes he's welcomed to join the forums but please tell him not to post too many n00bish threads cause there's lots of flaming going around here.<br />
      Anyway i'm glad that people are showing their interest in AVS.</p>
