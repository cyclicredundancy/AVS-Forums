      <p class="post-content">Read the FAQ on the main page, and learn how to code superscopes and movements, but first you will probably still just want to make some of these noob presets so you can learn about what AVS can do, and don't listen or try to understand most of the tech-heavy preset makers and their fancy math threads, and don't try to understand most of their presets, just start small.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The above is all true. The only way to get better is by experimenting. Make whatever. Try to recreate things. Just remember, this is play. Play is supposed to be fun. If you can't figure out how to do something, don't let it get you down.</p>
