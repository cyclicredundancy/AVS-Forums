<div class="posttext">I don't know how to start this topic with some cool remark or something, so I'll just say it.<br />
<br />
I quit.<br />
<br />
I just can't find any inspiration to do avs anymore. The people who made this community cool are all leaving. I don't really enjoy it anymore, so I don't see the point in going on. I'm more into photography and 3d studio max right now. But who knows what the future will bring.<br />
<br />
My last pack can be downloaded at:<br />

<br />
So I guess this is goodbye. I want to thank everybody for the great support and help they've given me over the time I did avs. I'll be hanging around these forums, but don't expect any new stuff from me.<br />
<br />
Goodbye people. I'll miss you.<br />
<br />
AND FFS, FOR ONCE, WATCH MY PACK AND GIMME SOME COMMENTS!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In 1982 he directed Fanny and Alexander; he reported that the film would be his last, and that afterwards he would focus on directing theater. Since then he has directed a number of television specials and written several additional scripts, though he does continue to work in theater <br />
<br />
I'm guessing Jan is alluding to Bergman's declaration of his departure from cinema.  &amp; I'm also assuming that this declaration was met with some dissapointment or sadness.  Of course, Jan, being the flim-hipster made this obscure reference.  I would have said something like &quot;Its not like you're Michael Jordan&quot; or &quot;Its not like you're Phish&quot;<br />
<br />
I hate to hijack this thread, but samurai#### brings up a good point.  Why are AVS artists so tempermental?  I can only think of a few AVSers who have been around longer than I &amp; are still doing it:  Horse-Fly, Yathosho, &amp; El-vis.  You think its something with the platform, or just a general characterist of all digital media?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th July 2004, 19:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I may not be that well known, but I think I've been around longer too. I started May 20th 2000 or so. I guess that makes me a long-termer anyway. And I'm not about to quit for a long time... I at least I hope so.<br />
<br />
And Tugg.. I think you're cool.. but reading on DA lately and now this made me feel I'm getting one of the few these days. :igor:<br />
<br />
And why that is.. I have a ltiile theory of my own.. <br />
When you start AVS'ing, you can do all kinds of stuff that looks great.. in your eyes... So you visit the community. There you're being cracked down, in order to learn coding and not doing the so-called n00b stuff that you've been doing and you really love. So you slowly start learning to code and create your old ideas that you've felt you could never do. When you've created such a great preset, someone else makes a great preset that totally blows you away. So you have to study on, because you want to be good. Now you should say to yourself: Hey! I don't need only that! style and looks are mofe important that that! but since there's no progress in &gt;learning&lt; how to create a good-looking color-combinations, at least not for your mind, you continue to work on your code, in which will be disappointed time after time because there is always some-one better. That gives you the feeling that you suck. Sure you make good looking stuff, but there's always that little voice telling you that you could do better. So there you are on the point that, even while creating the best presets on the planet, you still think you suck. <br />
<br />
My advice: fuck that feeling (sorry to sound harsh). Be satisfied with what you make, even if you know you can do better. What you make is what you make. No more, no less. everybody has this feeling sometime. (at least I do.) <br />
<br />
(All above is not personally @Deamon but in general)<br />
<br />
<br />
So.. you're leaving.. I'm sad right now, but goodbye. :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th July 2004, 01:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't really think i suck at avs, I love the things I make. It's just that for my feeling, I can't make my stuff right anymore. I can't get anything out of my hands. it just doesn't do it anymore. I dunno how come, but I hope someday it'll return and I make presets again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th July 2004, 03:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I think the reason that so many people stop AVSing isn't so much from the fact that there are so many great artists that make better stuff than their own. I think the reason is that AVSers (and any artist of any medium really) feel that they need to top themselves on each preset they make, which results in a lot more time spent on each preset. So despite the fact that their presets are continuing to look better and better, it's taking them a much longer time to put them together, a factor that outweighs the quality of their work in their mind and causes them to stop making presets. I think that's happening to me, actually. :) So don't expect too much (if any) AVS from me in the near future. (Although I have some other ongoing projects at DeviantArt that I am working on now and plan to complete.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think it's something to do with AVS artists thinking of AVS as being on par with writing music. You lose inspiration so you quit. But I can't talk, I'm still sposed to be working on my final pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It was lack of originality and lack of coding knowledge that did it to me.  All these new effects (like global variables and register values and color modifier) all that just slapped me in the face and I couldn't take it anymore.  If I was gonna create some decent visuals, I kinda need to learn these new effects.  Either that or produce old effects everyone's already seen.  I gave up because I realized: I'm tired of trying to understand everything, I really suck at math, and that makes me hate it....<br />
<br />
But just as Deamon said: I hope I can return someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Dragon-Dreams</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st July 2004, 11:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I quit for a number of reasons,<br />
<br />
1. Hardly anyone seemed to care much for my creations. Only so much thrill can be given by your own enjoyment of your own creations. Of which I still believed to be sub par.<br />
<br />
2. I lost all inspiration, where once I had these beautiful images in my head. I have now no inspiration for such beautiful creations.<br />
<br />
3. The new Complexity of AVS. I never had a mind for maths. And it seems these days people seem to be more impressed by mindless complexity than by beauty. People make countless threads about 'who makes the most technical AVS' but I see none like, 'who makes the most beautiful visuals'.<br />
I loved the AVS of artists like Duo, not because they were technical, but because they were incredibly lovely to watch. He was a true master.<br />
<br />
4. The lack of support for small time AVSers on the forums.<br />
I constantly asked for help, and only a handful of people took any notice when I asked for some remixes. If people told me there was nothing they could do, that would be better than simply ignoring it. This may seem selfish, but it is annoying when no one will help you out. Especially when I did my best to help others with remixes.<br />
Many thanks go to those few who were gracious enough to spend a few moments helping me. No need to mention you guys, you know who you are.<br />
<br />
it seems in this community that people tend to pay way more attention to only a handful of established AVS masters, rather than look for fresh talent at all times.<br />
Don't take me wrong, I don't mean to offend anyone. But this can be really irritating some times. ( i'm also not saying i'm fresh talent. I suck ass in my opinion. )<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this post offends people. That was certainly not my intention. I was just stating what I feel about this community and AVS in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st July 2004, 15:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well.....i never thought we'd see this day about 6 months ago.<br />
<br />
Around 6 months ago...everyone was dying for thr global vars and stuff, people said that many cool ideas would turn to reality when these stuff come into use but now it seems that people are rather running out of ideas than creating new ones:p not that i'm a very original artist myself but then again.....i never got hold of this megabuff stuff :| so i just stuck to my old presets....whether people like it or not ;)<br />
not that i dont want appreciation, it surely feels good to be famous but then it should not a competition which forces people to quit just b'coz they cant make better stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do try to follow on everthing i can, just because i don't comment on everything doesn't mean i don't check them out. Usually it's just better to shut up than say bad things about the presets. And that endless pointing out the FAQ's &amp; Tutorials doesn't seem to do any good either. Because if they already don't know about them because they were lazy enough not to check them out, it's highly unlikely that they will check them if you point them out.<br />
I mean come on, nobody is going to take you by the hand and tutor you to avs. Experiment a little! Click buttons your not suppose to click! Write stupid code that makes nosense until you figure out what does what. Use loads of effects and remove&amp;add effects to see what does what, for me that method took 5 years to learn the stuff i know today, but i eventually learned atleast something :weird:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I totally agree with what shock value said. I indeed tend to top myself on each preset, and the average time to make a good preset became much to much for me. Also the math is killing me. I suck really hard at math, and the small things I can do after a lot of practise have been done a million times before. And all this new stuff that's here like buffers and such, I don't understand a crack of it, and it somehow seems necesarry in GOOD new presets. I just don't like that.</div></div><hr />

I totally understand you dude.<br />
I can't code my way into or out of a wet paper bag. So AVS is not my cup of tea. I can't do technical. I'm an utter idiot, and I believe my AVS always showed it. Theres only so much I can do now to suceed in AVS now.<br />
So, i've decided to quit before I fall too far behind. The standards are too high and I just can't keep up.</div></div><hr />

It is difficult to make new and inspiring stuff all the time. Sometimes noobie stuff is all 'I could have done that, etc' but sometimes a break is the best way. Never say never. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh about thinks being too techinical it is not always the most techincal taht make the best presets.<br />
<br />
For years since his first pack UnConeD made some of the most techincal stuff around but (and rightly so IMHO) people said they were not the most artistic. Only in the more recnt few pack I felt that Steve acheived a level of artisticnes to his packs to attempt to match the brillant techincal quaility of the presets.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I fell that  Tuggummi has some of the most artistic preset out there but techincally lacking sometimes but who are this look sweet.<br />
<br />
It is not all about techincal stuff it is about the simple, imagineative things too.</div></div><hr />
