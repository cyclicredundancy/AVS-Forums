      <b>I am suspending myself!</b><br />
      <br />
      I may have hinted this before, but I would like to announce this to you all:<br />
      I cant make AVS presets/packs for atleast 7 months, till my 10th std exams are over. I find myself lagging behind, cant finish homework, cant study because of AVS. So I decided the other day to stop making AVS presets. I have got some presets ready for the next pack, aboot 12 presets, so I cant call it as a pack, I just have to wait to complete it.<br />
      Also I wont be coming to the forums regularly, only on Sundays if possible to just check in whats happening.<br />
      <br />
      I hope you liked my presets/packs.<br />
      <br />
      Goodbye,<br />
      Shreyas<br />

      <p class="post-content">Why on earth make a thread like this? Is it really that big of a deal? I think well notice if someone is "gone" :igor: You could've just post a preset and mention it as a side note, instead of dedicating a whole new topic for your leavage (heh, i made that up :))<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, life comes first. You made the right choice :up:</p>
