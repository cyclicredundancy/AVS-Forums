<div class="posttext">I am suspending myself!<br />
<br />
I may have hinted this before, but I would like to announce this to you all:<br />
I cant make AVS presets/packs for atleast 7 months, till my 10th std exams are over. I find myself lagging behind, cant finish homework, cant study because of AVS. So I decided the other day to stop making AVS presets. I have got some presets ready for the next pack, aboot 12 presets, so I cant call it as a pack, I just have to wait to complete it. <br />
Also I wont be coming to the forums regularly, only on Sundays if possible to just check in whats happening.<br />
<br />
I hope you liked my presets/packs.<br />
<br />
Goodbye,<br />
Shreyas<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Why on earth make a thread like this? Is it really that big of a deal? I think well notice if someone is &quot;gone&quot; :igor: You could've just post a preset and mention it as a side note, instead of dedicating a whole new topic for your leavage (heh, i made that up :))<br />
<br />
Anyway, life comes first. You made the right choice :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know how you feel.  I was in karate for five years and I also had to drop out because of school.  Now my instructor is sad because I was one of the best in the class.....<br />

And you were one of the best ones here too!  Kind of a coincidence, huh? :D</div></div><hr />
