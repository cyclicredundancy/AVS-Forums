<div class="posttext">Everyone here is aware of one member, MaTTFURY, who has been posting here recently.<br />
<br />
He has consistently been posting questions which he doesn't even understand, dragging up old topics simply to boost his postcount, and posting negative criticisms on other people's work when he hasn't shown any of his own in ages.<br />
<br />
MaTT, this is me asking you to post some presets here. Prove that you have figured out something about AVS, and are not just wasting everyone's time for your own little amusement.<br />
<br />
MaTT, I await your presets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree totally with mysterious_w here. altho i have returned here only recently i have already become irritated of him.<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">if this example (http://forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=1540400) is only half as good as his other presets, then his work really sucks...<br />
<br />
but matt, come on and prove me wrong...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">He's been banned, it's hard to post when your banned.<br />
<br />
Stupid noobs you are<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 07:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">BS. he still has his DA account. he can upload it there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 10:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">is he already perma-banned? thought you are banned for 7 days before you're banned for ever?!<br />
<br />
however i doubt that hew will post anything on da:<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">he's just as bad over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 12:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">he's just as bad in real life, i suppose ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 12:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">He isn't permbanned. My post could have given you a hint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 12:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i must have failed to notice that post. Sorry!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh well, never go to DA cause it takes years to load on my computer... And I got some killer cool cable interent too. Damn thing... It loaded faster when I was on dial-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2005, 22:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah that's strange. Although most da-pages load normaly fast on my computer (using dsl) there are some pages that need a bit extra time. Any idea why? probably there are too many accounts now (too much people browsing there at the same time)?!? perhaps less people had one in those good old &quot;dial up&quot; days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2005, 13:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">heh.....i'm still on dial up here :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2005, 14:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah.. i also know many others which still use a dial up connection for internet. i just meant that my &quot;dialup times&quot; are long gone (and maybe s-t's either...)<br />
<br />
i didn't mean it nastily...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you all hate MaTT so much why are you giving him so much attention, face it, he's a character and there's something to be said for that. Or maybe I'm just a contrarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2005, 21:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">good question... why do we pay so much atention to someone like MaTTFURY??<br />
I really don't know.:confused:<br />
perhaps because its not often that someone gets banned... or perhaps cause no one can understand why he permanently acts so dumb and childish. i really have no concrete idea.<br />
<br />
and yes pak you're a contrarian, well at least sometimes ;)</div></div><hr />
