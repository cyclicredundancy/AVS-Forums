      <p class="post-content"><strong>MaTTFURY: Prove yourself or f' off.</strong><br />
      Everyone here is aware of one member, MaTTFURY, who has been posting here recently.<br />
      <br />
      He has consistently been posting questions which he doesn't even understand, dragging up old topics simply to boost his postcount, and posting negative criticisms on other people's work when he hasn't shown any of his own in ages.<br />
      <br />
      MaTT, this is me asking you to post some presets here. Prove that you have figured out something about AVS, and are not just wasting everyone's time for your own little amusement.<br />
      <br />
      MaTT, I await your presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah that's strange. Although most da-pages load normaly fast on my computer (using dsl) there are some pages that need a bit extra time. Any idea why? probably there are too many accounts now (too much people browsing there at the same time)?!? perhaps less people had one in those good old "dial up" days?</p>

      <p class="post-content">good question... why do we pay so much atention to someone like MaTTFURY??<br />
      I really don't know.:confused:<br />
      perhaps because its not often that someone gets banned... or perhaps cause no one can understand why he permanently acts so dumb and childish. i really have no concrete idea.<br />
      <br />
      and yes pak you're a contrarian, well at least sometimes ;)</p>
