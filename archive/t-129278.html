		i woudlnt really critisise nullsoft when you're using their forums, getting their free product and spending countless hours using a piece of software that they made that you use for free. They've probably just started to update avs and are releasing as they go along.

Winamp 3's AVS is alot slower than in winamp 2x. I compared fps rates between 2.9 beta and 2.81 and fps rates were pretty much same...

AVS is never going to be fast, so if you are waiting for that then you will be a milkdropper forever :D<br />

		since i upgraded to beta2, fullscreen works occassionally only. nothing against the snapping window-size, but they should match the presets for fullscreen-resolutions and leave the option to disable snapping (maybe similiar as in photoshop, press ctrl-key while resizing). i tried editing the winamp.ini to get my desired resolution, but seems like avs 2.6 is pretty unimpressed of that. i guess i will downgrade..
