		here's a piece of my shit.<br />
<br />
in fact it's my first complex superscope with a bunch of stars around it. as i usually don't spend so much time to create scopes but movements and effects instead, i would like to get some commends on it.

		Cool. Try adding a trippy movement... a fuzzy/scattering filter works wonders on presets like these (cfr. Whacko AVS III &gt; Comatose Enlightment). Don't use the Trans / Scatter though... it's slow as hell. Use a Movement like this:<br />
x=x+(rand(100)/50-1)*.02;<br />
y=y+(rand(100)/50-1)*.02;<br />
<br />
Btw, if you make the shape parameters (z and q for your preset) jump onbeat, the preset is less static, like this:<br />
z=rand(100)/10;q=rand(100)/10;

		i'll try make it scattered....<br />
i already had it jumping onbeat but that disturbes the flowwing effect - btw it is meant to be a slowmo chillout pre., so turn the res. to 640*480 and enjoy the picture :D :D :D

		hey UnconeD, here is the scattered Version. i had to increase the grid size to make it look realy scattered, now there's no fiffrence in speed between the normal scatter and the custom one. this one might be even a bit slower...

		Well, i got out 16 fps - on a 1000 Mhz PC...<br />
it could be possible that the preset breaks all records in low framereates on slower PC's - maybe one Frame per day or so... :p <br />
to speed it up, just reduce the grid size.

		yeah, see it's that way that i create presets and try to get the maximal optical effect, so i use all my resources... <br />
<br />
If your PC is much slower, it's only logical that it can't work the same way, but as i said, when you create a preset you'll try to get max performance on <b>your</b> system. But i'll take care of this when i upload some more presets... :D
