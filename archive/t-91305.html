<div class="posttext">Disco Da Funk!  Freaky!  (this is also part of my AVS Preview Pack theme, but I thought these ones deserved their own threads.<br />
<br />
I was trying to make a tornado-like thing, but I ended up with something really freaky.  The tornado looks more like a cone, or a balloon, or something.  If you have a suggestion on how to get rid of the vertical lines and make it look more like a tornado, I'm eager to hear them.  Even if I don't fix it, I think they're still awesome presets!<br />
<br />
Please check them out, review, remix, critique, etc.  All comments are very welcome!  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heeey, no fireworks! :up:<br />
<br />
I liked the original Da Funk. It could use a few more elements though.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick+dirty mix of it. It ain't pretty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you look at the SSC close enough, you'll figure out that the vertical lines are quite impossible (Well, actually takes too much coding) to be removed.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I *think* I can help ya a bit...<br />
<br />
-If you want to make such tornado, you best bet is to take a spiral (I believe a dense one would be good), make the sides go &quot;up&quot;, and somehow point the cam to the right view...<br />
-Easiest way to do so, of course, is to use El-Vis's 3d SSC base code... just remove rotation, use base rotation for cam view, and no movement... The 3d coding, however, slows it down.<br />
-If ya want realism, try to look at a real tornado (Preferably from a educational show. Viewing a tornado in real life can be hazardous to your health.) and see the shape, and try to shape it to the same shape :p But you can always go along with a linear tornado.<br />
<br />
As for the presets....<br />
<br />
DiscoDaFunk : Newbish looking, pretty much swirling color.<br />
<br />
DiscoDaFunk Tornado : Same as DiscoDaFunk with the SSC seen, right?<br />
<br />
DiscoDaFunk Swirl : Same as DiscoDaFunk with a spiral SSC, right?<br />
<br />
Well, at most they can be a 3.5 Star-er, but I'd say they're 3 stars (Not on aesthetics, possibly)<br />
<br />
Remix?<br />
<br />
Ah, here it is.<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nic01:  great reMAX.  lol.  I'd never thought of that.<br />
<br />
You rated mine 3 stars :).  Would you say that was better than my presets in my AVS Preview Pack (that's not the thread's actual title; but that's the title in my sig)?  Is it better than the best in my AVS Preview Pack, is it better than the average preset in my preview pack?  I'm just trying to get a comparison to the rest of my presets.  <br />
<br />
--Edit: What about stuff like originality?--<br />
<br />
How about compared to my latest eye in my LOTR thread (the latest version is called Sauron's Fiery eye.3)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the remixes, guys.  <br />
<br />
Jaheckelsafar:  I didn't forget you.  Yours stayed the closest to my original &quot;Disco DaFunk&quot; theme; but I must admit when I saw those bright colors in Nic01's remix I kind of forgot about my original theme.  :)  Didn't want to leave you out twice.  <br />
<br />
Just wish I was good at DMs so I could make one entirely on my own a little different so I could put it in my AVS pack (sigh).  <br />
<br />
I like the remixes a lot!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's an official remix (it's original; written by me-entirely within my skill level) and it achieved a little bit cooler effect than my first one IMO)<br />
<br />
Please rate this one as well &amp; compare it to my first Disco DaFunk preset.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2002, 06:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Not that good of a remix, cmountford...<br />
I cam't exactly say whether the remix is better than the original or not...<br />
Still a 3-star material, in short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hey, not too shabby. I turned down the brightness abit though. I'm not really a huge fan of bright white bits in a preset.<br />
<br />
Nic01 and I have a different view on remixes. I prefer to make more subtle changes where the original preset can still be seen. I guess it's more tweaking than mixing usually. :) Nic01 just takes it in another direction all together. (kinda like the Pump Panel mix New Order's Confusion, if you're familliar (club scene in Blade)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">cmountford</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd June 2002, 23:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I'll be gone Monday through Friday...so don't think I died or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Nic01:  So, what did you think of my LOTR presets in terms of ratings?<br />
        (especially detailed stuff like originality, aesthetics, <br />
        etc.)?  <br />
<br />
        Also:  You know I have a bunch of much improved presets in my <br />
        AVS Preview Pack that I don't think you looked at (at least <br />
        you never reviewed them...and they're a lot better than the <br />
        ones you reviewed (IMO)).  At least a little less repetitious <br />
        and a few more effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I can't edit my last reply, so I had to make a new one.  BTW-Nic01:  The newest version of Sauron's eye is Sauron's Fiery eye.3<br />
<br />
I believe you reviewed one of my earlier attempts; even though the name of the one you reviewed was misleading.<br />
<br />
I know I'm doing a lot of cross-threading (putting  posts about other threads in this thread); but then again, each one is related to the other threads.<br />
<br />
Nic01:  Could you also check out some of my newer presets in my AVS preview pack?  They're in several zip files throughout the thread.  Most of them are cooler IMO than the previous ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've been tinkering with Nic01's DM in his reMAX.  I'm posting my remix to his reMAX here.  I have a question.  Is &quot;n&quot; doing anything in the DM?  <br />
<br />
Nic01:  Was the DM you put in your reMAX in any of your presets in your newest AVS pack?  If not, could I use my modified version?  Just for the heck of it?  <br />
<br />
Also, any analysis of this for improvements &amp; adding new variables would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
