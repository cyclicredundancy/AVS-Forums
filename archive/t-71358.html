			<strong>Thanx for the report</strong><br />
		
		

		Thanks for the report Antzas.<br />
<br />
I'll be as aware as possible about the &quot;virus&quot;.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Any file you download from me, at least to MY knowledge, has no viruses, so you can trust me.<br />
<br />
I won't say something won't &quot;slip in&quot; by accident, because things can happen very rarely in transfers, but, I'm a trustworthy person and wouldn't ever put a virus into a file, so you can count me out of the list. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck in figuring this one out.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
