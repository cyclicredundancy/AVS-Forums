      <p class="post-content"><strong>Looking for a visualization with...</strong><br />
      Sorry if this request is asked often, but I haven't been able to find anything about it through the Search feature.<br />
      <br />
      I'm looking for a visualization or a plug-in that will display file information about the currently-playing song. The tag info, the file path and name, whatever. Anything would be helpful.<br />
      <br />
      The catch is that it has to display _large_ and has to display for the duration of the song. It's for a computer in my office that is used as a music server. Everyone is roughly ten feet away from the machine. It would be great to be able to look over at the machine and see the name of the song playing in text large enough to read from where we're at.<br />
      <br />
      I had a plug-in on my old pc that did it, but can't remember what it was called for the life of me.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone know of any?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I know that AVS isn't what you want, which is what the forum is for. You should ask this question in the general plugins forum. (not to subtle hint to mods)<br />
      <br />
      Off-hand I can't think of anything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ah, I didn't know that AVS couldn't accomplish that. I'll post about it in the Plugin forum. Thanks.<br />
