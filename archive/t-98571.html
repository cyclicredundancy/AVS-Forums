		You are definitely getting better.  Keep tinkering around in AVS.<br />
<br />
:up: I like it :up:  It kind of reminds me of a huge explosion in space (supernova possibly), but in another way it reminds me of warp speed (thus the name warp10).  Or you could possibly look at as the energy output from warp drive (the colorful stuff is either the fuel being burned or what's left afterwards...maybe a bit too much imagination there-but you get the idea).  Whatever it is, it's quite nice.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to be able to rotate the entire scene &amp; reverse gradually.  Just mess around with it &amp; see what you can come up with.  Not that anything is wrong with it---just different variations of your idea.<br />
<br />
Think!  Think!  Think!  I cannot say how much it benefits you of thinking of new ideas &amp; ways of doing things.  Try making different presets, instead of similar ones.  I've had a lot of trouble making presets that are different from each other.  I do so many remixes &amp; stuff that I have more similarity than I have different.  Branch out!  Think about what other types of presets you can make.  Use the various aspects of AVS in ways you've never tried before.  It's hard---trust me!  But it will pay off.<br />
<br />
Again---a quite nice preset! :)

		It'd be cool the get the stars to do something to the beat. Messed around a bit and this came out. It's not the prettiest, but I gotta get to work. :( It does something thet looks whacked with quick beats.
