      <p class="post-content"><strong>Evil point dot</strong><br />
      I'm putting dots on the screen all randomly as random does. The thing is I don't know why the dot in the middle is there. I want to get rid of it and I can't seem to do it (at least with my caveman antics) using skip.:confused:<br />
      <br />
      All I know about this method of drawing with a superscope is what I've pulled from these forums and reverse engineered from other peoples presets (and I only say "reverse engineered" to be self important or at least sound like I'm in the know). Help a guy out, please.<br />
      <br />
      Here's the superscope with a grey background to show off the ugly evil dot in the middle of the screen. (It is supposed to be restricted to that letterbox shape .)</p>

      <p class="post-content">you based you p at 0 (p=-1 in frame and p=p+1 as the first line in the frame) but you had no equal(p,0) in your equations for x or y. so i changed n to 9 and lowered all those index numbers in the equation for x/y by 1.<br />
      I also simplified your randomization code and changed your color coding so that there is not 1 dot black and the rest white anymore :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">if you just want to put random dots, why not just use<br />
      <br />
      Init:<br />
      n=1<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      xt=rand(2000)-1000;<br />
      yt=rand(2000)-1000;<br />
      <br />
      Point:<br />
      x=xt*0.001;<br />
      y=yt*0.001<br />
      <br />
      ?<br />
      <br />
      you can then do what ever you want to the color</p>

      <p class="post-content">And if you want to use more than 7 or 8 dots (say 100 or more) you should better use arrays, in other words, loop() and [g]megabuf() !<br />
      (you can find examples in my presets "Irradiation" or "Maelstrom", and "Poursuite" on my web site - see link below).</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. set n to 9 (you have only 9 random points)<br />
      2. write p=0 instead of p=-1 in the frame textfield<br />
      3. delete the line with the skip function<br />
      <br />
      P.S:<br />
      When the 'per point' commands are executed at first time after the 'per frame' textfield your variable p has the value -1. After that it's incremented to 0 and you get the point (0.02, 0) which is the 'evil point' in the middle.</p>
