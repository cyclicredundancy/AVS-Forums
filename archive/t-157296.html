<div class="posttext">I've searched the forums and FAQ for this problem and found nothing. So please, if it was already discussed, don't diss me. I'm just a n00b. :D <br />
<br />
Ok well when I had the winamp5 beta 1 &amp; 2 the AVS worked just fine. But now I downloaded RC8 and like, it works but it looks SO ugly. I've tried switching the avs dll and it won't help. It just looks... pixelized. Hard to explain. As if I didn't have my geforce. :igor: <br />
<br />
Can someone please tell me how to fix it asap? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">chances are your pixel doubling is turned on. <br />
<br />
Look in the settings/display in avs, and uncheck it.<br />
<br />
and sorry, but your geforce wont save you here, avs is strictly software powered. Except for the overlay mode.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I want to display visualisations on a large screen for party, and am finding that things look very pixelised on full screen mode. Double pixeling is already off in my settings... is there anything else I can do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Are you already using overlay mode?<br />
<br />
Don't go for resolutions any higher than 640x480, or maybe 800x600 if you manually chose fast presets.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to set the performance slider set to maximum (left)<br />
<br />
Also, enable &quot;wait for retrace&quot; for a better quality, but at the cost of some speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that at a party people will be paying so much attention to it (especially if there's booze involved ;)), it's just something that runs at the background, don't sweat about it. More important is that you don't use too high resolution so that AVS will run choppy, also most presets are designed for &quot;low&quot; resolutions so using a high one might just &quot;break&quot; the preset (not working correctly if at all)</div></div><hr />
