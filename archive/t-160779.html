      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Overlay Problems</strong><br />
      im having a problem getting the Overlay to initialize on my system here at work. im running a Win2000 workstation with a p4 1.5ghz 256m with a geforce 2 mx200. ive searched all the posts and ive found a few posts regarding thing but with no real answers. when i initialize the overlay.. the color box. (which should change to a preview of the AVS does not) And of course, the desktop does not change to the AVS either, YES i have set desktop checkmarked.. and YES ive updated to the most recent release drivers NVIDIA has for the card AND YES ive checked and tried all the different overlay options in the display properties for my card to no avail. can ANYONE give me an answer, the only thing i can figure is that its gotta be a win2k thing??</p>

      <p class="post-content">not sure about win2k, but in win2k3 one has to activate hardware acceleration for the gfx card manually (control panel&gt;display&gt;troubleshoot).</p>

      <p class="post-content">well theres no option like that in win2k... i checked a different machine with a totally different config (better) and i get the same thing.. so i think its definately a windows problem.. anything else?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe you are doing it wrong. Can you give us an exact description of what you are doing. Your post gives me the feeling that you are just checking the "Use Overlay Mode" box and not pressing the "Go" button</p>

      <p class="post-content">hungryskull: there are 2 'overlay modes' in AVS...<br />
      <br />
      - Regular overlay mode, useful for running AVS as desktop wallpaper.<br />
      <br />
      - Fullscreen overlay mode, just an alternative and quicker way of having fullscreen AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Obviously he's trying the first. I know there are some issues with overlay mode at higher resolutions: try lowering your desktop resolution and then try it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">UnConeD is right.. im working on the first.. the fullscreen doesnt work alltogether.. but thats a discussion for another day.. here is exactly what im doing:<br />
      <br />
      starting a song in winamp.<br />
      opening the AVS<br />
      going to the config<br />
      going to the display settings.<br />
      checkmarking overlay mode<br />
      checkmarking display as backround.<br />
      <br />
      NADA<br />
      <br />
      now i HAVE lowered the res.. and tried everything inbetween.. and still to no avail.</p>

      <br />
      I know that there are two overlay modes. I just accidentally misread his post.<br />

      <p class="post-content">you probably tried it but you didnt mention checking the set desktop to color. And i think someone said somewere that choseing the worong color can bother it. but the defoult one should work so if you havent chaneged it thats not it:S.</p>

      <p class="post-content">maybe check the options in the winamp.ini, probably multiple entries or something like that.<br />
      your desired setting should be <b>cfg_bkgnd_render=3</b>, correct me if i'm wrong</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not able to get overlay to show up at all on a WinXP Pro computer. I think the graphics card on this computer is on-board the motherboard. The overlay preview does not show up over the colour box.<br />
