      <b>Heeeeey Everyone,</b><br />
      I was wandering cause i am making these <i>AVS</i> for winamp and those are pretty cool. (most of them look far better then those of <u>Justin or Lone</u>. So i was thinking is there any way i could show my AVS and put it up the server or something.? :cool:<br />
      <br />
      See ya laterrzz.<br />
      <br />
      Ow and if :winamp: would ask to charge us for Winamp3...well hehe i would get it Illigal cause Winamp rules but only as a free program.:P<br />
      <br />
      Windows Media player works fine also.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Or as an alternative, you could try explaining the importance of a clear message. Show how punctuation improves the reading, and encourage then to post more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Right.. if I wasn't so tired, maybe I might've done that [minus the posting more part] (although I have a sneaking suspicion it wouldn't make any difference)....<br />
      <br />
      and <i>then</i> told a mod to move it. :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Heh. It just blows my mind though--I don't get it.. I mean, do people just not read the descriptions for the various forums here? Man. Craziness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, he did ask a valid question. Essentially "How can I get published?" The rest of the message is, well, right out of left field.<br />
      <br />
      To get your work out, post a message in the appropriate sub-forum, or submit it at winamp.com</p>

      <p class="post-content">Spend 5 minutes browsing the Skins and/or Plug-ins section. Hint: it's near the top of the page.<br />

      Sometimes I get the idea that 50% of all users browse the web with some heavy-duty myopia glasses on.</p>
