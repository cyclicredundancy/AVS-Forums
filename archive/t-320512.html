      <p class="post-content"><strong>Question - visualization that displays file name</strong><br />
      Hi guys, sorry if I am not posting this in the right place but I just couldn´t find it.<br />
      <br />
      <b>I was wondering if any of you guys know, or have shared, a visualization that will display just the file name in a big font size with a scrolling effect or something similar.</b><br />
      <br />
      I use winamp all the time in the school I work for but I was reading how to modify those milk drop presets and it is way out of my league.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks a lot and sorry once again for posting this in the wrong place.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">An AVS preset.<br />
      Download it and unzip it to (by default) c:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs\<br />
      <br />
      Have fun with it!<br />
      <br />
      I couldn't get you the exact filename though, this preset takes the text that's in your playlist.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, I was going to suggest that howeverrrrrrrrrrrrr, if the song name is wider than the rendered area then you'll only get what fits and then that will get scrolled. (which will look confusing, this would be more obvious with a big font.)<br />
      So personally I believe the avs option is a no go.<br />
      <br />
      Shouldn't be too hard make a plugin (or crappy VB app) that does this, if there isn't already one floating about. I'm not aware of any, since I have no personal use for it. (I assume you've looked in the plugin and vis section of the winamp site though.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you, guys! winter-break -shouthern hemisphere- is over now and I´ve just got back to the classroom. I´ll give it a try this weekend and let you know how it went (hope the kids like it too).<br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Guys! I´ve finally found a workaround solution. I use the avs present and I do not run it on fullscreen mode but I use a screen amplifier so have HUGE letters on the top plus the regular display on the bottom....the kids love it.<br />

      Thanks again!<br />
