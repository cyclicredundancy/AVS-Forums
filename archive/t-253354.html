      OKay!<br />
      <br />
      Here's an IDEA. You know that guy, Martial Law? He's from Tekken.<br />
      There should be a preset with him, a lot like the drinking Santaclause preset, only Law should do his Broken Arrow technique, his frog technique (where he jumps to his back and then hops up again), and all his backflip techniques. Also, he does this thing where he like backs up and drops his guard. That's cool... That would be such an awesome preset. I'm gonna try to make it, but I have never made a preset, so....<br />

      Umm yeah i think i'll save the pros sometime in answering your wish. That many moves is very costly in avs terms because of the amount of programming it takes to even render one arm of that dancing santa. If youd like try a synchronised scope with a texer sprite of law and have each texer do a part of each of the moves. that might get you what you want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well. Here's what I'm thinking.... Just do draw his head out, then put a body on the head, and have the body spin around the head, and whenever the body gets close to the "ground", the legs extend a little bit, to make it look like a landing. Then his hands could do the broken arrow movement. That's a pretty simple move. You know what it looks like?<br />
      It's like... he puts out both of his hands (wrist up), waits for a half second, then he twists his wrists to wrist down. hehe<br />
      If you think about it... it would still be a really great plugin without the frog move. I don't know if this would be as tough? Just the flips and the broken arrow?</p>
