<br />
This is a new advanced skin I have designed and is being coded now.<br />
<br />
I want this to be the first skin to be released with a custom AVS,  to be released  at the same time together called Venom AVS<br />
<br />
I will give the best avs preset that is posted here $40.  and the rest will be shipped with the One that wins.  Tell me what you think. Try to incorporate electricy or skin colors and graphics into it.  Thanks!!  prize money could go up depending on the responce to this.<br />

im not sure if i quite understand what you are getting at though, are you actually going to use more than one preset, or just the one that wins.</div></div><hr />

From what I can gather from the other thread, I think he's looking for us to be the ones to make the electricity animated... (correct me if I'm wrong QH)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no.  that is not the avs screen.  then the &quot;custom&quot; avs would be pointless.  what QH wants is an AVS preset, preferably electric-themed that looks somewhat like the skin</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hi,<br />
<br />
the electricity is going to be animated by me, and it is activated by sound.  You guys just have to make your avs presets to show in the AVS's box.  I dont think the AVS's can be put in the .wal but it will be released on the same day that this skin is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So the avs window will be just like the normal avs window? Or a special shape? I guess one criteria also is FPS... or do you want something really complex? (not that i can do that, but just asking) One more question and that is, do you want it to be skin themed (with colors)?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all these questions, but im interested and i will probably try to make something atleast :)</div></div><hr />

Its the normal vis window,  fps doesnt matter, complex or not,  more thought that goes into it gets more points with me. The skin will have alot of different theme colors but to just make the avs to how you feel Venom should be portrayed is what i want.  Its a cool skin make cool AVS's<br />
<br />
they might all be in the final download,  but 1 will win!!  1 month till I stop taking AVS's</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just use x(n+1)=x(n)+(rand(3)-1) as I pass down the shaft.<br />
<br />
A lightning can be considered a fractal shape (up to the level of the air molecules that are being ionised) so the spectrum after sampling would contain an amplitude for every frequency (due to near-infinite aliasing), unlike regular music which is concentrated in the lower frequencies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya I think I can link a installer program from a window that pops up when the skin is first installed.  That would be really neat.  Then who ever makes a vis and sends it in to this contest will be in there.  They will be rated from 1 to whatever the count of final AVS's.  No AVS's entered as of Yet here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry quad, but everytime i tried to do a preset for your skin i ended up making such a good preset that i wanted to keep it for myself :D Besides i guess you can't use any external files/effects in the preset, am i right? You know Picture's, APE's etc. Anyway sorry man, but im keeping these myself :blah: :p</div></div><hr />

Come on Tug,  let us have 1 of them at least.  You can add graphics like small bmps I will put them in a folder.  There will be a installer with this pack that will be in the Skin directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well they are actually not that good, but they use APE's which i doubt you could or would include within the skin... I might try again to make a venom preset after i get my pack out, which is this wednesday, which is... tomorrow! (wow....)</div></div><hr />

1st place: $50<br />
2nd place: $25<br />

<div class="posttext">You said you can do support for small pictures, but you still didn't say anything about APE's, I made a nice preset, but it uses the colormap ape, I'll post it in a day or two, I'm still working on the background a little bit, with or without colormap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes, I do have the newest Colormap, but I worked on it over the last day and made it now so that it uses Channel Shift instead of Color Map. I don't know if there is a newer version of Colormap or not, but I included the one I have with it. I might try to change the background around a little bit, because I don't like the way it turned out exactly, but it's good enough for now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think you are just jealous of my sexyness, or it could be that my ego was overinflated by my small moment of feeling like I am the best! <br />
Could we get an estimate of when the skin will be finished?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">SKIN is about 60%  and the coder is back on it now trying to get it done. I will have a link when the skin  first opens to the Venom AVS.  Can some help me with the zipping part,  making it a Exe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ever heard of the free installer NSIS (by Nullsoft ofcourse). May be an option, and I know how to use it.<br />
<br />
NSIS generates a single .exe-file, no other files. And there aren't any files needed on the system to use the installer.</div></div><hr />
