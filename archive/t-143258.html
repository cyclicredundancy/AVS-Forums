<br />
If yes, where in the hell can you find direct link to them, as i suppose you cant really link them here?<br />
<br />
sorry if it s illegal to ask this, I have no clue if it can be done or not.<br />
<br />
thanx all

		Not that I know of.  It CAN be done, although it might be slow, especially if it is fullscreen.

		more importantly...why on earth would you want to?  there's absolutely no reason to make presets out of live news feeds; especially since you can't exactly distribute them (in case you haven't noticed not all of us can actually get a live video stream that looks any good).  And I need not mention that watching television is what televisions are for (or do I?)

		i remember that AOL had commercials that used avs, i think.  i am not too sure.  But i do remember that someone used avs on tv before.  Not exactly a live stream, but  it is as close as avs got to tv

		I could imagine that it is used to create short video sequences but a live stream would be unusual, the only usefull application would be on music television bot they got video clips instead.<br />
<br />
Anyway, would be kinda nice to have one hour per week with a VJ on MTV showing international AVS presets on MTV ...droool...<br />

		Oh, I dont want a fullscreen channel, just a lill stream, preferably with great sound quality, that would be great, mostly to hear english and keep my ears used to it (as i don't live in an english speaking country anymore and english isn't my mother tongue) but with some kind of picture its always a bit better than just radio =D, and news channel are talking all the time, better than music with is uterly hard to understand for a foreigner (movie channels would be even better but i doubt it will really be legal)<br />
<br />
and atero, if i had the nessecary equipment to watch TV, i would, but I won't buy a satelite package just for some months, and then going back to UK =)

		there used to be a show on german music-channel viva2 called <i>2step</i>. the show featured musicians or djs to play music for an hour. this was usually accompanied by a vj. mostly they used professional vj software of course, but i remember one show (think it was with gus gus) were they simply played some avs presets.

		i mentioned this in other thread some time ago, but i'll say it here again: every year here in chile there's a 'singing festival' ('festival de la canci√≥n' in spanish), and there's a big screen where lots of avs presets are shown (sadly, most presets are 'newpicks'), and the whole thing is broascasted nation-wide, and i've heard that it's broadcasted internationally too...

A friend of mine saw a preset I made (Pistaccio 2 from my 3rd pack) once on that channel. He said that that channel was non stop music with AVS instead of videos. He didn't watch it much and I don't know if that exists now, probably does. I didn't get an email tho :).

		There have a a few reprts of ppl using AVS (and other visualizations) on TV and stuff.<br />
<br />
I have some of my MilKDrop stuff on show in the uk 24hours a day here in the UK. Some sky channel 686 I think. So stuff does get out there. Actually with the version coming out they are in need of a upgrade when the beta bugs have been ironed out.<br />
<br />
Also got asked about some film &amp; tv work too for FOX in the US but nothing came of it. Made for pre-recorded stuff in After Effects in teh end. :(<br />
<br />
All in all there is probably a lot of AVS (and other visualizations) being used on TV a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
I would be nice if these TV stations where to ask though for premission to use though. :);)

		Avs was used as &quot;background&quot; in a Croatian music festival (qualifiers for Eurosong). There was Tonic's stuff, I think also Nemo's, Yathosho's SKupers's and some other stuff. Most of them were modified (not much, just changed the color).

		Actually I think this person was just confusing AVS with Winamp's regular video abilities, and was looking for a video-stream of the mentioned channels.<br />
<br />
Isn't it obvious from the original post?
