<div class="posttext">Is there some TVs broadcasted realtime by AVS? Especialyl CNN and/or FOX (..i wouldnt mind HBO...hehe j/k)<br />
<br />
If yes, where in the hell can you find direct link to them, as i suppose you cant really link them here?<br />
<br />
sorry if it s illegal to ask this, I have no clue if it can be done or not.<br />
<br />
thanx all</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not that I know of.  It CAN be done, although it might be slow, especially if it is fullscreen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">more importantly...why on earth would you want to?  there's absolutely no reason to make presets out of live news feeds; especially since you can't exactly distribute them (in case you haven't noticed not all of us can actually get a live video stream that looks any good).  And I need not mention that watching television is what televisions are for (or do I?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i remember that AOL had commercials that used avs, i think.  i am not too sure.  But i do remember that someone used avs on tv before.  Not exactly a live stream, but  it is as close as avs got to tv</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I could imagine that it is used to create short video sequences but a live stream would be unusual, the only usefull application would be on music television bot they got video clips instead.<br />
<br />
Anyway, would be kinda nice to have one hour per week with a VJ on MTV showing international AVS presets on MTV ...droool...<br />
:D :D :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like the idea of AVS on television. Maybe I should getting maybe half an hour of television time in the art program of my city's local tv channel ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh, I dont want a fullscreen channel, just a lill stream, preferably with great sound quality, that would be great, mostly to hear english and keep my ears used to it (as i don't live in an english speaking country anymore and english isn't my mother tongue) but with some kind of picture its always a bit better than just radio =D, and news channel are talking all the time, better than music with is uterly hard to understand for a foreigner (movie channels would be even better but i doubt it will really be legal)<br />
<br />
and atero, if i had the nessecary equipment to watch TV, i would, but I won't buy a satelite package just for some months, and then going back to UK =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">there used to be a show on german music-channel viva2 called 2step. the show featured musicians or djs to play music for an hour. this was usually accompanied by a vj. mostly they used professional vj software of course, but i remember one show (think it was with gus gus) were they simply played some avs presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i mentioned this in other thread some time ago, but i'll say it here again: every year here in chile there's a 'singing festival' ('festival de la canci√≥n' in spanish), and there's a big screen where lots of avs presets are shown (sadly, most presets are 'newpicks'), and the whole thing is broascasted nation-wide, and i've heard that it's broadcasted internationally too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A friend of mine saw a preset I made (Pistaccio 2 from my 3rd pack) once on that channel. He said that that channel was non stop music with AVS instead of videos. He didn't watch it much and I don't know if that exists now, probably does. I didn't get an email tho :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There have a a few reprts of ppl using AVS (and other visualizations) on TV and stuff.<br />
<br />
I have some of my MilKDrop stuff on show in the uk 24hours a day here in the UK. Some sky channel 686 I think. So stuff does get out there. Actually with the version coming out they are in need of a upgrade when the beta bugs have been ironed out.<br />
<br />
Also got asked about some film &amp; tv work too for FOX in the US but nothing came of it. Made for pre-recorded stuff in After Effects in teh end. :(<br />
<br />
All in all there is probably a lot of AVS (and other visualizations) being used on TV a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
I would be nice if these TV stations where to ask though for premission to use though. :);)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Avs was used as &quot;background&quot; in a Croatian music festival (qualifiers for Eurosong). There was Tonic's stuff, I think also Nemo's, Yathosho's SKupers's and some other stuff. Most of them were modified (not much, just changed the color).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually I think this person was just confusing AVS with Winamp's regular video abilities, and was looking for a video-stream of the mentioned channels.<br />
<br />
Isn't it obvious from the original post?</div></div><hr />
