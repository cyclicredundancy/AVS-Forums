		:( <br />
I have a 4 star rating for my avs pack, but still i only have like 650 dl's. And then i see these packs that have a 2.5 star rating with 3000 dl's. You can change all this injustice by downloading my wonderfull package for your own pleasure, and comment about it on this thread. Check out Energy of Sound by p3Etu aka Peetu Coppola. Here's the link:<br />

		Damn! Your pack is awesome! Is this your first release? There isn't a weak preset in the bunch! It's very hard to say which ones I like the most, but Oddballz and nu orda were so original that I would have to say it was them. Everyone should download this pack and review it. Maybe we can get him some more downloads.<br />
<br />
A couple of pointers for next time: 1. Make the pictures that advertise for your pack more interesting. I download about 5-10 new packs each week and I passed yours up (to my misfortune) because it didn't strike me. 2. Try to establish brand name recognition. Notice how El-Vis names his packs El-Vis9 or El-Vis7? People are more likely to download a pack with a name that they recognize (even if it is a not so good artist) than a pack with an unfamiliar name. You also had the misfortune of coming out about the same time as Tonic. Thats a damn shame because Tonic always sucks up the downloads. Not really any way you can avoid that though. 3. Always comment on yourself. Of course, don't try to play it off like you aren't the author, but give yourself the 5 stars and don't be scared to say what you did well.  More people download a pack with a review than a pack with nothing. Even if it is the review from the author himself.  <br />
<br />
Well, thats about all I have to say. I wish you better luck next time and I'll be watching out for you for the next pack. I'll definatly download it next time and give you a prompt review.

		More acclaim/ accolade/ recognition/ kudos/ congratulations/ mana from here, on producing a thoroughly decent, nicely original, pretty well designed pack of presets.:up: <br />
<br />
And also the generosity of allowing users to change the colourschemes themselves without feeling like they are about to get prosecuted for damaging coprighted work or something!:)
