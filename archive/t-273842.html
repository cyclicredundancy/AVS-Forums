      Is there any difference between atan(a/b) and atan2(a,b)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think it's faster because it's implemented so it doesn't have to translate the 'a/b' from avs-code to "computer-code" anymore.<br />
      but the difference will be hardly noticeable if you don't use it in the pixelbox with, say, n=5000 so it'll be executed 5000 times per frame.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, so It's just a bit faster then?<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I just tested it and I got 120+-5 fps for atan and only 90+-5 fps for atan2.<br />
      <br />
      ???<br />
      <br />
      Why would there be an atan2 function then? Try it on your PC. Maybe it varies between processors, or somthin. Use this preset. Just change the atan func. to atan2.</p>

      <p class="post-content">it seems you're right... strange.<br />
      <br />
      but now i remember that in pak-9's <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/" target="_blank">programming tutorial</a> he says that atan2 comes with some additional features like avoiding division by zero and some wrapping around the "ends" of a circle [you know, between r=0 and r=2*$PI]<br />
      /looks into the guide<br />
      hm can't find it now, maybe he told me on irc one time, i don't know.<br />
      when i use atan instead of atan2 in a movement there are some glitches to be found but they really are minor. and there's a small dot in the middle of the screen. plus it's slightly slower than atan2.<br />
      so i think it might actually be sometimes faster to use atan(a/b) than atan2(a,b) in an ssc but i'll stick to atan2 in movements.<br />
      <br />
      but have a look [it's all in the movement]:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I see what you mean. The edges look so much smoother in atan2, and there is no dot in the middle. I did get about 3 fps faster in atan2 also.</p>

      <p class="post-content">atan2 returns the correct angle that the vector (a,b) makes with the x-axis....atan(b/a) returns, well just that.<br />
      like atan((-3)/4) and atan(4/(-3)) will be the same but atan2 wont be.</p>

      <p class="post-content">atan((-3)/4) and atan(4/(-3)) <i>are</i> different. The thing is, atan(4/-3) and atan2(4,-3) are not the same. I found something in an AVS preset. Anyone wanna process it and explain?</p>
