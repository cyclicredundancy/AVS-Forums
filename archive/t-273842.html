<div class="posttext">Is there any difference between atan(a/b) and atan2(a,b)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think it's faster because it's implemented so it doesn't have to translate the 'a/b' from avs-code to &quot;computer-code&quot; anymore.<br />
but the difference will be hardly noticeable if you don't use it in the pixelbox with, say, n=5000 so it'll be executed 5000 times per frame.<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, so It's just a bit faster then?<br />
<br />
Edit: I just tested it and I got 120+-5 fps for atan and only 90+-5 fps for atan2.<br />
<br />
???<br />
<br />
Why would there be an atan2 function then? Try it on your PC. Maybe it varies between processors, or somthin. Use this preset. Just change the atan func. to atan2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it seems you're right... strange.<br />
<br />
but now i remember that in pak-9's programming tutorial (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/) he says that atan2 comes with some additional features like avoiding division by zero and some wrapping around the &quot;ends&quot; of a circle [you know, between r=0 and r=2*$PI]<br />
/looks into the guide<br />
hm can't find it now, maybe he told me on irc one time, i don't know.<br />
when i use atan instead of atan2 in a movement there are some glitches to be found but they really are minor. and there's a small dot in the middle of the screen. plus it's slightly slower than atan2.<br />
so i think it might actually be sometimes faster to use atan(a/b) than atan2(a,b) in an ssc but i'll stick to atan2 in movements.<br />
<br />
but have a look [it's all in the movement]:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I see what you mean. The edges look so much smoother in atan2, and there is no dot in the middle. I did get about 3 fps faster in atan2 also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">atan2 returns the correct angle that the vector (a,b) makes with the x-axis....atan(b/a) returns, well just that.<br />
like atan((-3)/4) and atan(4/(-3)) will be the same but atan2 wont be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th July 2007, 17:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">atan((-3)/4) and atan(4/(-3)) are different. The thing is, atan(4/-3) and atan2(4,-3) are not the same. I found something in an AVS preset. Anyone wanna process it and explain?</div></div><hr />
