      <p class="post-content"><strong>Help me find an old AVS visual effect</strong><br />
      There was one preset packaged with some 2.x version that I<br />
      lost when I upgraded my computer and didn't come with later versions.<br />
      the effect is rather boring, simple, B&amp;W/grey. It was a sphere or two (of planets/moons?) that change direction and size with the beat.. that are caged by some other effects around them. Does anyone know how.where I can find such effect? I've search and downloaded few AVS presets but had no luck finding it. To make things worse, I haven't a memory trace of what it was called..<br />
      Help greatly appreciated.<br />
      thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the response.<br />
      I've followed that thread and downloaded/installed the file. But I'm unable to see them as new installed effects (if they're supposed to!!)<br />
      <br />
      So, thwy might be what I'm looking for, but I can't verify that.<br />
      Forgive my ignorance in this matter. Your help is appreciated.<br />
      thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">In your avs directory you should have the following extra files<br />
      <br />
      3d.ape<br />
      cube.asc<br />
      sphere.asc<br />
      fyrewurx.ape<br />
      vf.ape<br />
      vf2.ape<br />
      <br />
      now if these are not here use the zip file below which will have them in it and make sure you unzip them to the avs directory<br />
      <br />
      C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\avs<br />
      <br />
      hope this is what you are after<br />
