		Wow, I haven't been here in forever.<br />
<br />
Some of you may remember me, I see alot of the same names.<br />
<br />
But, anyway... This preset was something I started quite a while back but I never could quite get it the way I wanted it, so I encourage you to take it apart as much as possible. There are alot of FPS suckers in this that you could easily get rid of. Oh and pretend that there are scopes instead of simples.<br />
<br />
Have fun!

		Sure let me just telepathically transmit that preset to my PC and get remixing. Oh wait I dont have telepathic powers....yet. You'll have to attatch it to your post like a normal person.

		Uhm, that preset of yours was a bit of a &quot;mess&quot; (loaded with effects) so i just pulled a pakkie (pak-9) and remade it :D<br />
<br />
But this was just a quickie, so it's not that good either...

		Well, it looks good but you took out the real meat, the best part was those germs running around... I know it's not too eye catching, but I can watch those things for hours.

		I was trying to expand on the life algorithm when I made it. It's so perfectly balanced.<br />
:(

		Shot down.<br />
<br />
I have to say I never really saw the appeal of the life algorithm as visualisation element. Right from the first time I saw it implemented (which I'm pretty sure was Atero) it just looks too static and slow moving. Maybe if you projected it onto some bad-ass raytraced DM it might be passable... *PAK-9 opens AVS editor*
