<div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am only new to using AVS and it would be awesome if someone could help me out.<br />
<br />
I am going to be projecting AVS onto 2 projection screens at a party I am holding and I am firstly wondering if AVS is the best program for doing this or if there are others out there that are better???<br />
<br />
Secondly is it possible to have a playlist for AVS so it rotates the Visualisation playing? it will be projecting for maybe 8 - 10 hours or longer so I need to rotate the visualisations.<br />
<br />
I will be playing MP3's at the start and in between the DJ's sets on the night so the beat recognition will work then... but is it possible to have it work with the DJ's sets? so the visualisation strobes with the beat of the DJ's music? again is there a better program for this?<br />
<br />
I have all the right hardware for the job but I wanna know if I have the right software and how to use it.<br />
<br />
Thanks heaps<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Bart<br />

<div class="posttext">Yes, I think AVS is the best for projection....To &quot;rotate&quot; a playlist, just let all the preset you want to play in your AVS/subdirs directories and go to presets then set ALL and randomly swith every x seconds....To have the DJs set for the beat, just get the sound from the DJs to your sound card ( connect to line in) and in winamp playlist go to add URL and type linein:// as location ET VOILA....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">there are a lot of other programs for Projektions like, VDMX, ARKAOS, Videodelic usw.<br />
Most of them only work on Macs and you'll have to pay(up to $400) for them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I mentioned this in a similar thread... make sure you switch to the 'standard' beat detection in AVS. The advanced locks itself once it's pretty sure of the beat, until the next song. However, when using linein://, AVS will think it's still one song and won't re-detect the beat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Also Goto Jaspers (http://home.hccnet.nl/th.v.d.gronde/) for better input and esp. output (low-latency (it reduces the minimum waveout buffer of 30ms therefore getting better beat recognition)) plug-ins. A must for any serious VJ out there who uses Winamp.<br />
<br />
Unconed maybe you should make this 'live' AVS issue part of your FAQ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well I'm not sure I can write a good covers-everything answer... I don't have multiple monitors and don't use AVS for projections :p. If someone else does, I'll gladly include it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Is it possible for someone to help me through the setup and stuff with AVS? I am only new to it and I need to get it working perfect before Friday... I can use ICQ, MSN Messenger, IRC etc.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate it if someone could spare some time to help me out...<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">There already was a walkthrough posted I believe.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple. Set the projector as primary display. Move everything to the scodary display. Turn on overlay mode, et voila. AVS, fullscreen, with the editing window open so you can mess with the presets if you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi there<br />
I am a professional Vj (in terms of this is what I do all day and night!!!). And I use AVS, along with DVD's, videos, live camera work, a couple of computer and the likes of vision mixers. I also currently project from anywhere to three or four projectors at a time, either simulateonously and seperated (in terms of content). Anyway I just wanted to say that if anyone has any question they wanted to ask about using either AVS, or projection in a live set up enviornment I would be only to honoured to answer questions, particularly if they are posted to my e-mail account at: yodhe@fluffypeople.com.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey guys..<br />
<br />
 Just wanted to point out that in the plugins section there's a new line-in plugin with some improved features. After installing it I found that Avs's beat response from a line-in signal got better..<br />
<br />
 Before that there were a few glitches in the beat-detection that I found I had to &quot;kick start&quot; by playing an mp3 for ten seconds, once it had a beat if I dropped it back into line-in it would have no problems.<br />
<br />
 Another recommendation I have is to custom-make your avs directories. Since there is no actual &quot;playlist&quot; for avs (please!), and setting up avs to randomly switch through all your presets might not be what you want, you might want to try the following.<br />
<br />
 I basically divide all my avs's into sets, a set for me usually consists of about 100 avs files. Then in the Presets/Hotkeys menu on the config screen, you can  pick among these subdirectories instead of the diretories made by the author's pimp packages. I also use the hotkeys for things like avs's announcing dj's and really cool effects I want to be able to pull out at random. <br />
<br />
 But I still want that playlist</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I figure this can go here....<br />
<br />
Is it possible to use AVS with sound out (ie: with Fruityloops or the like), and if so, how so?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
