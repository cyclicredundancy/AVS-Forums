<div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure this has been asked a bunch of times but I'm only a white belt in my search engine skill so please...<br />
<br />
where is a description of the list of options that are under Settings? i wanna know what Wait for retrace means and low priority pre-init and such<br />
<br />
And is there any form of standalnone AVS available that's like R4? I'm wanting to use this visualization for Rhapsody- R4 is too rave-ish for my taste</div></div><hr />

&quot;Wait for raytrace&quot; will wait until your monitor refreshes before redrawing rather than writing to the screen as fast as it possibly can. Most people switch it off because it results in better frame rates.<br />
<br />
Low Priority init i'm not entirely sure about, I assume it compiles the next preset to be shown in a different thread and gives it a low priority however this could be wrong.<br />
<br />
There is no standalone AVS, it is a winamp plugin an that is that I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What it actually does is writes to the buffer as fast as it can, the monitor still updates at its refresh rate (60fps normally), so that if wait for retrace is turned off the contents of the buffer can be 'half-written' when the monitor draws its frame, giving 'cuts' across the image where two halfs of two different frames have come out together.</div></div><hr />
