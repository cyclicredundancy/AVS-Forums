      <p class="post-content">The mosaic hides those awesome scopes...I'd get rid of it or make the blocks smaller.<br />
      The DM could also do with some improvements - first of all, don't leave the gridsize at 16x16! That resolution SUCKS...Use something like 40x30, especially with DMs like this that have major differences between blocks.<br />
      <br />
      And you might think about syncing your scopes up a bit - the formation as well as the color. It's pretty random right now, and random colors all over the place is REALLY ugly. If you could somehow synchronize it so that there's only small changes in each scope's color at a time, that'd be really cool<br />

      <p class="post-content">after little experimenting i removed the mosaic and did my own mosaic, which has the simplest code in the world<br />
      <br />
      and if you wonder about certain parts being very ugly, it's because i used no bilinear blend to get the pattern to stick to the screen and not just fade away<br />
      <br />
      also, i included a preset called "neon syndrome" wich is a simple preset that i like</p>

      <p class="post-content">Neon Syndrome is just great. But now Mindcube had a paintwater thing going on. If you let it go, the background becomes as unattractive mess of colours. Hmm...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like the way the music morphs the preset, and the random colors add that effect of uniqueness...Who would want to watch a preset where you know what colors are coming when? Not me...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Much better...still think u should set the DM gridsize higher.<br />
      <br />
      I think I understand why the colors in the original were kind of ugly...they were completely random, thus letting uglier shades (brownish gray, dark yellow-green, gray-blue, etc) into the mix. The new version still does that, but the new blending makes up for it. Still, you might try just shifting around the hues:<br />
      <br />
      init<br />
      pit=acos(-1)/3;<br />
      <br />
      beat<br />
      hue=rand(100)/20;<br />
      <br />
      pixel<br />
      ...<br />
      red=abs(sin(hue));<br />
      green=abs(sin(hue+pit));<br />
      blue=abs(sin(hue+pit*2));</p>
