			<strong>Australian AVS community?</strong><br />
		
		

		I know it was discussed a long time ago before I went away for a while, but has Australia made it's own AVS group yet?<br />
If we haven't I think we deserve to organise one :D .<br />
Even though i'm leaving after this last pack. I think that it would be awesome to make one. Perhaps I can jsut throw in a few presets every now and again.<br />

		i agree with tug, that the nationality is not enough to form a group. you obviously don't even know much about the other aussies. i guess in finnish-flash it's more than just nationality.

		Yesterday I was talking to a rather new AVS'er called <a href="http://mysterious-w.deviantart.com" target="_blank">Mysterious_w</a> about setting up a new group of AVS'ers. <br />
<br />
Not exactly sure what I have in mind yet, but I'm thinking about<b></b>: <br />
- Doing themed packs, and, for me, no satanistic stuff such as pentagrams and so on. <br />
- The group not being nationality-based, just people who like to do stuff TOGETHER, which means before entering new people, everyone has to agree (means not disagree in case of absence) on it. This also states that there is no need to be on a certain level first too.<br />
- Enjoying it ;)<br />

		Yathosho, i think you give us (finns) too much credit :D I don't know what it is, but finnish people have this magical ability to seek out other people from finland, in whatever circles they are spending their time in (i.e. avs) :p<br />
<br />
Also the finnish people are <b>very</b> proud of their nationality.

True, especially in a big country. I think it should be based on philosophy, and as such I propose a &quot;fat computer nerd&quot; AVS group, although it might be swamped with members.<br />
<br />
Something oriented around drugs would be cool. &quot;JunkieAVS&quot; or something. &quot;CannAVSbis&quot; perhaps, the possibilitis are endless.

		Finland has produced some very good music over the years...<br />
<br />
Impaled Nazarene<br />
Nightwish<br />
Children of Bodom<br />
And Oceans<br />
Beherit<br />
<br />
etc etc.<br />
<br />
It still falls far behind Norway in Black Metal though.

		Get yourself to a P2P program and educate yourselves.<br />
<br />
As for something being decided. I made a suggestion and I need people to approach with enthusiasm.<br />
And yes, being Australian is a well and good reason to form an AVS group.

		Hmm, thats a lot of pageviews for a group that hasn't ever released anything.<br />
<br />
Similarily off topic:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://synkronized.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://synkronized.deviantart.com</a><br />
<br />
That was a group Jheriko,Maxpudding and I started. I think we made 1 remix for one of Jheriko's packs....yea we rock :up:<br />
<br />
We possibly get the award for the most pathetic effort at an AVS group.
