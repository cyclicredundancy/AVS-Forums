		Nice for a first pack.<br />
<br />
Glad that you decided to start posting here - you'll be able to get a lot of help here.  I would say a bit more now, but I have sleep to be getting to, so I'll do a big review tomorrow.

		Hey, i have seen your plug-ins: they're cool, for a first pack!<br />
A little repetitive, but you'll soon be skilled I think ;)<br />
I might copy the formulas for the distance modifier, they're really nice!<br />
<br />
:up: good job

		Thanks for the positive comments. i know my presets are a bit repetitive and when the beat dies things get really really really repetitive. I think this is due to the fact that i left the render  the same (other than colorand for some even the color) for pretty much all of my presets and just made them different with dms.  I'm hoping to learn superscope sometime soon, so maybe things will get more visually interesting. Keep the comments coming!<br />
<br />
p.s. anyone can use my dms, if you like them please do! Just credit me somehow. Oh and just some advice... the presets look best around 13-18 fps, so adjust your avs window until you get that.

		nice pack...i agree that the presets are repetitive (not in and of themselves, but as a pack the effects get used too much).  but your sense of aesthetics is good, and your colormapping skills are excellent.  i see too many people putting in way too many chromes/color repetitions into a colormap and it starts to get ugly...but yours are good and smooth, and have that wonderful icky greasy feeling they're supposed to have (;))<br />
keep up the good work :)

		no kidding! a good comment from someone like atero makes me really happy! glad to know that my work isn't just wasting winamp.com's bandwidth. One thing about the repetitiveness... due to the way my dms work i can't use anything that doesn't wrap or it looks really crappy. Any advice on how to render things that wrap nicely  and don't just randomly disappear when they go past the mirror edge would be cool. if you've got ideas plz email me or post on this thread.
