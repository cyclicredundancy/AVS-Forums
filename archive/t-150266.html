			<strong>Avi video is clear in winamp video window but a little distorted in AVS</strong><br />
		
		

		Avi video is clear in winamp video window but a little distorted in AVS. Even if I make the resolutions the same and use the same Avi file.<br />
<br />
Also in AVS when the video is almost done playing it sometimes hangs up for a few seconds then goes to a new preset why is this?<br />
<br />
I'm using 2.7pre3

		It switches to a new preset most likely because you have &quot;cycle presets at random&quot; switched on. Nothing to do with an AVI.<br />
<br />
As for the video distortion, I think this is just something you're gonna have to put up with. :(<br />
<br />
Everyone's welcome to shoot me down though. :D

		Sometimes the .avi quits playing early and freezes, then 7 seconds later it will unfreeze and play the same clip over again, then finally switch to a new preset.

		There is another avi effect, called pixelplayer. Maybe this one is better.

		Remember vjdude that AVS if not designed for playing avi's, etc. I know you are trying to get a 100% free solution for your nightclub but somethings may not be possible to acheive 100% perfect results.

I agree, AVS is and will stay as for <u>personal enjoyment</u>, it really isn't just any good for Vj:ing...<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
1) AVS is damn slow<br />
2) Bad beat detection<br />
3) Unstable (this is a matter of what presets you view really, but usually the best looking presets are the ones that crash more often)<br />
4) Making a preset is really hard work and you need atleast 200 presets to keep the crowd entertained thorhough the whole night i guess.<br />
5) Depending on your skill to make avs presets, it can get really boring really fast, nobody really wants to see different color variations of the same preset &amp; nobody definetly wants to see water+simple+rotoblitter=dIsCoPaRTy! presets more than once.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really think you should be better off with milkdrop, since i haven't heard anyone complaining about these things with milkdrop :)

Despite the fact that you're totally wrong (:p) he requested a avi player and MD doesnt have any (neither text rendering, i think).
