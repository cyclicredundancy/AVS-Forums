<div class="posttext">ok, i don't visit this strange forum of yours much (if at all). but basically, when i am reviewing skins, i need to have the avs window open. not a problem there, but i wouldn't mind something nice to look at whilst it's open. any reccomendations (if it helps, i like elvis's stuff that comes with the standard wa2 install).</div></div><hr />

And i make what ever i like :p<br />

<div class="posttext">nobody mentioned me ;(<br />
<br />
and visbot only has one pack out, and it doesn't demonstrate any of the artists' skills.  also...their installer, like avsociety's and YATHOSO'S screws up vis_avs.dat, whether i uncheck &quot;change settings, blablabla&quot; or not, so be careful with that...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">14-year old boy atero sucks so much, he does not even publish his presets on winamp.com, i guess he fears possible bad ratings. damn, i'm lucky he won't get forum moderator (way too unmature!). deal with your complexes, don't curse on everybody who's cooler than you, nerd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, I didn't read daftcunt's reply when I came in here.<br />
<br />
That has no meaning at all in this thread and is only flaming Atero.  I would suggest editing the message so that it no longer says that.  We have enough flame wars going on already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">daftcunt: It's immature not &quot;unmature&quot; which is completely hypocritical in itself because your flame towards him was immature. If you have no purpose here other than to flame people then please leave and never come back. This forum doesn't need another pointless user causing flame wars.</div></div><hr />

People say I need reactivity in my presets :igor: this should do the trick :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am so sick of seeing these posts advertising presets and then another one after a few irritated posts from other users giving you the presets. Are people that stupid that they type a description of the thing they've made and then straight after describing it forget what their original goal was, to upload the preset.</div></div><hr />

NO, NO, NO! Why everyone recommends that pack! It's crap, it's the most shittiest piece of work i have ever done, it only has 1-3 good presets, but the rest is crap crap crap. Gaagh i hate everyone who likes the pack :mad:<br />
<br />

Download Tuggummi - Technically Incorrect (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml;?componentId=127943) Instead! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">How can you say innovation was crap?  It was... well, innovating!<br />
Technically Correct is also a good pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Innovating my ass :p<br />
Ok maybe it's not total crap (60 000 flies can't be wrong eeh?), but still i don't like how it has got way too much attention comparing to other much better packs (not talking about my own packs).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">tuggumi - that pack you pointed out is fantastic.<br />

(most of the other stuff is great and all, but tuggumi just beats you all...sorry ;))</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">daftcunt...seriously...what the hell?<br />
<br />
but as long as we're at it, don't make assumptions about people you don't know.  i don't publish on winamp cos i get errors when i try to upload, and i've got better things to do than talking to mods that aren't always on about fixing it.  and why in god's name did you sign up just to flame me about how much i &quot;flame&quot; people?  must i remind you...i've flamed TWO people in the last several MONTHS...*ahem* get a life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s....what, specifically, have i done to you?  like, ever?</div></div><hr />
