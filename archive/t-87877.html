			<strong>hey im back</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		i been away from winamp.com  for a while now, but i still been making presets. <br />
<br />
i posted them on deviantart.com and got some feedback, but i figured i would get a little more if i posted them here. <br />
<br />
so here they are, 13 presets of varying styles and skill levels.. give me some good feedback, ok?

			<strong>nice</strong><br />
		
		

		They're all awesome!  How long did those take you?  <br />
<br />
I know this isn't as much detail as you were hoping for, but I don't know what to say:  it's hard to pick favorites when they're all so good!<br />
<br />
I liked the color variations (almost like ripples) in Chemical imbalance.  lol!  Intergalactic is funny (and cool); I just saw the little guy.  Orbs is very nice for slow songs; nice colors &amp; movement<br />
<br />
Great job :up: (even though I must admit I don't remember seeing you in the forum before-it must have been when I never had time for the forums for a month or so)<br />
