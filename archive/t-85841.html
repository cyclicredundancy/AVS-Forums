      Almost finished, but I thought I should ask for a little more advice. Thanks to Jaheckelsafar for his advice on my last post. I've tried my best to improve these and added one or two more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I liked the changes you made. Adding the new code in the DDM in Ruffles really spiced it up. The remix is good if the original's a bit dull for you. The added motion to Another Acid Trip is great, unfortunately the amout of DMs and blending slows it down so much :(.<br />
      <br />
      On to the new stuff...<br />
      <br />
      I Want To Remember was just wonderful. The static blitz mix was still good, but I like the original better.<br />
      <br />
      The new mix of Anothe Acid Trip suffers the same problem. Slow on my comp :(. It looks nice though.<br />
      <br />
      You included the uninverted Starlight Circut, yay.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      edit...<br />
      <br />
      Forgot, the stars in the intro. They look great (but I still added a small moving particle).</p>

      <p class="post-content">It starts out 6 stars and ends up about 3. You could do a lot better on the last ones - the first change I'd make is increase detail and decrease brightness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Atero, but could you be a bit more specific? Which presets qualify as "the last few"? If you have any ideas, please, tell me.</p>
