      HI ! :D<br />
      <br />
      When i set my visualisation in full screen the image it's very very slow...anyone can expect the same problem and have the solution ?<br />

      My pc : Palomino 1600+ with 1go of DDR 2100 RAM and a Geforce2 TI 64mo on winxp pro.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>This is a very common problem</strong><br />
      The only real solution is to get faster &amp; faster processors...but a temporary fix is to turn on pixel doubling under Settings...Fullscreen. Just FYI: 640 by 480 is faster than 800 by 600, and so on. The smaller, the faster, but the poorer the resolution. Rendering performance should be at the max (it is slightly below it by default). BTW: 640 by 480 at 32 BPP is faster than 640 by 480 at 16 BPP. As illogical as it may seem, it's true.<br />
      <br />
      Hope that explains a little bit</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Actually...</strong><br />
      until I order and receive my "Gamester Alpha" custom Mach V from Falcon Northwest, I use Pixel Doubling on my ATI Rage Pro Turbo AGP. works great - even at high resolutions, there's no appreciable framerate loss (less than .5 FPS, in my case)!<br />
      <br />
      &lt;shamelessplug&gt;By the way, you might want to give my Transitions AVS pack a look - I have a thread with the ZIP file in it! &lt;/shamelessplug&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I wonder though...</strong><br />
      I have a Dual AMD 1.67Ghz setup w/ 512M 2100 DDR and an ATI Radeon 64DDR VIVO. And I experience the same problems. Except I think it's more a problem of the wrong settings being used to access the video card. ie using 'Software Mode' over 'Hardware T&amp;L' you get different performances with the same card. Because of the lack of optimization one mode is superior to the other.<br />
      <br />
      I'm intrested in how Winamp handles the AVS. Is it all being handled by CPU and RAM with the buffering handled by the video card, or are all the floating point calculations done on the video card? Do the AVSs use DirectX or OpenGL or something written by Nullsoft? All of these factors can effect the frame rate.<br />
      <br />
      Later on I'm gunna check my CPU load in Win2k (I'm in 98 right now). I'll let you guys know if I find anything intresting.</p>
