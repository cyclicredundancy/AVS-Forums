      <p class="post-content"><strong>seperate L &amp; R data?</strong><br />
      1) why does the new thread button not show up in mozilla?<br />
      <br />
      2) (much more importantly) is there a way to teach AVS to do math on the left audio stream and the right audio stream INDEPENDENTLY?<br />
      <br />
      I know that you can show two scopes, one left and one right, but i want them to interact. specifically i want to subtract the right side of the audio from the left, then draw a scope based on that new data alone.<br />
      <br />
      another example would be to draw a dot on screen whose placement is determined in the X coordinate by the right channel and the Y coordinate by the left channel. A perfectly mono recording would draw a diagonal line, from lower left to upper right, while a perfectly out of phase (left and right do exactly the opposite at all times) would draw a diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right.<br />
      <br />
      is this possible with AVS? If not, is there a plugin SDK that has this functionality?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">a. it does for me (Firebird .7)<br />
      b. yes. Instead of using v for your sound data, use a getosc() or getspec.<br />
      To get both the left and right oscilliscope data, you would use something like this:<br />
      <br />
      vl=getosc(i,.01,1);<br />
      vr=getosc(i,.01,2);</p>

      <p class="post-content">gratzie. after manually pasting the URL for the new topic button into my browser's address bar it magically appears now, but only within this forum, (not the nsis forum, for example)<br />
      <br />
      odd.<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>fixed. ad-blocking .css file was causing it (as per my suspicions yesterday). nothin in the href /looked/ like it would trigger a rule but something was getting set off so i made a false-positive rule to turn it back on.<br />
      <br />
      works great and thanks for the avs help.
