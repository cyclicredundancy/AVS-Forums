      Wassup All,<br />
      <br />
      Using WinAmp2.81 get the message "MMX Technology not detected, Download Non-MMX Version".<br />
      Kewl, now where do I get it?<br />
      <br />
      Well with a little bit of searching I was able to come up with a potential solution.<br />
      <br />
      So if y'all want to avoid the idiotic parables and kindergarten sarcasm from &#226;&#8364;&#339;tech-support&#226;&#8364; geeks about how substance abuse has really affected your ability to follow simple instructions I suggest you follow this link...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Your link and answer will be added to the FAQ. Oh and if you'd spend some more time here, you'd find out how annoying it is to have a frequently asked question pop-up every 3 days.<br />
      <br />
      Please clarify your views in the following thread, where I've written up a long post that explains my view on the situation.<br />

      Thanks for shrugging all our writing off as "idiotic parables and kindergarten sarcasm" as well. Maybe we need to start prefixing every post with "Actual message inside, please read!"?<br />
      <br />
      You got one thing wrong though: we're not 'tech-support geeks'. We didn't volunteer for this, we're just regular people who hang out here. The Nullsoft-people obviously don't have AVS at the top of their priority list, so don't expect any help from them.</p>
