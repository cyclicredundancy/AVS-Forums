      <p class="post-content">why not post them up here so we can get them from the forums? if they are too big you can split it into pieces or you could always upload it to somewhere like <a href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">www.deviantart.com</a> or <a href="http://www.deskmod.com," target="_blank">www.deskmod.com,</a> then you'll probably get reviews and ratings from loads of people.<br />

      <p class="post-content">all in all thats a pretty good first pack, although a few of your presets look dangerously similar to mine (basic colors - primary colours 2, fast and furious - magnetic flux 1) which is cool, great minds think alike. For the most part not to noobish. The prologue and epilogue were good for intro/outro.<br />
      <br />
      Critisms:<br />
      <br />
      1.) NEVER use dot fountain, it always sticks out like a sore thumb and, well, makes your presets look unoriginal.<br />
      2.) Try not to use text too much, it tends to work well in intros and if you use some nice scrolly effects or whatever, having it flash up looks cack.<br />
      <br />
      Advice:<br />
      1.) Keep on making them, experience is nice<br />
      2.) Concentrate on superscope and dynamic movement<br />
      3.) Download the work of others, lots of it, rip their code apart if you can<br />
      &lt;subtle hint&gt;get my packs (hyperlink at bottom of my post)&lt;/subtle hint&gt;<br />
      4.) Aim for higher fps, some of those presets where a tad slow<br />
      5.) Try to not use effect lists too much, they slow things down<br />
      6.) Download my avs packs, I cannot stress this enough, shamelessly plugging my own work is very important to me, it makes me who I am. I check my number of downloads daily, I'm just like that okay.<br />
      7.) Shamelessly plug your work and comment on other peoples work whenever you feel you can add something worthwhile.</p>

      </blockquote>woaw, woaw, woaw, it's ok to use the dot fountain, (you just have to know how to use it), el-vis did a kick-ass preset using the dot fountian, and i made a kick ass preset using the the dot grid, and those presets are like the oldest effects in the worlds<br />
      <br />
      i'm-a attach both presets so you can see

      <p class="post-content">I just hate those effects because whenever someone uses them (even in those two presets) it just kind of smacks me in the face and reeks of lameness, no offense, they just really annoy me thats all. Sorry if I was a bit harsh about it.<br />
      <br />
      I used dot fountain in one preset that I released, that preset is by far the single worst one I have ever released, and to make it even worse I had the stupidity to put it into my latest pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thanks</strong><br />
      :) Thanks for the advices. In the moment I've started to make my second AVS pack. Well today I made intro. A called this pack : "Yaz - The legend continues" (God I love this AVS titles).<br />
      <br />
      Here goes the intro:</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is concerning the first pack you posted:<br />
      <br />
      smooth and hot - I like the preset a lot, its nice and relaxing (plus im a huge fan of orange presets(i think its a sort of pyrotechnical sickness :)))<br />
      <br />
      Guys in blue - cool, especially the onbeat clears; however, the water effect usually detracts from any preset, so i would avoid using it. If you need to make the lines thicker, under the Superscope option choose 'Lines' instead of 'Dots' and add a 'Misc-&gt;set render mode' and change the line width higher<br />
      <br />
      painting mosiac - looks great until you take the mosiac off :). Try using more complex movement schemes<br />
      <br />
      Subtractiv View - nothing special, but i swear to god i saw the word 'rucksack' when it first started (wierd, huh?)(i am not accusing you of ripping or anything, i just think i need more valium :D)[edit] i figured this out, it switched songs right before i started watching it, and it "rendered" the name so it looked EXACTLY like the intro to Jaheckelsafar's Rucksack pack.(i still need drugs tho :))[/edit]<br />
      (oh yeah, subtractiv is spelled with an 'e' at the end: subtractive)<br />
      <br />
      Colors in space &amp; weird &amp; Disco circle (and others)- i like the way weird looks, but try using a little more dynamic bumps<br />
      <br />
      hot circle - nice coding :up:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Overall - I really liked the originality of the pack (i believe there were too many "kalidscope" presets (i think that may be a personal bias of my own, however)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      :) :) :) :( :(<br />
      3/5 becuase there was some geniunely good coding and orginality in there, but some of the kalidscopes are repitive and should be cut out<br />
      <br />
      Good job! (you did way better than i did on my first pack)</p>

      <p class="post-content">That second pack only had 3 presets in it... anyway i thought that the third one was pretty good, if you filter out the glitch in the dynamic movement you would have yourself a pretty good preset there.</p>
