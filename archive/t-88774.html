		Hey guys, I've just spent the last few days working on this preset getting the effect just right to suit a skin im working on with a few other guys. It's just that when the preset first loads it just displays a blank screen for about 10 seconds before it starts working. Probably a result of my dodgy equations. Can anyone tell me what im doing wrong??

		I'm just writing this reply to get your thread back near the top so someone like UnConeD will see it &amp; offer to help.  It's just been too long without any replies...so I just posted a reply so different people will notice it.  That's all.  Wish I could help :(

		Well...I don't know what your problem is, but I can help you a bit.  The 7 or so nested effect lists are not needed if they are all set at ignore/replace.  You can reduce them to at most 4, probably only 2.  There's no need to have 2 of the same dynamic movement in this case.<br />
And in your main DM, you have a reference to D and R in the per frame section.  D and R change during the point section, and are left at (I think) 1 and 1.625*pi at the end of each frame.  So you may as well put them in the per point section - the result is actually pretty cool, check it out.

		Yeh, i always use too many effects lists..I like to add/remove bits all the time since everythings just experimentation to me. I dont know what effect i'll achieve by doing something till it's done usually. But im slowly learning.
