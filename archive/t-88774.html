<div class="posttext">Hey guys, I've just spent the last few days working on this preset getting the effect just right to suit a skin im working on with a few other guys. It's just that when the preset first loads it just displays a blank screen for about 10 seconds before it starts working. Probably a result of my dodgy equations. Can anyone tell me what im doing wrong??</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm just writing this reply to get your thread back near the top so someone like UnConeD will see it &amp; offer to help.  It's just been too long without any replies...so I just posted a reply so different people will notice it.  That's all.  Wish I could help :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually, i've sorta fixed it. I just messed with the equations for the dm for a while and got it sorted. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well...I don't know what your problem is, but I can help you a bit.  The 7 or so nested effect lists are not needed if they are all set at ignore/replace.  You can reduce them to at most 4, probably only 2.  There's no need to have 2 of the same dynamic movement in this case.<br />
And in your main DM, you have a reference to D and R in the per frame section.  D and R change during the point section, and are left at (I think) 1 and 1.625*pi at the end of each frame.  So you may as well put them in the per point section - the result is actually pretty cool, check it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeh, i always use too many effects lists..I like to add/remove bits all the time since everythings just experimentation to me. I dont know what effect i'll achieve by doing something till it's done usually. But im slowly learning.</div></div><hr />
