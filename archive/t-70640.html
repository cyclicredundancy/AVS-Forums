      <p class="post-content"><strong>The First Package------"Euphoric Fireworks"</strong><br />
      As promised, I am ready to release my first set of AVS visualizations.<br />
      <br />
      What I have learned over the course of just one day with this AVS studio may amaze you, or it may not have any effect on you. :)<br />
      <br />
      In any case, check this package out.<br />
      <br />
      There are three visualizations here. The package is called "Euphoric Fireworks" because all the AVS's have fireworks in them.<br />
      <br />
      Tell me what you think!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>only that</strong><br />
      well, these presets look the same and you only give us 3 presets in your 1st pack, why dontcha just put a pack with 12 copys of the same preset, give us more and more varation</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, this preset is the first two I released with one new variation.<br />
      <br />
      I have already produced another variation, and I think it is turning out pretty good. This will be my fourth production.<br />
      <br />
      I think it prolly is best to wait till I get to about at least 10 presets before I finalize the entire project, but, I'm hoping to have a bit more variation, and more effects, however, I'm afraid I'll run out of resources! LOL.<br />
      <br />
      Okies, I'm still working!<br />
      <br />
      P.S. These three original presets WILL be included in the 10 pack when it comes out.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I'm ready.</strong><br />
      Believe it or not, I'm ready to release the first 10-pack.<br />
      <br />
      The funny part is, I didnt realize how great the "Movement" effects would be on some of these AVS's.. I think you'll especially like "Heavenly Fireworks" when it comes out, very, very shortly.<br />
      <br />
      I'll continue working on some more when I get time today.<br />
      <br />
      Peace out....<br />
