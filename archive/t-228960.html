      okay, so i think it looks like a divine inferno, but whether it does to you or doesnt is fine. i am interesed in figuring out how to ake the center less bright and the edges seem more like fire. this is my first post SO i wont ask for anyone to be gentle, but i want constructive criticism. i want suggestions if anyone has any.<br />
      <br />
      this came to be while i was tinkerng with the preset "big bang" by zamuz, and as so, all credit should go to zamuz for the work. i just made a good mistake.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well i just tweaked it a bit, and this is how it looks now. the cener is a bit dimmed, im much more happy with the particle movement, but i want them to be more fine and blended.<br />
