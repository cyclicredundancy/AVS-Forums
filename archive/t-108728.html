<br />
<div class="posttext">I was wondering if someone could list all the vars for Dynamic Movments, Movments, Superscopes, DDM etc... And explain what they do.<br />
<br />
And another question...<br />
<br />
I write presets for milkdrop *recieves a bunch of ugly stares*<br />
<br />
And I was wondering if D and R have any relation to Rad and Ang that we use.. If so what? If not then are do R and D do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- idiot</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I dunno much for I am a milkdrop loser too, in fatc,y ou bloody damn well better know who I am ;)<br />
<br />
D is distance, and r is radius.. from what i gathered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You've been here before idiot24-7. Didn't you make some AVS presets a while back?<br />
<br />
I'm sure this has been answered before. There's probably a link in the FAQ, but I'm too lazy to look. Here's a quick explanation.<br />
<br />
<br />
DM<br />
<br />
r = rads (2 pi is 360 degrees, though you probably know that already)<br />
d = distance (1 is at the corners)<br />
x = x value in (x,y) (-1 .. 1)<br />
y = y (-1 .. 1)<br />
alpha = alpha value (0 .. 1)<br />
b = beat (1 in it's a beat frame, 0 if not)<br />
<br />
x,y,r,d can be changed by specifying the source for each new point. eg. d=d*.98 makes a slow zoom.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Superscope vars (taken from the superscope screen)<br />
<br />
n = number of points on scope<br />
i = location of point on scope (0 .. 1)<br />
red = red value (0 .. 1)<br />
blue = see above<br />
green = see above<br />
w = width of the window<br />
h = height of the window<br />
x = see DM<br />
y = see above<br />
b = see above<br />
v = value for a point on the scope (gotten from the music) (either osciliscope or spectrum data)<br />
<br />
x,y,red,blue,green,n can be changed, or just set</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I did make soem AVS presets... Although they were the same old stuff thats sent to winamp.com every day, But I did.<br />
<br />
Thats why I asked for all the vars.. I wanted to try and do somthing work while... <br />
<br />
BTW Anyone heard that DJ Azirphaeli guy? I heard his music sucks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th October 2002, 16:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Never heard of him. Is his music so bad it's good (seventies porn music), or is it just bad (any other seventies music)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jaheckelsafar, you're WRONG!!!<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
d=distance, sqrt(2)=1.414... at the corners, 1 at the sides.<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Atero: nope.<br />
Actually AVS isn't very consistent in its scaling anyway. For example, (x,y) range -1...1. Which would logically dictate that d=1 lies at the sides, not corners.<br />
<br />
Yet if you use a movement:<br />
d=min(1,d);<br />
it has no effect, which means d=1 lies at the corners.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">BTW Anyone heard that DJ Azirphaeli guy? I heard his music sucks<br />
<br />
That was a stab at Zylot :) thanks his name he uses for his music..<br />
____________<br />
Edit1<br />
<br />
BTW<br />
<br />
Nobody answered my Rad/Ang question.. They are vars in MD but I dont see them in AVS I suspect they have somthing to do with D and R since from playing around I can get the same effects with certain code used in MD and AVS.<br />
____________<br />
<br />
Edit2<br />
<br />
Is there a var similar to what we use in MD called time? If you dont know if I had d=d*.83+.01*sin(time) (as he said above) It would make the zoom go forward then backward some? Is there a var or a line of code that does this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">just make an above() or below() statement<br />
it works for me<br />
(not that im that great of a coder or anything....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Indeed, haha, and how bad it is is dependant entirely on the foolish who dare listen to it ;)  I write stories better than I write music, obviously ;)<br />
<br />
Well, now I have a better understanding of r, thanx folks!<br />
Oh, idiot, just define time in per frame yerself.. t = t + (desired intervel).<br />
<br />
As for Rad and Ang...  d is sorta like rad.. but I think working with milkdrops ang in AVS will be slightly more difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oops, I forgot that polar coordinates are calculated pixel-by-pixel as opposed to rectangular coordinates, which are just 1 to -1 stretched to the window sides.<br />
<br />
R and D are polar coordinates, used commonly in trigonometry for defining angles.  R is the angle, measured in radians, and D is the distance from the origin, where 1 is at the closest sides.<br />
<br />
Time can be done simply with custom variables:<br />
frame: t=t+0.01;</div></div><hr />
