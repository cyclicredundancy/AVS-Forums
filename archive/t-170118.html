      I've finally released a pack of presets, it includes the around 10 that i've posted here before and 10 more from another pack I was workin on that nobody but me has seen before. I need people to review my pack because i'm not happy with the staff reviewer saying:<br />
      <br />
      <i>"It's ok.<br />
      The pack's ok, there is nothing groundbreaking and most presets look simple. The author has potential and should work more and pay attention to details. Worm Party is probably the best in the bunch.</i><br />
      <br />
      Sure I need work but ouch, and some presets were meant to be simple. One of the packs combined into this release was actually called "simplicity."<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Reviews are subjective by definition. If you don't want to deal with criticism, then don't publish them at Winamp.com at all. Simple as that.<br />
      <br />
      On Winamp.com's scale, 3.5 is a spot-on rating IMO.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey, 3.5 stars is a good rating, it used to be that every other "i did this the first time so check it out" packs could get 4 stars and so, but nowadays i think the reviewers are more critical which is better for the people who only download &amp; view the presets as they can trust the rating. Just like UnConeD's "Final Whack" pack didn't get 5 stars for nothing :)<br />
      <br />
      It is kinda sad though that the rating isn't valued that much nowadays, artists aren't satisfied with it, the users don't trust it... In my humble opinion the rating system should be reconstructed/revitalized somehow, even if they would just add additional star(s) to the scale, but just do it to send out a message that: "Hey, it's ok to trust the rating now."<br />
      <br />
      But forget my ranting and don't think that 3.5 stars is somehow bad :)</p>
