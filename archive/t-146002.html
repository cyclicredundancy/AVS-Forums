<div class="posttext">I finally got around to syncing them and messed around a bit and came up with this. I might make my morphing tunnel DM replace the DM or go all out on the ship and make space wars of some sort, any suggestions, comments and whatnot...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like that 'ship'....maybe you could give it some flashy rainbow colours :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice work, but it seems that sometimes the ship and the tunnel don't rotate together. I also don't like how it sometimes seems to jump from looking backwards in the tunnel to forwards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I typed a huge reply filled with tips and suggestions sometime between me pressing 'post a reply' and 'submit' the forums decided to go down.. so i went away and made put my tips into your preset.. if you don't like the aesthetic changes I don't care but I seriously recommend you rearrange your preset into a similar arrangement to mine.. you can create the exact same preset with a lot fewer effect lists and the use of only one buffer instead of two.. the result being a much greater fps.. note that my version draws more stuff than yours and gets 150% the framerate. the only code optimisation i made was a tiny little one in the starfield superscope where i replaced your if(below(something,something),0,1) with an above(something,something) which has basically the same effect, the only tiny difference being when the two somethings are equal. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dont this it is fully synched, because the camera for the dm is in the center (0,0,0) and for the space ship is somthing else ( because iz=8+z3). This would look better if the camera moved on the z axis as well as both the other axes. And your preset is unnecessarily cramped, the components could be arranged in a better way for spped and convinience.<br />
Here's a slightly improved version.(arranged properly).<br />
And along with it are my 3d ssc and dm bases (made for ssc &amp; dm synching).<br />
<br />
edit: after i posted this, I came to know jherico also had posted. Anyways..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">BTW Shreyas.. your 3D SSC base appears to be an empty preset.<br />
<br />
Synching isn't really that hard anyways, you just reverse the rotation order and negative the sines in the rotation matrices, not forgetting to use the camera in SSC by shifting all of the co-ordinates by your camera position. Although occasionally a seemingly random bug can crop up in which case it can usually be 'hacked' around if not fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's alright raz, but it's weird how the object has lighting on it and the tunnel doesn't.  Kinda makes it unrealistic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the help and suggestions peeps, i've got my full idea down now. Currently working on it. Working on the actual rotation as well. It looks jerky and repetitive after a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is an update for now until i get time to mess with the rotation a little more. I took my old starbug scopes, made them better, added my rotation. etc etc and voila.</div></div><hr />
