<br />
<div class="posttext">I need to use the boolean operator &amp;, but I can't seem to get it to work.<br />
<br />
I want to store a set of true/false conditions in one variable using a bitpattern. However, it doesn't work at all.<br />
<br />
For example, when mask=13, the following conditions should be true:<br />
<br />
mask&amp;1<br />
mask&amp;4<br />
mask&amp;8<br />
<br />
While the following should be false:<br />
<br />
mask&amp;2<br />
mask&amp;16<br />
mask&amp;32<br />
...<br />
<br />
So I started to look at what the &amp; and | operators return, and found this:<br />
<br />
All they seem to do is cast the right-hand value to unsigned integer and return that.<br />
<br />
For example, try the following scope:<br />
<br />
x=i*2-1;<br />
y=(5&amp;(i*10))*.1;<br />
<br />
This will graph the numbers 0 to 10 when 'anded' with 5. Yet you get a nice, ordered staircase, regardless of what left value is used. The same happens when you use variable instead of a constant.<br />
If you reverse the order of operators, you get a constant value (5), however, negative constants are seen as unsigned integers (2^31 - constant).<br />
The same happens to negative numbers (replace i*10 with -i*10). This is on Winamp3.<br />
<br />
Even weirder behaviour in Winamp 2: for negative numbers behaviour seems to be somewhat random.<br />
<br />
Can someone check this on other systems, I'm running W2K.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Umm...maybe explain a bit more in depth what the operators should and shouldn't be doing, and what they are and aren't doing?  Cos I have no idea what you're talking about; I doubt anyone else will either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th November 2002, 05:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">They convert the parameters to integers and then perform a bitwise &amp; or |:<br />
<br />
14 &amp; 31:<br />
<br />
14 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 01110<br />
29 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 11101<br />
<br />
ANDing the two gives:<br />
<br />
01110<br />
11101<br />
-----<br />
01100 = 8 + 4 = 12<br />
<br />
<br />
For my purposes I managed to make my own test... I just needed to see if one bit was 1 or 0. So if I want to check the 4th bit (= 8):<br />
<br />
bit 8 = bnot(below(var%16,8))<br />
<br />
First, it mods by one power higher (16), effectively discarding all the higher bits, and then it checks if the number is larger than 8.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah us MilkDrop people noticed this a bit ago.<br />
<br />
We just the &amp; operator for rounding.<br />
<br />
0&amp;3.2 = 3;<br />
0&amp;3.7 = 4;<br />
<br />
as int just rounds down.<br />
<br />
We don't use the pipe.<br />
<br />
Doesn't do a bitwise boolean operation at all. :( :confused:<br />
<br />
Confused the hell out of teh MilkDrop clone authors (Roman - Xplugin, Brian - Twisted Pixel) :);)<br />
<br />
Anyway we just blamed it on Justin and the rest of the dodgy AVS coders as Ryan stole the code.;);)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*tsk* *tsk*<br />
<br />
Stealing code that doesn't work. How pathetic. :p<br />
<br />
Does this happen in eveything? Just DM or SSC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th November 2002, 15:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So if they ever fix it, all the milkdrop presets like that will be broken? :)<br />
<br />
You can use var%(var+1) for a slower, but 'correct' rounding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th November 2002, 16:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeap they sure will. :)<br />
<br />
We have put up with far worse changes to MilkDrop and all the presest have to be changed (Went through thousands by hand :) ) - All that dodgy code. <br />
This change will be a simplist though - search and replace. Buut I don't see an update in teh near future. I have given up and am doing my own thing,</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">at least that indicates he might have actually thought about the new avs. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I tryed to use the and and or's but recognized that something else came out than expected so i totally skipped that. Now i know the fault was not caused by  my OS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hey, he isn't such an asshole after all :D<br />
<br />
one other question...will you be getting rid of that god awful window size snapping, or give it a checkbox somewhere...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th May 2003, 00:08</div></div>

<div class="posttext">WTF justin posting!?!?<br />
<br />
That's like, woah. Maybe finally we'll see some proper updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th May 2003, 01:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hopefully an update will come out soon.  I wanna see some good stuff added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th May 2003, 04:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">AFAIK that window size snapping is a consequence of them introducing new 'general purpose windows' into Winamp2's skin and having AVS use that instead of its own window...<br />
<br />
mmmm<br />
can't....resist....<br />
must....argghhhh<br />
<br />
justin: DUDE! Don't revive age-old threads :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">isnt that actually winamp 2.95 (http://www.softnews.ro/public/cat/11/1/1/11-1-1-7.shtml) fixing it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2003, 00:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, there was a leak of 2.92 and that's when Rovastar posted.  Then there was another leak, this time 2.95 with more bugfixes.  Neither is official.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Yathosho</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2003, 00:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">actually no need to answer rhetorical questions (unless it helps your stats or makes you feel important ;)). but you're right, posted it myself (http://www.deviantart.com/news.php?id=10287) before and forgot it in meanwhile.<br />
<br />
he ryan, how about subdir support. i know the request list is long, but with so many packs around this is rather essential :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd July 2003, 13:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or you switch to Hotlist / Playlister, which will manage Presets even from Subdirs. :D<br />
<br />
I know, controlers are not usefull if you are creating presets, but for viewing (even as a pure non VJ) its just perfect. Why asking for stuff you can have already?? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry Dude, was'nt able to post &quot;in time&quot; as i was forced to work far away from home and had vacation afterwards.<br />
<br />
So what, shall i shut up because i had'nt the possibillity to write this earlier??<br />
<br />
Either someone is interested in my opinion or not. If not, there's something like an ignore list i think :roll:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd July 2003, 16:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I wouldn't have minded if you hadn't replied to a bunch of old threads with nothing interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd July 2003, 08:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">What is interesting and what not always depends on the readers view.<br />
<br />
But i don't want to argue now.<br />
<br />
So just don't mind it please. None of the threads was not older than 10 days and i felt like add something to 'em, which is neither post pumping nor offensive.<br />
<br />
So just keep the peace up and if there's nothing to add we can let this thread (and the others, so i won't multi-post) die, ok?<br />
<br />
Guess you'll agree. :)</div></div><hr />
