      </blockquote>I will look into something like that. I'm not really sure how I could use it though since most of the colors are done by the color map, but maybe I could work something up using the color modifier...

      <p class="post-content">You can recreate any color map using color modifier with some patience and experimentation... it is made a little awkward by the way that the color modifier works. It only compiles the 'per channel' box for 256 different values of r/g/b 3 times so you can't mix channels, e.g. red=green+blue doesn't have a particularly well defined result.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>One remix</strong><br />
      Ok Super i added the suggestion i posted and i completly over-hauled your color map i also removed effects that slowed the preset down but did not destroy the quality.<br />
      enjoy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice looking preset mate!<br />
      <br />
      I'll play around with mine some more to improve the colors. That's just fine if you throw that in your pack as a remix, it's a very nice looking preset now. Much more colorful then mine that's for sure, slightly off my original sweet/smooth concept, but very well done!</p>
