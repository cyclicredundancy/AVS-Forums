      <p class="post-content"><strong>is there anything like AVS out there</strong><br />
      What I mean is, sure there is a lot of profesional visualisation software out there but I havent seen anything that isnt a video mixer.<br />
      damn it, visualization for the desktop is a whole diferent story. like a user is gona mix his visuals :(. so what Im asking is, is there any software out there that doesnt require the knowlege of c++ or some NOT FREE editor to make renders that react to live music?<br />
      Yeah I'm drunk again :D. i Hate all the money hungry world out there. Dont get me wrong Im aware of the fact Im gonna hawe to suck money to surwiwe but i STIL HATE IT. Money sucks! If things go on this way Im gonna have to pay for whipeing my ass very soon. Wait a minute I already pay for TP:).Yup, im drunk:). Anyways if things go on this way in a couple of years all the VIS bizz is gonna be owned bi Bill eat my D** gates. Which sucks lammas balls. Whaaaa, if only Steven would start that project he was talkin about(the open GL one) Im sure he wouldn charge for it, and if I wasnt so not up to date with this Comp stuff I would learn C just to help him out. Damn it the world needs something like that (you could say Im the selfish bastard who needs it :D).<br />
      <br />
      hmm I just rememberd, there is this opensource program called proce55ing(made for programing visuals-not misic reactive ones). maybee those gys could build some kind somethig that would listen to soud:?.but maybee that is out of date technology too:?.who knows, Im gonna ask them about it. I love music visualization. curently its the only thing I would spend my life for(in vino veritas - or something like that)which sucks because im a student of industrial design. And I nedd that diploma as a VIP pass for life, but I just hate that Commercial shit.<br />
      You could say im beeing childish here, but fuck mass apeal. Fuck money, fuck it:D. If I told you Im 24 years old would you belive it? Gues not:D.Especialy if you saw a photo of me:D. But as you see I dont give a f**k(the stars are there to prevent this idiot post from being deleted:).(my worst english so far:DDD) no this is my best and favorite post, where I talk about everything that is on my (wanna be dont give a f**c)mind. Somethin like I love all you people that spend a few minutes or more of your (once in a lifetime ) life:D:D to do music visualisation of any kind out there,in this sick world filled with Bushes and shit like that.Why? because I love it, it makes my life worth liveing and all that shit. You and all my real life friends, thats what I live for (and me offcurse:))(even if you dont feel the same way I dont care)(because you know FUCK THE WIND<br />
      :)(which doesnt mean anything to you especilay if you are mature:))))<br />
      Just lestenig to Luis armstrong- what a wonderfull word:D(he was a Smoker:) Now if this post makes any sence at all Im a winner:D. IM happy, are you? . Do you nhave to be drunk to be happy ? My father does:D( I just have to be stoned :),Use it to save load or quit:D It's a closet my master how are you gonna get him with it? Im gonna get him with my super PC which is prety standard it also has a 2 USB ports and a FIREWIRE it allsoo has an input pen for easy input which is most usefull in medicine and indutrial design inteligence. This comp here comes with a 1 GB procesor with a 360 degree rotateble screen and its very user friendly as well or you can just buy a regular computer with a belowawerage cooler and power conwerters mesaured in Wats.<br />
      650 w POWER CONVERTERS ARE THE BEST, they provide the best posible power suply ever , but if the napajalik is too weak the graphic card doesnt get enough power to run your awerage AVS preset even dough AVS doesnt use Geraphic cards (yes radion dosent mater much here:p)<br />
      dID YOU EVER WISH YOUR COMP COULD READ your notes or a email or a projection to the team or a subject like notes or e- mail. This makes as much sence as ... dunno what:P bnot(stupide):D:Pif you pres S for Stop your Power point presentation will stop or will it, Hmmm if you press it again it will surley happen. You bet:P.the letter E will help you a lot with this task or the combination Ctrl-v is usefull asswell:). So a bIG HIpp HIPP for you me and allof uss (damn Im gonna regret this in the morning}:}NOT or YES:P. big LOVE from sLOVEnija. FSK the smilie abusser:D<br />
      you might need your PC in your 1.st flor while you are in your 2. flor<br />
      and because of that you need a real keyboard, not a fake one with real buttons but a fancy one with virtual ones. iF YOU ARE NOT SURE let me reasure you its the shit YOU need. THE REAL SHIT. like this bull shit post of mine without an exception (or a spell misstake) AND WITHOUT SENCE ASS WELL. By the way does your ass feel well ass well?<br />
      You can listen to info on your comp, even your passwords which is bad BUY firewall or Waterwall or simply buy the neagar falls or... hmm out of dumb ideas NOT Im gonna write 100 KB off letters which will alll together be the dumbest mousiest post ever:P. So if you are an internet enthusiast you can esaly navigate though this but if you are bnot then {then the hell with you and me}.<br />
      info shot with too many features inbstead of haveing a simple user friendly, a more expensive feature like draving by the grid in Microsoft Excell. So if you fell bad or pissed of while reading my post think about what it would feel like if you wrote it:? No that doesnt make sence ass well. But I HAVE to tell you all this is realy serious not some whack shit!Yeah man I'm as serious as a serial murderer. NO im as serious as the guy that tels you you have to pay a fine for smokeing pot(that would be the judge). And if you dont take this serious you my friend are a hopeless piece of A politician or somethin that spells similrly. And after all of this gibberish ,ALL i CAN SAY , is FELL FREE TO DISS!<br />
      love and A KISS FROM FSK!<br />
      (I dont drink very often).<br />
      <br />
      And the question is serious(the toppic one:)).<br />
      <br />
      WAIT wait im not finnished yet there is still a few KB to go. So imagine that you are in the guiniues book off vynyls. If you are still readig you can be in it, for the most borred person on the planet.OK so maybee this putting myselff down shit is really puting mysellf up shit, but I dont think so becuse I think you guys arent gonna buy this 199.999euro shit, or even my fsk lowgo for that matter. maybee you would buy some more pussy smoke (no offence)but just maybee it wouldnt be worth the 0 SIT or $ you pay for it so what its free anyway and it helps me write some Xtra Special shit here for Ya. Even if it bull and hasent anything to do with visualization. Or would ya? Guess not. Or I am I wrong here.Where is that you might ask?Right here hhere the REAL shit IS. written with cappittall leetteerrss. wITh nO NONSENCE.<br />
      <br />
      f**k THOSE eXtraa KB's they are free.</p>

Im sorry for that comfuseing post, but if you read it to about the second smilie, (it makes sence till then) you would see I'm asking about a program like AVS or Milkdrop which wasnt made for live mixeing of video clips and stuff, but to simly be there and move with music.</p>

      <br />
      Seriously though, there are a few alternatives to AVS (Tripex, R2 and so on), but to my knowledge if you want to write your own presets the choice is between AVS and MilkDrop - both of which have unfortunately not been updated in a very long time :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ummh nothing as yeah really fits the bill IMHO.<br />
      <br />
      Resolume and ARkoas honestly do not do what you want.<br />
      <br />
      VisualJOckey is a nice product detailed but does not seem to be scriptable/programmable as I and I imagine we would like.<br />
      <br />
      It is all drag and drop boxes and is amore 3dstudio max than a programming/scripting thing. That is teh market theya re going for though.<br />
      <br />
      R3 may not be open source. But if are will to learn Java which is what I beleive it will now be written in then you can input into it and be in the beta loop and add more stuff.<br />
      <br />
      I also want to get stuck into written/helping with a new project. I can do a few nice-ish things in OPenGL now.<br />

      <p class="post-content">He's saying that he wants to make a new AVS-like visualization program since AVS is hard to update.<br />
      People asked for non-winamp based programs, but Winamp is better than any other mp3 players(IMHO). Sure, sometimes you would rather have AVS respond to sound played in something besides winamp, but that is what linein is for.</p>
