<div class="posttext">:cry: Atero was banned :cry:<br />
<br />
I think this is the first time somebody has been banned in AVS...correct me if I'm wrong</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nope I have banned one other before. A search for Unconed neo nazi virus writer will probably do the trick. :)<br />
<br />
There should be no need to ban anyone from these forums. Play nice people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree Rova.  Atero definitely went over the top.  At least he isn't permbanned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree too. But it is sort of hard to believe he got banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't find it hard to believe - that sort of behaviour is unacceptable. And there was absolutely no need for any of it. In fact there was no moral/personal ground to be made with any of that ranting - so why do it? <br />
Like I said to him many times - he's got alot of knowledge, if he uses it wisely the world is his oyster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2003, 03:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Legohead, you are also guilty of exhibiting some unacceptable behavior.  You both got out of hand with the flaming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">legohead</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2003, 03:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes but I actually had a point to make that was for the greater good. I don't deny that and Ive apologised to other forum members for that. There was a damn good reason for it, and its panned out the way its meant to have panned out if that type of behaviour was to dissolve.<br />
There's only one language that the Atero's of this world seem to understand - and thats there own.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have to disagree with you.  Not all of your posts had any point whatsoever except to flame atero.  Atero understands you, but he doesn't agree, and responds in his own way.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Atero, before you go, there's something I want to say...&quot;<br />
&quot;Who is going to take over the devart 3 years project?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would take charge, but i don't know how to autodetect both winamps&quot;<br />
&quot;And i thought you would still come back to finish it&quot;<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">He didn't quite realise that a forum is not a democracy and free speech is not entirely accepted. Atero will be missed but the ban was entirely justified, he took it too far and paid the consequences. I have nothing more to say on the matter except about the projects he underwent.<br />
<br />
Does anyone want to redo an avs primer? I would take that on but my knowledge of avs is limited. The deviantart 3 year project? Anyone who wants to take over any of the projects that were his should speak up and get it sorted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The Primer thing should be up to the whole community, i think.<br />
<br />
If everyone agrees, i'd be willing to share my account so we'd have a webspace for exchanging.<br />
<br />
Together we'd be able to do a primer which is really good and we'Re having enough n00bs around to &quot;TEST&quot; it on them.<br />
<br />
@ TUG: we can dedicate this to Aero then :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2003, 19:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">LOL @ Tuggummi.You really have tooooo much free time.For DA i propose Tugg as coordinator and for the Primer lets let Atero finish it and maybe he`ll give it to someone for posting(from #finnish-flash).I also agree with Magic`s idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2003, 20:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Lets all work together on a complete primer, an entire thing that has three different levels: noob, intermediate and proffesional.<br />
<br />
The noob one would contain information about how the default things work and how to do some very simple movement coding and just to generally get used to avs.<br />
Intermediate would contain some simple variable settings, more complex movements. Drawing superscopes. Some stuff out of the tips and tricks page, some semi complex DM's at the end.<br />
The proffesional one would contain information on complex DM's, raytracing, 3d rotation in superscopes. How to do draw 3d objects.<br />
<br />
All the information to do this is all around us, these forums have been here a long time and i'm quite sure that most if not all of this could be found if we put in a little effort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would offer help because html and css are the only other types of coding where my knowledge exceeds that of avs, quite largely. I'm too busy with html with mine and my friends site being built so i don't think i can help you  though. You probably want to do it yourself anyway though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's not going to be anything major coding wise.  Just using html, because it offers much more than text documents.  I'll include plenty of avs presets as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For persistent and or deliberate rule-breakers your account will be &quot;Nuked&quot;. That means you are no longer welcome on these forums and your account will no longer function. If you re-register, your new account will be nuked immediately and any new threads/posts will automatically be removed, regardless of their nature Once tempbanned, you've only got one conditional chance to return(the condition being you stay gone til you're unbanned and then follow the rules of the forum).  Since he chose to not follow that condition, he's effectively permabanned himself.  I've tried to talk with him in email, but obviously he's not now and was never interested in what I've got to say.<br />

It's in the rules (http://forums.winamp.com/rules.php), just as flaming is also in the rules (http://forums.winamp.com/rules.php).  If anyone thinks that ignorance of the law is an excuse for commiting the crime, I have some underhanded things for you to do for me :).<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Atero can't claim that anyway. How many times in the past has he flamed noobs to hell because they didn't read the FAQ's or search the forums. The rules are right there in &quot;big fucking letters&quot; for all to see. Ignorance is no excuse. A permban is not something you just make up an excuse and you can fix it in the morning. Face it, he's gone. I'm not completely convinced though because he is a valued member of the AVS community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th April 2003, 00:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It is still possible that he could be allowed back, but it is extremely unlikely and the mods would probably not be willing to do it.  Besides, going by his most recent posts, I would say that he may not want to come back.</div></div><hr />

nope. but i'm talking to gonzotek about it, he says he'd make a case for me <br />

<div class="posttext">What a forum! Our noobiator got banned and our mod got drunk... :p<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">But as we all know Atero, behaving as a princess has never been his stongest side.. I doubt that even if he promisses to behave, he'll never swear or flame toward n00bs again. That just isn't who he is. This makes it really hard for him to ever come back. I don't say this to piss off Atero, but just to show how hard it is if he ever wants to come back here.<br />
<br />
It's sad as it is though, but this was the only thing the mods could do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th April 2003, 18:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Does anyone else find it a bit lame that almost everyone in these forums has flamed the n00bs to some extent and that extensive flaming has gone on in several threads then all of a sudden atero flames a mod and then gets banned straight away. I thought the mods were always watching... if there was tighter control in the first place then this situation may never have occured.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Gonzotek</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th April 2003, 18:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">We're human, and unpaid, not bots.  The pendulum swings from relaxed to controlled, when it comes to moderating.  When we've allowed things to go on with out a lot of intervention, we eventually begin to get negative feeback that we're not doing our jobs.  But (and the recent event is proof of this) as soon as we try to fairly reinforce what the rules dictate(in response to that feedback), we get negative feedback that we're &quot;abusing our power&quot; or similar.  My personal style is to try hard to use reasoning and persuasion before resorting to any moderator functions.  But sometimes you aren't given a choice.<br />
<br />
All I can say at this point is that we can't change the past, so lets work on a better forum for tomorrow.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Its your decision to make but personally I would have been much softer on flaming at first and then gradually increased the strictness around here. <br />
<br />
Rapid changes are always bad, they cause extinction where as gradual changes allow for adaptation. i.e. You could have changed Atero but instead you banned him. But like I said it was your decision to make and not mine. I'm going to stop being bitter about it now and get on with other things like 'Jheriko - Pack VIII'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, you've made a false assumption.  Atero wasn't banned by me.  I didn't make that decision.  I didn't have _anything_ to do it the second time round, either.  Prior to that, I asked him to change and I invited him and everyone else to enlighten me about how this forum should be run.  Go check every post I've made here in the last three for four days and tell me otherwise.  What more could I have done?<br />

I just thought what Atero would have said to that if he'd still be here...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Damn, take a week off and things go nuts around here. Too bad 'bout the banning, but if things kept up it was bound to happen to someone. We lost a good, though hot tempered member. Hopefully it won't happen again. Cheers to mods, new and old.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think his banning was needed,<br />
He was runing rampant, We need something like this to sort out any fag who wants to look important by messing with another persons fun. To hell with the FAQ... I really couldnt care. Just be courteous and polite and people should help others, cant we just be logical. If I came up on the street and asked you for help would you just spit in my face with things like this... hell no, im over 6ft tall and I bodybuild for over an hour a day. If you wouldnt say it to their face. Dont say it at all. A motto you should live by... I do!<br />
And im all the better for it.<br />
Would 14 Year old Stuart Raven go off and 30+ year old peers... no.<br />
The internet does not turn a NERD into a BARBARIAN.<br />
Please, Keep your fucking manners.<br />
<br />
I hope you read all of that,<br />
CAUSE ITLL HELP YOU.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, here is a counter example. Where I work there is a sign on a door saying 'Press button to open door', ironically it is in large red letters. When I first started there if someone asked 'How do I open the door' I was polite and explained about the button. After working at the same place for the past five months I am now completely sick and tired of telling new employees how to open the door, due to the high turnover of staff at my workplace this question comes up a lot. Now if someone asks me there is at least a 50% chance that I will explain to them in 'clear' language exactly how blind they must be to not see the clearly printed white and red eye-level sign which is placed on the door which tells them exactly how to open it.<br />
<br />
Dealing with stupid questions continually gets frustrating.<br />
<br />
Then again I find stupid people tiresome in general.</div></div><hr />
