<br />
<div class="posttext">because sine is an expensive operation, if you fill the megabuf with a load of sines of 0-$pi you can reference the megabuf rather than doing an actual sin(x) because sin(x)=megabuf(x*scaling factor) much cheaper. The advantage really comes if your doing sines in the point box. Mind you the rotation matrices can be done in frame so the speed benefit would be pretty small... good for any other trig stuff in point/pixel tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2005, 16:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, somehow i thought on rotation matrices... cause then it's really just a marginal + in speed.<br />
<br />
let me just repeat that idea, to see if i understood it correct: in innit you store y-values of a sin-function into the megabuf using loop and assign and stuff. Then you, when it comes to the point you need the values, you don't calulate a sin of a variable, but get it directly from the corresponding entry in megabuf. Tricky, and that read-out-method really provides a noticeable advantaqe compared to &quot;sin(..)&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2005, 18:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yea thats the idea, a sin() is a lot lot slower than a x=megabuf(y), just fill a ssc point box with 100 sines and compare it to a 100 megabuf retrievals. The slower part is the conversion process because say you have 100 megabuf entries of:<br />
<br />
sin(($pi*2)/100)<br />
sin(($pi*2)/100*2)<br />
sin(($pi*2)/100*3) <br />
etc.. <br />
<br />
you can have a counter t=(t+1)%100 which is nice an quick to reference but if you specifically want sin(23) or something you need a calculation to get the megabuf reference... <br />
<br />
i.e. make it fall between 0 and 2*pi <br />
<br />
((23*100)%628)*0.01;<br />
<br />
but covert it to a reference<br />
<br />
floor((23*100)%628);<br />
<br />
Its a multiply and divide (mod is a divide) as opposed to a sin() so its still cheaper, but its a bit more complicated, and of course the accuracy of the result is limited to the number of sines you calculated on init.<br />
<br />
I think that maths is right, im not in front of avs so I cant check.</div></div><hr />

I still maintain that retrieving the item of the stack is quicker than a sine, I'll have to check evallib to see the exact full method by which each is performed but I would be very surprised to find otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you can't figure it out (it's justin-style coding):<br />
<br />
_asm_megabuf is the ASM code for the AVS function megabuf(x)<br />
<br />
It calls __megabuf, which is in fact the same as megabuf_, just with a slightly different declaration:<br />
<br />
static double * (NSEEL_CGEN_CALL *__megabuf)(double ***,double *) = &amp;megabuf_;<br />
<br />
And megabuf_ is the huge-ass function at the top.<br />
<br />
Now, for sin, the asm code for the function is:<br />
<br />
  __asm <br />
  {<br />
    fld qword ptr [eax]<br />
    fsin<br />
    mov eax, esi<br />
    fstp qword ptr [esi]<br />
    add esi, 8<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<br />
Still convinced megabuf is faster?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow, the code behind megabuf is huge! Although it is beyond me to understand that code :eek: But all this is executed when avs uses megabuf or gmegabuf?<br />
OK, i see that calculating a sin here is actually faster than retrieving data from the megabuf, though it seems strange when you look at it with pure logic.<br />
<br />
btw: how did you look up the code for sin and megabuf? Can it be red from the vis_avs.dll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th February 2005, 16:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Just because the megabuf code is long and convoluted doesnt mean its slower. The sine function looks all lovely and neat but it doesnt have any clever hacks, the bottom line is it calls an fsin which is 16-126 clock cycles, and we're double precision here so most of the time I reckon your looking at the upper end of that figure.<br />
<br />
The megabuf function is almost entirely mov instructions which are... you guessed it... a big fat 1 clock cycle each. In fact depending on the alignment of code in memory accessing data from a register can be LESS than 1 clock cycle. I think I also see a sub, thats 2 clock cycles, an add, thats about 2. Those condition statements, all the if's, are jne's jnz's etc.. which are mostly 3 clock cycles.<br />
<br />
Also the compiler will optimise the ASM a bit for the megabuf code, but it cant optimise an fsin its just one instruction. I'd guess If you follow the code through a megabuf retrieval its (very) roughly 40-50 clocks, and thats without any compiler optimisation, and not accounting for code alignment etc...<br />

<div class="posttext">fsin takes longer for higher numbers<br />
<br />
double precision is just a means of storing floating point values in the RAM. it doesnt influence fsin's speed at all.<br />
<br />
when loading a double or a float, the FPU converts it to an 80 bit floating point value, which is then stored to one of the FPU's registers<br />
<br />
and afaik msvc6 doesnt optimize asm<br />
<br />
do you really thing those dozens of pointer operations are faster than fsin?<br />
not counting the stuff that is needed around the megabuf call</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
_asm_megabuf is about 8 mov's and a sub, and some quick stack work to megabuf_ so its really quick. megabuf_ looks big and ugly but if you break it down:<br />
<br />
<br />
  static double error;<br />
  int w=(int)(*which + 0.0001);<br />
  int whichblock = w/MEGABUF_ITEMSPERBLOCK;<br />
<br />
<br />
this is the setup for the function, a few movs an add and a div (most expensive op in the function)<br />
<br />
<br />
  if (!*blocks)<br />
  {<br />
    *blocks = (double **)GlobalAlloc(GPTR,sizeof(double *)*MEGABUF_BLOCKS);<br />
  }<br />
  if (!*blocks) return &amp;error;<br />
<br />
<br />
These conditions arent met in a normal retrieval so its just two conditions about 3 clocks each<br />
<br />
<br />
  if (w &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; whichblock &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; whichblock &lt; MEGABUF_BLOCKS)<br />
  {<br />
    int whichentry = w%MEGABUF_ITEMSPERBLOCK;<br />
<br />
<br />
This condition gets entered, a few conditions movs and a mod (another div, damnit justin) <br />
<br />
<br />
    if (!(*blocks)[whichblock])<br />
    {<br />
      (*blocks)[whichblock]=(double *)GlobalAlloc(GPTR,sizeof(double)*MEGABUF_ITEMSPERBLOCK);<br />
    }<br />
<br />
<br />
This condition is not met in a normal megabuf retrieval, so its just a few clocks for the check<br />
<br />
<br />
    if ((*blocks)[whichblock])<br />
      return &amp;(*blocks)[whichblock][whichentry];<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the actual memory retirieval, a few clocks for the condition and some stack work to return the value, another few clocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
  return &amp;error;<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesnt get reached<br />
<br />
you see its really not that slow, those divs are probably the slowest thing in it, but dont forget they are integer divisions not floating point so they arent that slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">megabuf involves lots of memory access, whereas fsin is just 2 of them (getting the value from [eax] i think and storing the result back to it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th March 2005, 22:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Pak, are you just being obtuse? Any AVS code involves doubles. That means that even the megabuf indexes are calculated in floating point and then rounded to ints (which is a significant speed hit as well). Then there's the huge megabuf lookup procedure, which translates to a 100 lines of ASM code or so.<br />
<br />
The floating point sine op has to take one value which is already in the cache and sine it. The algorithm to do this is implemented in hardware and fully pipelined. As Tomy said, the upper time limit for sine calculations is for really huge angles, which tend to be rare in AVS anyway, and which you don't even handle in your current code. Handling them would be even worse because you'd need a bunch of evallib code in AVS to do that and there is no easy floating point modulus function/instruction/operator in evallib.<br />
<br />
The fact is: evallib is pretty darn close to ASM when it comes to floating point operations. That's what it is designed for. No amount of wishful thinking or self-righteousness is going to change that. So let's drop this topic while you still have your dignity, sweetheart. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th March 2005, 14:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Fine, I will drop this subject but after a last post (because I want the last word):<br />
<br />
first of all my point about the divisions is that they are integer divisions, in assembly they will by 'divs' not 'fdivs' because Justin has explicitly arranged it that way, for example<br />
<br />
int w=(int)(*which + 0.0001);<br />
int whichblock = w/MEGABUF_ITEMSPERBLOCK;<br />
<br />
a division of two integer values. Yes the values have to be rounded first and yes that will slow it down but the divides themselves are integer.<br />
<br />
Secondly I already explained that more lines of code doesnt necessarily mean its slower<br />
<br />
Thirdly I already explained that memory access and moving is all just mov's which are incredibly quick<br />
<br />
Fourth if you actually bothered making some preset tests with loads of sines and loads of megabuf retrievals youd see the megabuf retrievals come out faster. So bottom line in real world tests megabuf is faster.<br />
<br />
Fifth and finally, dont fucking condescend to me. I'm just voicing my opinion on a technical subject I dont appreciate you trying to make me look stupid.<br />
<br />
Okay, consider the topic finished, as we said at the start the realistic difference it makes in normal AVS use is negligible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Re divs: You're forgetting all the extra evallib code needed to actually /use/ the megabuf. For sin(), you just pass in the angle directly and don't need to do anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fourth if you actually bothered making some preset tests with loads of sines and loads of megabuf retrievals youd see the megabuf retrievals come out faster. So bottom line in real world tests megabuf is faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
So did you make actual test cases, or just a loop where you calculate a sine 10000 times? Caching will completely destroy any validity of such an artificial test. Furthermore, if you just do a loop in evallib code, you're not actually doing anything in between, like actually drawing SSC points or lines, which will cause the cache to get filled with image data instead.<br />
<br />

<br />
if you mean the code the user types to get the right megabuf entry then yes that is another overhead, I already meantioned that a few posts up.<br />
<br />
I have done tests, the difference is insignificant but it is faster with megabuf. The tests I've done are just making presets of average complexity in my own style, and thats probably a harsher test than is necessary since 90% of AVS'rs dont make presets with as much code as I or you would.<br />
<br />
I'd be lying if I said I regularily make sin lookup tables for presets, its a massive fag for little result. The closest thing I use is lookups for my rotation matrices for high point/triangle count stuff (please god dont start an argument about that as well)<br />
