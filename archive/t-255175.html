      <p class="post-content">Dude, relax about the Japanese releases.<br />
      <br />
      This is a very good idea but I was really hoping all the releases would be in one executable.</p>

      <br />
      however, you could install the all with /S switch (silent installation), not sure though if those old installers could do some damage to installed apes.

      It's not like I'm expecting an HD crash, but you never really know for sure when you're talking about an entire year.. anything could happen.<br />
      <br />
      And shodan:<br />
      <br />
      google for the term 'exclusive' and have a nice cup of '<b>shut the fuck up</b>'<br />
      <br />
      Noone's forcing you to download it.<br />
      if you don't like it, don't use it.<br />
      and mostly: don't complain about free services<br />
      <br />
      While you're at it, search for the term 'trolling' aswell</p>

      <p class="post-content">Calm down WotL!! He is allowed to complain, from his quote from the visbot site... he should expect to get ALL the presets... not some. False advertising!<br />
      <br />
      Not that I like the idea of country exclusive presets... given the small number of people who care about AVS (or have ever cared) its likely some countries are entirely without AVS!<br />
      <br />
      I can offer free but shaky hosting on a jheriko.kicks-ass.net domain if you want a more permanent home :p<br />
      <br />
      It only ever goes down when I have guests or crashes... people who aren't me seem to enjoy sleep without the humming of fans :/</p>
