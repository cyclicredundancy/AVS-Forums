<div class="posttext">Nice pack ! :) Some really innovative stuff there.I also wanted to do a tunnel movement DM but mine morphed a bit and sucked yours is very nice.I also wanted to do the cube thingie but you did it before.Damn its like you looked into my mind ! :) Anyway i`d give it a 4.5 ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Intro - Doesn't show at all... you forgot to change the second list's input to Replace, now it's ignore :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Liquid Tunnel - Ok, the chrome is nice, but it could be more dynamic move around and such.<br />
<br />
Black Fire - Eeh, nice idea, but too messy i think.<br />
<br />
Unstable Building - 3D scuperscopes... nothing else in my opnion.<br />
<br />
Split the Cube - This is nice, i like the flash music reaction and the scopes are nice. Though the sides don't look solid when they strecth out, increase the numpoints. And when you're using solid shapes it's best to but the n value to the frame section and use w&amp;h something like n=w*0.3 (depending on the size of course) This will make sure it works with all resolutions and that it doesn't draw anymore lines than necessary.<br />
<br />
Unending Trench - Well tunnel presets are always nice, but you could try to do something a bit original with it since you have the advantage of not using colors.<br />
<br />
Dice - Really nice scopes, though could use the cube lines also. And the background is good too. Nice beat response also. Great work :up:<br />
<br />
Classic! - I got the idea, i just don't like it :D<br />
<br />
Uknown - Static &amp; kinda boring. I've just had enough of hedrons thank you.<br />
<br />
Chess Board - Nice idea &amp; good beat detection, but the alpha blending just sucks and bothers me a lot making it hard to enjoy the preset.<br />
<br />
Metal Pit - UnConeD's mercury... just joking :D Looks good.<br />
<br />
Getting Warmer - Weird... Original though. Nicely done.<br />
<br />
Split the Cube (High Slow Quality - Uhm what? Oh it looks more solid eeh? Just do what i said in the first version and you only need one version of it :)<br />
<br />
Warm - Nice dynamove.<br />
<br />
Lord of the rings - Show off :p A bit boring for a preset.<br />
<br />
A little bit of colour - You're right, it doesn't belong in the pack. But it's nice for what it is. A rotoblitter like preset :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall not a bad pack, but you didn't quite use the power of b&amp;w. Now they look like they were made b&amp;w by force. Try to make them look like colors aren't an option and you got yourself some great presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, i think forum-users have it. might be different with the ordinary consumer :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">consumer as in regular guy who just views AVS doesnt understand how it works and use it to get chicks. The average bear who downloads the pack maybe wont have all the APEs and the public release should have them.I think thats what killahbite is trying to say :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2003, 17:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">oh well, i dont think the 'consumers' visit here. i have included all the ape's needed in the installer sent to the winamp site. <br />
but it seems the 'regular customers' too have the ape's. because they must have downloaded other packs, and most of the artist do use the extra ape's.<br />
<br />
but hey, lets just forget it! topic changed again!</div></div><hr />
