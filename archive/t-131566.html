      <p class="post-content"><strong>winamp.com has a new reviewer</strong><br />
      AFter chatting backstage about it we have a new reviewer for the website it is anubis2003.<br />
      <br />
      SOrry there is no voting etc for it the reviewers do try and represent your views (i really do not review all that much mostly there for moral support and to stop to many 5star packs coming out - I am a harsh reviewer. :) so don't worry about me )<br />
      <br />
      But it is really up to us and anubis2003 seemed a popular choice/member here anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Actaully the real reason is taht I am on commission from keyboard companys and want him to type even more so I get more commision. A thousand posts a month was only a keyboard every month or something. :);):p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Need I remind you again about rules concerning flaming?<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Flaming<br />
        - Material that is knowingly defamatory, illegal, abusive, threatening or harassing, is strictly prohibited. As with anything, you, as a member, should use good common sense when posting. In other words, you agree not to be a jerk. Posts containing personal attacks on another user will be edited or deleted with no warning or consent.
      </blockquote>With an attitude like that, there is no way on earth you will be given a position of responsibility here.<br />
      Who do you think we give access rights out to the inner workings of this site to ?, anyone who feels they should have them?<br />
      <br />
      Wrong, reviewers are carefully picked, and if they are considered to be unsuitable, they simply won't be given the gig.<br />
      <br />
      We do not need some unstable element who could inflict massive damage to both the presets &amp; skin databases one day , simply because they are having a bad day and decide to "fuck someone over", won't happen, not this week, not next.<br />
      <br />
      Simple as that, I'll personally make sure it dosn't happen.<br />
      <br />
      Have a nice day and loose the attitude :)

      <br />
      They're have been no new reviewers added since it was setup apart from teh other day when anubis2003 was added.<br />
      <br />
      After the agro here recently it did no encourage me to add you to the reviews list or any opther position of 'power'. Anyway it was discussed with the reviews and anubis2003 was choosen. Sorry it was not a debating point.<br />
      <br />
      And Atero don't prove my re-enabling your account to be a mistake (begining to think it is) and I have to ban you again. I have been more than reasonable with you.

      I was able to make a couple of reviews while on vacation, but since I was on dialup:mad: I didn't make many and didn't make very many posts here at all. Thanks to everyone for the congratulations. I'll try not to let you down.</p>
