<div class="posttext">AFter chatting backstage about it we have a new reviewer for the website it is anubis2003.<br />
<br />
SOrry there is no voting etc for it the reviewers do try and represent your views (i really do not review all that much mostly there for moral support and to stop to many 5star packs coming out - I am a harsh reviewer. :) so don't worry about me )<br />
<br />
But it is really up to us and anubis2003 seemed a popular choice/member here anyway.<br />
<br />
Actaully the real reason is taht I am on commission from keyboard companys and want him to type even more so I get more commision. A thousand posts a month was only a keyboard every month or something. :);):p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally, i don't want to know who is reviewing my stuff, I don't care, it's strict &quot;business&quot; between him/her/it and me. But wo-hoo for anubis still :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Need I remind you again about rules concerning flaming?<br />
<br />
<br />
Flaming <br />
- Material that is knowingly defamatory, illegal, abusive, threatening or harassing, is strictly prohibited. As with anything, you, as a member, should use good common sense when posting. In other words, you agree not to be a jerk. Posts containing personal attacks on another user will be edited or deleted with no warning or consent. <br />
<br />
<br />
With an attitude like that, there is no way on earth you will be given a position of responsibility here.<br />
Who do you think we give access rights out to the inner workings of this site to ?, anyone who feels they should have them?<br />
<br />
Wrong, reviewers are carefully picked, and if they are considered to be unsuitable, they simply won't be given the gig.<br />
<br />
We do not need some unstable element who could inflict massive damage to both the presets &amp; skin databases one day , simply because they are having a bad day and decide to &quot;fuck someone over&quot;, won't happen, not this week, not next.<br />
<br />
Simple as that, I'll personally make sure it dosn't happen. <br />
<br />
Have a nice day and loose the attitude :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I got this review, not about the praising, it is just the descrition..never seen such a kind of review except great pack, solid presets..:) god bless the reviewer :p<br />
<br />
&quot;Very original technical and aesthetic presets in this pack. These presets range from a one-of-a-kind dice preset and an amazingly beat responsive cube to some very aesthetic tunnel presets. Definitely worth the download.&quot;</div></div><hr />

fuck you rocker, that was way before i got banned.  rova NEVER replied.  <br />
<br />
I replied in general terms on the threads in the forums. 'Sorry for all those that were interested maybe next time etc.' <br />
<br />
They're have been no new reviewers added since it was setup apart from teh other day when anubis2003 was added.<br />
<br />
After the agro here recently it did no encourage me to add you to the reviews list or any opther position of 'power'. Anyway it was discussed with the reviews and anubis2003 was choosen. Sorry it was not a debating point. <br />
<br />
And Atero don't prove my re-enabling your account to be a mistake (begining to think it is) and I have to ban you again. I have been more than reasonable with you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Shreyas, you like that?:p <br />
<br />
I was able to make a couple of reviews while on vacation, but since I was on dialup:mad: I didn't make many and didn't make very many posts here at all.  Thanks to everyone for the congratulations.  I'll try not to let you down.</div></div><hr />
