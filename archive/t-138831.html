      Suprisingly, the people at Nullsoft actually fixed something for the AVS 2.6.1:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        * AVS evallib | and &amp; operator fixes
      </blockquote>get winamp 2.92 at<br />

      <p class="post-content">michael that wasnt a virus...search the forums about this subject,there was a huge scandal about some "lost" winamp 4 versions.Again,i mention that there is NOTHING about AVS 3.If we`d all post a special request in the technicall forum maybe SOMEONE would notice it and would try implementing some of the features in the wishlist.Its a dumb idea,i know,but....Its dumb!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thats not the only thing they changed.<br />
      <br />
      Since AVS 2.6 the "real" avswnd is a client subwindow to another one managing the sizeclipping and so on.<br />
      <br />
      Thats why hotlist 2.1 will have troubles, but i fixed it for 2.2<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, i tryed to resize avs 2.6 by windows messages but it seems there is no way cheating the resize mechanism unless you use a stretching method and bilinear filtering. But this would suck fps again... :(<br />
      <br />
      Best way is to rename the old vis_avs.dll into vis_avs2.51.dll and keep it. I hope the Nullsofties will improve their skinning so they won't need size clipping.</p>

      </blockquote>The bitwise operator change may mess things up true but only more than likely to a some degree unless the presets are focusing in lots of the rounding difference that will occur.<br />
      <br />
      Atero it still amazes me your knowledge sometimes. MilkDrop is a Nullsoft plug-in I have no idea where your third party idea has come from. It has been said before many times.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway it doesn't change the fact that AVS hasn't been updated for like 2 years. I have done my best to get get more recognistion from keeping things updated here to setting up a review team on winamp.com so that there is less strain on the Nullsoft staff to do review and hopefully increase exposure to AVS &amp; devolpment.<br />
      <br />
      BTW hasn't this topic been posted before?!? (at least teh subject matter has I am sure)

      <p class="post-content">I used | to create the mechanical curvature presets.. it shouldn't mess them up too much though, since hopefully the new | will round to an integer before doing the bitwise bit.. I'm not quite sure what type of floats AVS uses, nor am I sure of the effects of bit or-ing and integer with a float if there is no rounding.</p>
