<div class="posttext">As i said i was working through your Primer in order to get some more knowledge on 3d stuff. Well i figured out that something was missing.<br />

Minimum Blend<br />
   Uses the least amount of color between the two frames.  I can't<br />
   remember where this is used, but it's not usable in effect lists.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Its used in UnConeD's APE's (Picture RendererII and Corlor Map). I'd advise you to either leave this out, or to explain those APE's too.<br />
<br />
Originally written by Atero <br />
XOR<br />
   Don't know anything about what this is, but it's trippy.<br />
 <br />
<br />
To understand XOR generally we need to know that eXclusiveOR means nothing else than a boolean or - but excluding the and.<br />
<br />
The programming code woud be: x xor y = (x or y) and not (x and y)<br />
<br />
And here is a tabe to make this more obvious:<br />
<br />
x|y|result<br />
-+-+------<br />
0|0|0<br />
0|1|1<br />
1|0|1<br />
1|1|0] <br />
<br />
As we know, the color channels are calculated seperately.<br />
<br />
Now we imagine x and y to be the two red-channel values.<br />
<br />
First, AVS converts them too boolean values which means dividing by 255 and rounding up or down.<br />
<br />
That means a color value of 128-255 is 1, a color value of 0-127 is 0.<br />
<br />
Then, AVS does XOR, as explained before.<br />
Finally we need to get a useable color value as a result which means multiplying the result with 255.<br />
<br />
To put it in a nutshell, a value above 127 and a value below 128 will result in a full valued color channel with 255, if the values are both above 127 or below 128 this will result in color channel of 0.<br />
<br />
Well, i could also have pm'ed this but if Atero did'nt know about XOR there are probably more around who don't either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Erhm... You know there is a thread about the primer uptade already at http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=121697 Also you could've just PM atero , why make a new thread about it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, seems i to sorta missed the primer update thread.<br />
<br />
But anyway, this is not just about updating the Primer, but mainly about XOR Blending (renamed the Topic) and this way the 2-3 months old thread wont be revived.<br />
<br />
/Edit<br />
And this way there may be more newbies profiting from it because they wont have to work themselves through 50 posts first. Anyway i dont think it would'nt kill anyone to have a new thread</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you as a regular already know what old threads are appropriate to be revived and what not, like take example the Tips&amp;Tricks (which eventually was made into a sticky one)<br />
<br />
But anyway... actually i have nothing to say anymore :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't think that that is how AVS does XOR, because then XOR would only result in a couple of colors being used, not the entire range that it does use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I just checked that, seems you're right<br />
<br />
I found this out by testing it with large text letters in many color constallations and in most cases this rule works. Maybe it processes some color constellations in a diffrent way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanx jheriko, i expected it to be a per byte xor and not a per bit xor - this explains why i got partially those results by playing around.</div></div><hr />
