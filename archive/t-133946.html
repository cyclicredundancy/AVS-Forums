      Since I am a female AVS artist, and I haven't noticed much females in AVS, I was wondering are there more, or I am alone? This seemed like the right place to ask. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Girl or boy, I suggest you just do like everyone else: make presets, post'em here for review if you want, and do the same for others. Don't be afraid to criticize, just don't crack down mindlessly ;).<br />
      <br />
      If you're new to AVS, try downloading some APEs. There is a link to a list thread in the Frequently Asked Questions (main forum). Start at the end and work your way backwards through the list, that way you get the most recent versions.<br />
      APEs allow you to do more effects with AVS (I've written a couple myself). Some are complicated, others are pretty easy, but they're all useful. And more toys to play with is always a good thing...<br />
      (You'll also need an APE to view a preset that uses it, so it's a good idea to download them anyway).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Daftcunt is a female avs artist, Atero is just confused, because she "overbithced" Atero :p (in fact i think Atero is a bit jealous ;))<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, female, male, what difference does it make? I know the chatting around here can be a little "guyish" with all the "The Bra" threads and such, but that shouldn't stop the grow of new artists, female or male :)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Besides im a little excited that there is female AVS-Artists, since now i can hit a girl with my AVS skills :D :blah: :D :blah:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know it doesn't make any difference, I was just curious :) And I wanted to shut my sister's mouth. She always says that avsing is too "guyish", and that she can't understand why I'm doing that.<br />
      <br />
      Unconed, thanks for your advices. I'm not too new to AVS, I just haven't posted here.<br />
      <br />
      And no, I'm not neither David Bowie, nor Woody Allen fan, I just liked the sound of the word "stardust" (and ZG is "Zagreb" for short, town where I live).</p>
