      I've noticed that my AVS chsnges presets after a set interval only when the random option is on. Can't it change them in order or is my AVS a little askew?:confused: Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">By "blue screen of death," do you mean the one that pops up whenever it can't read a CD or disk properly, and the one that sometimes gives illegal operations &amp; stuff like that? Could you explain what you mean by "can't change them in order or is my AVS a little askew?"<br />
      <br />
      If you think the problem lies in AVS, re-install Winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, that one. A fatal error or something like that.<br />

      About the change:<br />
      I know that if you have AVS running without an open editor window and a 'random' option turned on the presets change in a random order after a set number of seconds. That works. But you can turn off the 'random' option. It'll seem as though the presets are supposed to change in the order they are listed but they don't. That's what I mean.<br />
      I tried to download that program but after the attempt to open the .cab file the error popped up.</p>
