<div class="posttext">Does anyone know where the ElVis 3D superscope guide is. I searched all over the winamp.com plugins and couldn't find the pack it was it. So can someone post it or a link to it please :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">******************************<br />
*                            *<br />
*  SUPERSCOPES-3D by EL-VIS  *<br />
*                            *<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
First: &quot;Yes, I'm not a native speaker!&quot;<br />
Second: &quot;But I've tried my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea was to do some Superscopes in 3D. My first tries (_first3D_) were quite OK<br />
but not the real thing. So I got deeper into 3D-mathematics and I finally managed <br />
to develop a base setup for real 3D presets (_real3D_start.avs). <br />
<br />
<br />
Real 3D means:<br />
<br />
Every point of the scope has now 3 coordinates: x1, y1 and z1 <br />
(instead of x and y) which describe its position in the 3D-Room:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
           -y<br />
            |  +z<br />
            |  /<br />
            | /<br />
            |/<br />
-x ------------------- +x<br />
           /|0<br />
          / |<br />
         /  |<br />
       -z   |<br />
           +y<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So the scope becomes a real 3D-Object, which could be rotated around and<br />
moved along the three axes (x,y and z) of the 3D-Room. <br />
<br />
Finally the 3D-coordinates of the scope are translated into 2D-coordinates of the screen.<br />
<br />
Here's the explanation of the settings of real3D_start.avs by section:<br />
<br />
INIT_______________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
n=7; r=0.5; <br />
Just for this scope, which is a simple circle with a radius of 0.5 done in 7 steps.<br />
<br />
mx=0;my=0;mz=0;<br />
Use these to move the center/base of your scope along the axes.<br />
<br />
dst=2;<br />
Normally you don't need to change this. It's the distance for the 3D/2D-Translation.<br />
IMPORTANT: If you create, rotate or move a scope its z-values must not become lower <br />
than -dst =&gt; !!! z &gt;= -dst for all z !!! <br />
  <br />
rx=0;ry=0;rz=0;<br />
Initrotation around x,y and z-axis in degrees.<br />
<br />
rdx=1;rdy=1;rdz=1;<br />
Permanent rotation around axes in degrees/frame. Set these to zero to<br />
stop rotation.<br />
<br />
p=3.14159265;p2=2.0*p;p3=180/p<br />
You'll never need to change these<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
POINT______________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
x1=r*sin(p2*i);y1=0;z1=r*cos(p2*i);<br />
This is the 3D-Scope. Add your own scopes here by setting x1,y1 and z1. <br />
(Do not use x and y. They are generated in this section)<br />
<br />
(In fact the example is not really 3D because of y1=0, but as you see,<br />
it can be nicely rotated anyway) <br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
The length of input in all of the sections is limited. So keep your scope as<br />
short as possible. If the scope suddenly dissapears after a regular input you're<br />
F***ed!<br />
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Do not change anything else in this section:<br />
<br />
y2=y1*xc-z1*xs;z2=y1*xs+z1*xc;<br />
Rotation around x-axis<br />
<br />
x2=z2*ys+x1*yc;z3=z2*yc-x1*ys;<br />
Rotation around y-axis<br />
<br />
x3=x2*zc-y2*zs;y3=y2*zc+x2*zs;<br />
Rotation around z-axis<br />
<br />
x4=mx+x3;y4=my+y3;z4=mz+z3;<br />
Movement of center/base<br />
<br />
x=x4/(1+z4/dst);y=y4/(1+z4/dst);<br />
3D/2D-Translation<br />
<br />
FRAME______________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
This is a good place to setup additional movement for your scope. For Example:<br />
fr=fr+0.01;mz=1+sin(fr)<br />
will move the scope back and forward along the z-axis.<br />
<br />
Do not change these and add your input in front of them:<br />
<br />
rx=rx+rdx;ry=ry+rdy;rz=rz+rdz;<br />
Rotation per Frame<br />
<br />
xs=sin(rx/p3);ys=sin(ry/p3);zs=sin(rz/p3);xc=cos(rx/p3);yc=cos(ry/p3);zc=cos(rz/p3)<br />
Sinuses and cosinuses for rotation in point-section (to save space and increase<br />
performance).<br />
<br />
<br />
BEAT_______________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Setup the beat reaction of your scope. For example change the rotation speed by random<br />
like this:<br />
<br />
rdx=rand(3)+1;rdy=rand(3)+1;rdz=rand(3)+1<br />
<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
THAT'S ALL FOLKS !<br />

<br />
Our problem is that this forum is bogged down by posts that have been asked and answered many times.  First off, almost any n00b question is answered in the FAQ.  Second, n00bs tend to ignore the big, red letters telling them to search the forums.  After getting the same questions over and over and over again, all of us tend to get to the end of our rope because we are tired of answering the questions and it gives us less time to answer important questions and help each other perfect their packs.<br />
<br />
This is also fueled by regulars in these forums who are constantly making pointless, nonsensical posts or who say things without thinking or without knowing what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
We are also annoyed by people who come to this forum with a non-AVS post (i.e. the question about the playlist and the sentence game thread)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I let a lot go with atero as he was a useful member of teh team here and did sometimes help people out but way do we have to put up with this.<br />

Our problem is that this forum is bogged down by posts that have been asked and answered many times.Hey dude. Try responding to tech support questions for 3 years, hehe. We've got countless stickies/faq's, and a TSGH forum . . . but still we get the same questions over and over again.<br />
The best tip I can give you is to take a page out of mine and Sawg's books, and knock up a text file of links, so when someone asks the same old question, all you need to do is point them to the relevant thread.<br />
If it's answered in the faq, then knock up a simple copy+paste reply. Then it only takes a matter of seconds to post a reply.<br />
And be as cool, patient and courteous as hell, no matter how much it hurts, lol.Originally posted by Atero <br />
Gee, and you guys wonder why I resent the new mods so much.  Wonder what this is all about?  Talk to gonzoboy :mad: Now what was it I said in the other thread about prospective moderator material? ;)<br />
Remember, no-one is bigger than the forums themselves.<br />
Apparently, you've already been sent many private warnings about flaming members, and now I'm warning you in public. Persistent flaming will NOT be tolerated!<br />
Just to let the other good people here know, Atero posted a &quot;leaving&quot; message, where he blatently cursed and flamed other members and moderators in person.<br />
Not nice, not nice at all.<br />
As evidence, the thread was (re)moved.<br />
Trust me, you do NOT want to see it!<br />
<br />
Whether Atero leaves on his own accord or not, you'll be seeing a lot less of him around these parts in the not too distant future... sad, but true :(<br />
A temp ban means there's a second (conditional) chance.<br />
After that, it becomes permanent.</div></div><hr />
