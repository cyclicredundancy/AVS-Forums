      <p class="post-content">Its called raytracing, pixelcraft.<br />
      <br />
      Nice...it rotates a little too fast, and a better texture would be nice.</p>

      </blockquote>Yeah I know. It's the hardest thing to do in AVS IMO.

      <p class="post-content">I would try to make texture better if i only knew whats wrong with it myself too much... just tell me what would you like me to make better about this texture.<br />
      Hehe... maybe the rotation is too fast coz my pc is just too slow, anyways you can fix the iza,iya,iza=blablabla<br />
      thanks for replys<br />
      <br />
      raytracing is not THAT hard<br />
      <br />
      Wooops, i forgat to say that Sidd helped me a LOT creating this preset, thanks Sidd.</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually pixelcraft there's a lot of much harder stuff to do. there's just nobody out there willing to waste enough time with it to get it all down :D<br />
      <br />
      jaak: i'm actually getting king of tired with the zgm ripoffs...not saying that this isn't an achievement, but it's already been done by everyone else, so why bother? it's getting in that same area as the "discoball" style presets. i made some fucking kickass code for a pretty advanced one a while ago (in this format in fact; but as an actual maze)...but now that EVERYBODY is doing it i figure there's no point in doing my own. but like i said, it's cool that you're learning, so if you wanna go ahead and figure it out, more power to you. i'd just rather see you doing something more original, i guess :/</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's an ok preset.<br />
      <br />
      There are many things that are harder to do. A lot of them can't be done in avs for some reason or other(lack of coding structures, variable limit, whatever).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey, Atero, stfu with you'r zgm ripoff thing, i have never even tryed to understand this code, never even tryed to understand Raz'es code (well ive tryed but... yea, too weird for me :S)<br />
      This code was originaly just a box where tunnel passes throught two parallel planes, but then i just whanted to make it move, and thanks for GREAT help from Sidd it moves now, and this preset is here coz two ppl liked it very much.<br />
      So Atero if you dont like it shut you'r f*ck up, it's not about riping, it's about making a cool preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Originality also factors in. Sure, some of the newpicks are somewhat nice, and they were very cool a couple years ago. But now, everybody has done a preset like that, and they are boring. Anybody can do a water+mp+blitter feedback = disco party.<br />
      I didn't realize you didn't do most of this either, Jack. Try doing the code from scratch</p>

      <p class="post-content">way to misunderstand me jaak. i know what the preset was supposed to be, and i also know that if it weren't for unconed having done zgmIII you wouldn't have made this. i never accused you of stealing code once in that post, so fuck off.</p>
