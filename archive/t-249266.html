		Not sure if it was you that I told that it would be better if you would do a pack beacsue when you get your pack out it won't be that nice beacsue we all know your presets.<br />
<br />
Otherwise the preset is great, a little bit slow but a really nice work on the convoluition filter part. The only thing you should work on is trying to take some stuff out that really doesn't change it that much.<br />
<br />
I really don't see the point of the first DM. Why would you use alpha and don't check the blend button and I'm sure that there are some stuff in there that just slow down the preset. Otherwise it's great and I love the ideea. :)

If you check 'No movement(just blend)' then I think there is no need to check 'Blend' button itself, correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
Yes the framerate is very low and it's slow mostly because of 3 brightness filters and the second convolution filter but I think it still moves very nice and gentle:D.

			<strong>Suggestion</strong><br />
		
		

		you usgroup1 you really should lay off the speed hogging blurs and brightness's not to be a pain man but your work is starting to be as slow as mine used to be. and thats not good. i do have a suggestion for you. remove the first dm because i saw no change in the preset when removed then remove the blur and use a convo to make a more stable blur and remove at least 3 of the brightness's
