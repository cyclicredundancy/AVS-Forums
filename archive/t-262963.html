Re: 3d model practice<br />
<br />
Confusing, when you say 3d model I and other people assume an actual model, not a procedurally generated superscope.<br />

<br />
Movement codes for the scopes? &quot;codes&quot; is just as bad as &quot;internets&quot;. Codes are numbers and symbols strung together to represent something, code is the singular form of the above or is a string of instructions as part of a program/script. What sort of movement code? Moving the points of the scope around independently, as a group, maybe even code from a Trans / Movement?<br />

<br />
You remembered someoneelse's idea, copied it, but somehow didn't steal it. You could be correct if not(true) is allowed to equal false...<br />

Maybe not contradicting yourself repeatedly would allow people to make a meaningful reply to your post... I would check out the presets but I am at work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks though, for consuming 5 mins of my work time. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I decided to get my fingers dancing and started coding this beauty. I've pretty much ran out of ideas to use for this.<br />
also please laugh at my pathetic attempt on the stick figure.<br />
<br />
let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You look really happy there playing the Piano. :D<br />
What a smile you have got there. :) Like it.<br />
You could make the flames of the candles a bit more lively.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Forgot to check this out, sorry. Will do so when I get home.<br />
<br />
Sounds interesting though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The original preset is pretty good, it could use some camera movement though. The background seems a bit random too, it would be nice if there was something to complement the model.<br />
<br />
The stick man sitting at the piano is pretty awesome, even if it lacks any culling and solid rendering etc... I like the method you have used for the flames on the candles, simple but effective. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i've attempted some culling on the person and the piano.<br />
and improved the flames a bit.</div></div><hr />
