      <p class="post-content"><strong>3d model practice</strong><br />
      I've been busy and after i watched NemoOranges Shadowplay preset. i borrowed the movement codes for the scopes and well i then remembered the post about the preset that looks like a Piano with working keys. so i decided to work in 3d with the movement codes and this is pretty much what i have so far. let me know what you think.<br />
      also no stealing the idea k.</p>

      </blockquote>Confusing, when you say 3d model I and other people assume an actual model, not a procedurally generated superscope.<br />

      </blockquote>Movement codes for the scopes? "codes" is just as bad as "internets". Codes are numbers and symbols strung together to represent something, code is the singular form of the above or is a string of instructions as part of a program/script. What sort of movement code? Moving the points of the scope around independently, as a group, maybe even code from a Trans / Movement?<br />

      Thanks though, for consuming 5 mins of my work time. :)

      <p class="post-content"><strong>yay!!</strong><br />
      I decided to get my fingers dancing and started coding this beauty. I've pretty much ran out of ideas to use for this.<br />
      also please laugh at my pathetic attempt on the stick figure.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">You look really happy there playing the Piano. :D<br />
      What a smile you have got there. :) Like it.<br />
      You could make the flames of the candles a bit more lively.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The original preset is pretty good, it could use some camera movement though. The background seems a bit random too, it would be nice if there was something to complement the model.<br />
      <br />
      The stick man sitting at the piano is pretty awesome, even if it lacks any culling and solid rendering etc... I like the method you have used for the flames on the candles, simple but effective. :)</p>
