      I propose a group (you might call it a club) of AVS elites, which, if formed, would be headed by UnConeD. Who's with me, everybody?! *bubbly PE teacher prancing aboutishness*<br />
      <br />
      PS: I know about AVSociety - and there's a difference between being elite and being part of AVSociety. A very large gap, in fact.<br />
      <br />
      PPS: If I'm being stupid, just ignore me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Who decides who gets to join? Once you do join, what would you do? What would set this group apart from the others?<br />
      <br />
      If such a group were formed, t'would be neat for them to advise nullsoft as to what goes into the next version of AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was thinking along the lines of a preset audition to decide who gets to join.<br />
      <br />
      The group would share knowledge, make, critique, and optimize/remix each others' presets, and possibly, as you suggested, advise NS on what to do with AVS (like, make a new version!!!).<br />
      <br />
      This group would sort of be a 'badge of honor' to those who know AVS better than the rest (if that sounds a bit pretentious, it wasn't supposed to be...)</p>
