		Hey, what ya'll think of this 'visual' preset?<br />
<br />
(HINT: Look at it for at least 2000 frames)

		So soothing... so relaxing... I can watch this (I wish I could, damn what-seems-to-be-hyperactivity) all day long... The Sun in this preset is the closest to real one that I've seen, too :D

		Wow... verra nice. :up: Too bad about the slow speed :(<br />
<br />
For some reason at 320x240 I'm getting some ugly lines that aren't the at 320x200 any ideas?

That's cool how the sun sets behind the ocean...Nice use of the superscope...One problem, Why does it move left to right when moving?

		Oh my God...You are t3h ub3r-1337 zevensoft<br />
<br />
What does the very first superscope do?  It's the same as the three in the last effect list I think, but if it isn't, what do they do?

		The first superscope is the actual sun with rays, the rest are lens flares. The sun looks HEAPS better when theres music playing.<br />
<br />
And the lines effect can be rectifed by adding &quot;n=h*2+2&quot; to the 'per frame' parts of all the superscopes.<br />
<br />
And the reason it moves from left to right, is because it's in sync with the camera.

		duh...I am just curious, is it possible to make a randomiser that can be made to make it choose from straight, left-right, clockwise barrel roll, or counter-clockwise barrel roll?

		Any randomizing would have to be seeded based on spectrum values. It is possible, but I'd rather code a new preset from scratch than add to that monstrosity.<br />
<br />
That above was basically an invite for anyone to modify it and yadda yadda include credit blah blah.

		goddamn that looks phat. shame about the low fps, but thats what happens when you cram so many different effects into a preset. beats the cack out of both of my ocean presets.

		i have to say that slowness is why i don't plan (if you excuse geometry co-ordinates) my presets anymore, every preset i have planned out (the only one i released of these was predator eye view in pack 1 which i still think is my best ever preset) has ended up with less than 2fps because i tend to go way overboard and make something immensly attractive but unreactive and processor intensive. I think that that could be what happened with this one too, to a lesser extent, which is why it looks so nice.

		gah...why does everyone think you need to seed it on the getspec and getosc functions?  that's a really bad idea considering mono songs where you still only get 1 degree of rotatation.<br />
this method ensures you get psuedo-random numbers without getting repetetive movement:<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
mr1=mr1+n1;<br />
mr2=mr2+n2; ...<br />
beat:<br />
r1=sin(mr1);<br />
r2=sin(mr2); ...<br />
<br />
where nx are arbitary numbers with many decimals

		Well I was referring to the Nuclear Warfare presets mainly, and some more unfinished stuff that I have lying around, which I won't post (yet) :).

		FLAW:  When listening to my music watching your preset, I noticed that when the camera goes under the water it restarts it's L-R pattern from the center, and it's pretty choppy.

		You know, I am a HUGE fan of Landscape presets<br />
<br />
(like my SmokingSun one; dont worry, I'll attach it :))<br />
<br />
Damn fine job zeven (can i call you that?)<br />
<br />
well, again, _really_ fine job, reminds me of the 3-D part of the Game Gear version of Ecco: the dolphin.<br />
<br />
Execpt its dynamic to my music and doesnt look like crap and has lens flair.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have landscape presets?<br />
i enjoy them immensely

		I've made shedloads of them, if you've downloaded my avs packs you can see them all (about 8 or 9 i think) i don't want to post them here because they all use pictures. The best one that I've ever made is Stormfront II in Pack III.

		Bah... procedural textures may seem like a good idea but it is so much easier to just use a picture, even if they do make it slower. I know that I am probably the laziest coder around, I never even finish half of my avs presets!<br />
<br />
I can see the benefits of procedural textures and in a way a lot of AVS is procedural texture generating, just in a different way.
