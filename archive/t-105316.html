<div class="posttext">Hey, what ya'll think of this 'visual' preset?<br />
<br />
(HINT: Look at it for at least 2000 frames)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So soothing... so relaxing... I can watch this (I wish I could, damn what-seems-to-be-hyperactivity) all day long... The Sun in this preset is the closest to real one that I've seen, too :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow... verra nice. :up: Too bad about the slow speed :(<br />
<br />
For some reason at 320x240 I'm getting some ugly lines that aren't the at 320x200 any ideas?</div></div><hr />

That's cool how the sun sets behind the ocean...Nice use of the superscope...One problem, Why does it move left to right when moving?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh my God...You are t3h ub3r-1337 zevensoft<br />
<br />
What does the very first superscope do?  It's the same as the three in the last effect list I think, but if it isn't, what do they do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th September 2002, 00:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The first superscope is the actual sun with rays, the rest are lens flares. The sun looks HEAPS better when theres music playing.<br />
<br />
And the lines effect can be rectifed by adding &quot;n=h*2+2&quot; to the 'per frame' parts of all the superscopes.<br />
<br />
And the reason it moves from left to right, is because it's in sync with the camera.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">duh...I am just curious, is it possible to make a randomiser that can be made to make it choose from straight, left-right, clockwise barrel roll, or counter-clockwise barrel roll?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wish I knew some way to help you optimize this a bit, but I don't :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th September 2002, 09:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Any randomizing would have to be seeded based on spectrum values. It is possible, but I'd rather code a new preset from scratch than add to that monstrosity.<br />
<br />
That above was basically an invite for anyone to modify it and yadda yadda include credit blah blah.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">goddamn that looks phat. shame about the low fps, but thats what happens when you cram so many different effects into a preset. beats the cack out of both of my ocean presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very high eye-candy factor, but shame about the speed ;). I've created my own share of slow-but-beautiful presets, so I don't mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i have to say that slowness is why i don't plan (if you excuse geometry co-ordinates) my presets anymore, every preset i have planned out (the only one i released of these was predator eye view in pack 1 which i still think is my best ever preset) has ended up with less than 2fps because i tend to go way overboard and make something immensly attractive but unreactive and processor intensive. I think that that could be what happened with this one too, to a lesser extent, which is why it looks so nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">gah...why does everyone think you need to seed it on the getspec and getosc functions?  that's a really bad idea considering mono songs where you still only get 1 degree of rotatation.<br />
this method ensures you get psuedo-random numbers without getting repetetive movement:<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
mr1=mr1+n1;<br />
mr2=mr2+n2; ...<br />
beat:<br />
r1=sin(mr1);<br />
r2=sin(mr2); ...<br />
<br />
where nx are arbitary numbers with many decimals</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well I was referring to the Nuclear Warfare presets mainly, and some more unfinished stuff that I have lying around, which I won't post (yet) :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">FLAW:  When listening to my music watching your preset, I noticed that when the camera goes under the water it restarts it's L-R pattern from the center, and it's pretty choppy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You know, I am a HUGE fan of Landscape presets<br />
<br />
(like my SmokingSun one; dont worry, I'll attach it :))<br />
<br />
Damn fine job zeven (can i call you that?)<br />
<br />
well, again, _really_ fine job, reminds me of the 3-D part of the Game Gear version of Ecco: the dolphin.<br />
<br />
Execpt its dynamic to my music and doesnt look like crap and has lens flair.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have landscape presets?<br />
i enjoy them immensely</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've made shedloads of them, if you've downloaded my avs packs you can see them all (about 8 or 9 i think) i don't want to post them here because they all use pictures. The best one that I've ever made is Stormfront II in Pack III.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bah... procedural textures may seem like a good idea but it is so much easier to just use a picture, even if they do make it slower. I know that I am probably the laziest coder around, I never even finish half of my avs presets!<br />
<br />
I can see the benefits of procedural textures and in a way a lot of AVS is procedural texture generating, just in a different way.</div></div><hr />
