<div class="posttext">losses, losers and more<br />
gain of life's pleasures <br />
cohorts listenin behind the door<br />
to a life, sheltered in<br />
less than 0 in me<br />
all my walls falling down<br />
pains aloft misery<br />
<br />
im sure that the lessons were learned<br />
im sure that the punishments went well deserved<br />
<br />
by the pawn, in the plan<br />
taste of shit, bitterness<br />
walk from me, everything systematically<br />
<br />
come on<br />
you're the one<br />
dredge up shit inside of me<br />
my pointless life of nothing<br />
tell me what its suppose to be<br />
tell me who i'm suppose to be<br />
tell me what it takes to ascend<br />
tell me what it takes to live<br />
<br />
patience, pleasures and rewards<br />
come in due time, i stare at the sun<br />
im bored, of a life, meaningless<br />
soaking up all of me<br />
like the cross you worship<br />
life is loss, look at me<br />
<br />
i'm sure that someday we'll wake up<br />
i'm sure that someday we'll wake from the dream<br />
<br />
of success and focus, tunneling<br />
to the light, glowing deep inside of me<br />
your taunting, i wake up<br />
<br />
come on<br />
you're the one<br />
to dredge up shit inside of me<br />
my pointless life of nothing<br />
tell me what its suppose to be<br />
tell me who i'm suppose to be<br />
tell me what it takes to ascend<br />
tell me what it takes to live<br />
tell me now<br />
<br />
pain, misery, distress, dismayal<br />
nowhere, depressed, idiot, failure<br />
in me....calling.....man im the<br />
loser, loser, loser<br />
in me....who i am...in me<br />
<br />
don't feel sorry <br />
don't feel sorry for me <br />
don't need your sympathy or empathy<br />
don't need your sympathy inside of me <br />
don't need your sympathy or empathy<br />
don't need your sympathy inside of me<br />
don't feel sorry <br />
don't feel sorry for me <br />
<br />
<br />
Come on I know <br />
you're the one <br />
numb to feelings inside of me <br />
why I've seized my vision <br />
don't need you to tell me who to be <br />
don't need you to tell me what to be <br />
don't need you to tell me how to ascend <br />
don't need you to tell me how to live <br />

Away from the games<br />

Dude, the preset gives my seisures. <br />
<br />
If you want constructive critisism, just post a preset and give a short explaination. If, however, you want people to think your an idiot, say stuff like: &quot;stare at one for a while even if its slow, you'll start to see the faces that haunt my soul&quot;<br />

<div class="posttext">:blah: yo i found out that this set doesnt want to work for everybody, yeah ban me i really could care less for this life is meaningless compared to my &quot;real&quot; life offline. im not sure if its winamp 5 that plays it differently or if it has to do with faster processor speeds f*kkit B*tCh im a n00b or however in the hell you ppl say it. either way it wont work for everybody, maybe the power of the preset has rejected your fragile phyche since most of this preset was written while in a self induced trace chantting the manra of my well being, or was it the one for world destruction and clensing, oh wait i know it was the one for the consumption of souls. you know i dont mind being critisized it helps for change but when being compared to another who lives a totally different life than me, who has a whole different midset and intellegence level that the one rambling on with these incoherent rantings, one that obviously wasnt raised in the same country, praise allah  :mad:  :hang:  &lt;{NAILED INSIDE MY HEAD};?:mad: :hang:    it raises the hatred level that i've gained from a few sessions in this created little world that everyone seems to be sucked into. i dont see how a life behind a keyboard viewing little images and text typing in mathmatical code and the computer languages creating FAKE SHIT really could be called a life. it has nothing to compare to a real life where you go out and live life. sure u may get paid for the application of your knowledge. it just feeds more into this little world making it bigger. i may live a shitty life but i wouldnt trade it for 10 hours in this shit. anyway im out i believe i've said too much. :weird: <br />

just go far away and be smalll<br />
run far away and be small<br />
go lie in a hole and be small<br />

if you really think you got what it takes to be me<br />
then walk a mile in this skin<br />

and now for my favorite quotes<br />
<br />
<br />
The Nine Satanic Statements <br />
I  Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence! <br />
<br />
II  Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams! <br />
<br />
III  Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit! <br />
<br />
IV  Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates! <br />
<br />
V  Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek! <br />
<br />
VI  Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires! <br />
<br />
VII  Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all fours, who, because of his &quot;divine spiritual and intellectual development, has become the most vicious animal of all! <br />
<br />
VIII  Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification! <br />
<br />
IX  Satan is the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years! <br />
<br />
<br />
From the Satanic Bible <br />

<div class="posttext">lol@ the teenager sh*t yea i've heard of constructive critism but when being compared to someone with a background far less advanced than that of a home bred american and all this being cracked on bullsh*t and u expected me not to respond ........F**k that im a grown man not some lil kid to be kicked around by some overegotistal f**khead....no offence to all the real f**kheads. for all the flooding? done out of pure anger at being scoffed at by some white horse and silver spoon acting assmonkey, i would have used an edit button if there was one down at the bottom next to the quick reply box.... but it is good to see that some the ppl up there in the chain arent as ignorent as most and remembered what constructive is. so i have no prob with u Lobo ur cool man and d-12 i feel for u if ur a regular u must listen to all thier sh*t everytime u post, no offence about what i have said or what im sure is going to come up i just dont agree with be compared to anyone, im no one but me, i dont see things like anyone else i live my own life my way. for a couple tho it seems that they forgotten the fact that there are ppl who dont do this for a living and dont have every waking moment to spend on working up something to please everyone else....i made this preset for me to watch while listening to the heavy truths that are sung to me by mudvayne...i made them in my spare time to put myself into a comelike state....maybe the call it epilepsy i dunno but anyway i use the presets to meditiate and call forth the spirits to aid me in thu life...and i chose to share this preset with everyone so i expected a little destru... i mean constructive critism....but what goods it going to do to belittle me and out to make me like a fool....i do a good enough job at it...  and all thats going to accomplish is raising my anger level. yea so u can go ahead and ban me it would be an honor to no longer be in the presence of a bunch of maggots who have nothing better to do than feast on a newbie... than down other ppls sh*t however insignifcant it may seem to you...it may mean the world to other ppl....like the creator maybe....and maybe this creator doesnt have the sanity left for another moment spent amongst all the highheads, yeah the hot air is beginning to fill the room....getting hard to breathe....im done and out of this post......maybe u'll see me around....maybe i'll disturb u with another mindless piece of sh*t for u to throw mud at. l8r f*kkrz</div></div><hr />

Too lazy to warn you VIA PM, so here it is:<br />

You're warned!<br />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, i do not have the time nor intrest to read all that flaming through, but i can very well understand if people don't like your postings mUdVaYnEmAn420. We here at the AVS forums are only interested in these things:<br />
<br />
1) Watching AVS<br />
2) Making AVS<br />
3) Talking about AVS<br />
<br />
Anything else just doesn't intrest us not a bit one, usually we just ignore them, but this time you posted several posts and made several dead thread revivals and pretty much talked about something that didn't intrest us.<br />
<br />
In short: Im not surprised at all if there is going to be a lot of bannings if this continues, who's going to be the bigger man and stop first?</div></div><hr />
