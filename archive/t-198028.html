      Has anyone made a AVS that acts as a slide show of pics from your own pc? (e.g. my pictures)??<br />
      <br />
      If anyone has or has somethin similar could you give me an email and a copy of it.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't think anyone has made anything like that. But why would you want something like that in AVS anyway? The sheer manual work that is required everytime you want to change the pictures for example is quite a lot (assuming were talking here about 50-100 pictures per load) AVS can't just magically search for your picture directory and then use them in the preset, nooo in AVS everyting needs to be done manually. And that's why it really isn't a viable option for something like this.</p>

      You'd better use another program than AVS

      <p class="post-content">Or if you have XP just put all the pics in a directory, open the first one and press the 'view as slideshow' button at the bottom. You cant control the duration of pictures but its good enough for pr0...er... corporate presentations and stuff.</p>
