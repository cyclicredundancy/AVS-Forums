solve for n in terms of k, x, and y.<br />
<br />
i think i'm going to cry.  i really want a solution for that but i'm too stupid.  anyone willing to help me out with it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">As far as I know, you're not gonna solve that.  You can approximate it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Like they said - I'm pretty sure that one isn't solvable - check on matlab or mathematica or maple or something, but I don't think it is solvable.  You will have to do numeric approximations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">skupers</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st March 2004, 08:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I tried as well. Anyone else thinks is looks a lot like Fermat's Last Theorem. I got Shock Value's formula and also this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
n = - log ( k^-n + abs(y)^n * abs(x)^-n * k^-n ) / log (x)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Solving for x, y and k is easy though, but I guess you don't need that. I think you need to factor abs(x)^n + abs(y)^n, but I don't know how to do it. I did find a (crappy) method for splitting k^n - abs(y)^n in different parts, but that doesn't help at all. Maybe anyone here finds it interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
k^n - abs(y)^n = ( k^(n-1) - abs(y)^(n-1) )*( k + abs(y) ) - ( k^(n-2) - abs(y)^(n-2) ) * k * abs(y)<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be very interested in hearing the solution. Maybe you could post it on a math forum.</div></div><hr />

/me is stupid and ignorant and stupid<br />
<br />
and yes this is for a preset.  i tried it on my ti-89 but it didn't work - but then again there's a lot of things that the 89 is bad at, like working right...anyone here have mathematica?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes, but it has a very similar form. x^n + y^n = z^n<br />
<br />
Where did you find this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nic01 is right. Take a look at this article (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Superellipse.html).<br />
<br />
The formula can be rewritten to:<br />
<br />
(abs(x)/k)^n + (abs(y)/k)^n -1 = 0<br />
<br />
Maybe this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, <br />
<br />
abs(x)^n + abs(y)^n = k^n<br />
abs(x)^n/k^n + abs(y)^n/k^n = k^n/k^n<br />
(abs(x)/k)^n + (abs(y)/k)^n = 1<br />
(abs(x)/k)^n + (abs(y)/k)^n - 1 = 0<br />
<br />
It works except for k=0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK, I asked my math teacher and he didn't know a method to solve it. He also said that he didn't know if it was impossible. He did help make the formula easier.<br />
<br />
abs(x)^n + abs(y)^n = k^n<br />
abs(x)^n/k^n + abs(y)^n/k^n = k^n/k^n<br />
(abs(x)/k)^n + (abs(y)/k)^n = 1<br />
<br />
this can be written as the seemingly easier calculation:<br />
a^n + b^n = 1<br />
where a = abs(x)/k and b = abs(y)/k<br />
<br />
I've attached a plot of the above equation on my graphing calc:<br />
the x-axis is a from 0 to 1, with a scale of 0.1<br />
the y-axis is n from 0 to 5, with a scale of 0.5<br />
the bottom line: b=0.25<br />
the middle line: b=0.5<br />
the top line: b=0.75</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">After another long talk with my math teacher, we have concluded this it's probably unsolvable. This theory is supported by this Ask Dr. Math article (http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52879.html). I haven't found a real proof that it is impossible to solve, but I think it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*cough* approximation *cough*<br />
<br />
Depending on what he wants to do he could use newton/raphson or whittaker or just good old Euler's method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">This is a very hard problem... the only way i can think of solving it is numerically by using either n-r/whittaker. You can also solve it by using log expansions but this is also an iterative process and is difficult and more expensive in terms of divisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UIUC85</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th March 2004, 00:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well if he's just doing some 2D stuff he could use Euler's method as well to inch along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">BTW what i can tell you is that this is 100% insoluble in a finite fashion due to the use of real powers. The definition of a generic non integer power can be given only in terms of an infinite series... whether its some clever sum of sines and cosines or something based on e or calculus, also the instant you use log you are playing with an iterative solutions whether you realise it or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">eeps.  sorry guys, i've been busy the past few days and i've forgotten to check this thread...<br />
<br />
anyway, basically what i'm looking for is, given a point (x,y), find the superellipse of power n:<br />
|x|^n+|y|^n=r<br />
which would intersect that point.<br />
<br />
and i'm thinking the more that i look at it that i shouldn't have had k^n at all in the first place, so it should probably be rewritten as:<br />
|x|^n+|y|^n=1<br />
i doubt that'd make it possible to solve, but i guess it's worth a try....<br />
<br />
thanks guys :)</div></div><hr />

I think you need to factor abs(x)^n + abs(y)^n, but I don't know how to do it. <br />
<br />
You can find a factor with the Striling-formula:<br />
<br />
n! = sqrt(2*pi*n)*(n^n)*(e^(-n))<br />
<br />
Don't know if this helps to find a solution but I thought to post it.</div></div><hr />
