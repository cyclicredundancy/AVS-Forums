<div class="posttext">Hiya. This is my first post. Hope you like these two:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Primacy v1.0<br />
written by Cawifre<br />
----------------------------------<br />
This one started out as just the three moving particles mixing their colors and expanding on beat. I kept building on that, and eventually I dropped the expand on beat and shifted all of the audio visualization to a SuperScope. I wrote a dampening script for the SuperScope that smooths the curve against an arbitrary number of preceding points. Using only 5 points gave me the effect I wanted for this. The script can be refactored to use a fixed number of preceding points to improve efficiency. Keeping it dynamic can eat processor time rather quickly at higher settings.<br />
<br />
This is the first visualization I have made that I feel is good enough to upload. Enjoy the colors.<br />

Dark Voices v1.0<br />
written by Cawifre<br />
----------------------------------<br />
This is only a slight render mode tweak on Primacy v1.0, but I liked the results so much I thought it deserved its own spotlight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Technically (well superscope-wise at least) pretty good for a first preset released.<br />
However visually rather n00b/dated.<br />
<br />
The preset would run much faster if you didn't use so many Effect lists and Buffers.<br />
They're the real expensive things here. (Although I do start to see fps dipping with a value of 60+ for in the superscope as you warned.)<br />
<br />
So... yeah.<br />
I think you need to work on your presentation skills mostly, maybe have a look at some packs by popular authors.<br />
Texer II and Dynamic Movements are worth looking into using too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd welcome you to the AVS scene but it's basically been and gone.<br />
<br />
(I'm sure/hoping someone else will come along and pass verdict too.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the input, QOAL. Yes, my programming skills are definitely more developed than my artistic skills. Dynamic Movements is actually my next focus. (Gah. I've been playing FF XIII - the word focus freaks me out a bit right now.)<br />
<br />
I was unaware that Effects Lists and Buffers were such a cycle pit. Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes Incubus, I've only released one pack (few years ago, just before AVS died), with some singles floating about the forums. I have a Second edition of the pack kinda almost ready, and have done for a while, I rarely get new ideas that I can make.</div></div><hr />
