		Hiya. This is my first post. Hope you like these two:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Primacy v1.0<br />
written by Cawifre<br />
----------------------------------<br />
This one started out as just the three moving particles mixing their colors and expanding on beat. I kept building on that, and eventually I dropped the expand on beat and shifted all of the audio visualization to a SuperScope. I wrote a dampening script for the SuperScope that smooths the curve against an arbitrary number of preceding points. Using only 5 points gave me the effect I wanted for this. The script can be refactored to use a fixed number of preceding points to improve efficiency. Keeping it dynamic can eat processor time rather quickly at higher settings.<br />
<br />
This is the first visualization I have made that I feel is good enough to upload. Enjoy the colors.<br />
<br />

Dark Voices v1.0<br />
written by Cawifre<br />
----------------------------------<br />
This is only a slight render mode tweak on Primacy v1.0, but I liked the results so much I thought it deserved its own spotlight.

		Hi,<br />
<br />
Technically (well superscope-wise at least) pretty good for a first preset released.<br />
However visually rather n00b/dated.<br />
<br />
The preset would run much faster if you didn't use so many Effect lists and Buffers.<br />
They're the real expensive things here. (Although I do start to see fps dipping with a value of 60+ for in the superscope as you warned.)<br />
<br />
So... yeah.<br />
I think you need to work on your presentation skills mostly, maybe have a look at some packs by popular authors.<br />
Texer II and Dynamic Movements are worth looking into using too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd welcome you to the AVS scene but it's basically been and gone.<br />
<br />
(I'm sure/hoping someone else will come along and pass verdict too.)

		Thanks for the input, QOAL. Yes, my programming skills are definitely more developed than my artistic skills. Dynamic Movements is actually my next focus. (Gah. I've been playing FF XIII - the word focus freaks me out a bit right now.)<br />
<br />
I was unaware that Effects Lists and Buffers were such a cycle pit. Thanks for the tip.

		Yes Incubus, I've only released one pack (few years ago, just before AVS died), with some singles floating about the forums. I have a Second edition of the pack kinda almost ready, and have done for a while, I rarely get new ideas that I can make.
