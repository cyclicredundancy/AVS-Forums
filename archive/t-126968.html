<div class="posttext">In the March issue of PCFormat there is a half page article on AVS including links to winamp.com and small reviews of eight AVS packs - Whacko AVS, EL-VIS HISTORY, I wanna be Frank Nagel, Tuggummi Innovation, AV Antholology, Why-Eye Full Circle, Danjoe's PIXel and Jheriko J7. Also the coverdisc features the complete works of UnConeD and myself along with three why-eye.org packs, EL-VIS HISTORY, PIXel and Tuggummi Innovation. For those of you who wish to see the article I'll scan it when I get my scanner working... for those with less patience you can order a copy of PCF from www.futurepublishing.co.uk the article can be found on page 134.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, that's awesome.  I like all those packs except for the whyeye ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Finally avs gets some attention...Maybe the nullsoft team wakes up and tryes to finish(or start...) avs 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd March 2003, 21:11</div></div>

<div class="posttext">I doubt that will happen anytime soon.  They have too much on their plate right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think you said this,cant remember but some guys who know coding and know how avs works should give nullsoft a hand.Maybe we can all help to improve the next studio...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ehm...no offense, i think you're a great avser - but i don't think you should be put next to unconed (i.e. complete works on the CD)...not that i think anyone else should, mind you :)<br />
<br />
and avsociety anthology...that was a piece of shit.  hardly any of the presets were watchable-- why in god's name is it on an avs article in the first place? :weird:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd March 2003, 06:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">WOW! I can't really say nothing else! I wish i pwn3d i credit card so i could order it... It's not an age question you all know that, i just don't have one :D<br />
<br />
/me goes sit in a corner biting his fingernails and waiting for jheriko to post the scan...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">tried to get an issue, but the international press section still had the february issue :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">lol your newsagents are slow, here we get next months issue of all magazines.<br />
<br />
And in case you are wondering, I am a cheap bastard and cannot afford that magazine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Yathosho</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd March 2003, 11:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well, it's a foreign magazine for me, so i'm lucky that one *can* get it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">skupers</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd March 2003, 16:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, cool. I would be very interested in reading that article.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th March 2003, 01:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yup its a bit low quality but i had to sacrifice a little to fit the file size limit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice that Winamp/AVS is getting some recognition, but they used some of the worst presets IMO.  Never really liked Jacob's Ladder for instance - should have gone with dreamtime for el-vis.<br />
<br />
*me farts in their general direction at them calling UnConeD bizarre*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th March 2003, 03:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jacob's ladder is actually pretty good (to me)<br />
<br />
One of the things I like the most about the article : &quot;An entire community of coders&quot; =P (Well, I can't code :) ) (That and the fact that it regards us as a whole community. Now to get 10+ more people...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">rats... i was hoping they would have displayed on of my own presets... oh well</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">what issue is this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow cool, they called me stunning :igor: I guess they just fainted after seeing the awful Innovation pack... which i think is total crap generally and i still can't understand why the hell it has so many downloads *sigh*<br />
<br />
*Unleashes satanic powers towards them for calling UnConeD Bizarre*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i think they mean advanced vis studio, wtf with calling unconed bizzarre? me sending a letter bomb!  i feel flatered to be called a &quot;coder&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ummh good to see the exposure. :)<br />
Probably mean a whole new wave of newbie questions (read the FAQ)though. :);)<br />
<br />
I will try and have a look later on today. <br />
<br />
I am surprised that there was no discussion by thje article author here. We probably could have helped more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah... by changing the title of the magazine to AVSFormat and filling it with 200 pages of AVS articles. :D</div></div><hr />
