      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS featured in PCFormat magazine</strong><br />
      In the March issue of PCFormat there is a half page article on AVS including links to winamp.com and small reviews of eight AVS packs - Whacko AVS, EL-VIS HISTORY, I wanna be Frank Nagel, Tuggummi Innovation, AV Antholology, Why-Eye Full Circle, Danjoe's PIXel and Jheriko J7. Also the coverdisc features the complete works of UnConeD and myself along with three why-eye.org packs, EL-VIS HISTORY, PIXel and Tuggummi Innovation. For those of you who wish to see the article I'll scan it when I get my scanner working... for those with less patience you can order a copy of PCF from <a href="http://www.futurepublishing.co.uk" target="_blank">www.futurepublishing.co.uk</a> the article can be found on page 134.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ehm...no offense, i think you're a great avser - but i don't think you should be put next to unconed (i.e. complete works on the CD)...not that i think anyone else should, mind you :)<br />
      <br />
      and avsociety anthology...that was a piece of shit. hardly any of the presets were watchable-- why in god's name is it on an avs article in the first place? :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice that Winamp/AVS is getting some recognition, but they used some of the worst presets IMO. Never really liked Jacob's Ladder for instance - should have gone with dreamtime for el-vis.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Jacob's ladder is actually pretty good (to me)<br />
      <br />
      One of the things I like the most about the article : "An entire community of <b>coders</b>" =P (Well, I can't code :) ) (That and the fact that it regards us as a whole community. Now to get 10+ more people...)</p>
