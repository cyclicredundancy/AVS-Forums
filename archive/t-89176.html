      <p class="post-content">what i mean is, in your AVS preset editor you only get like spinning triangles and fountains and stuff like that.Then u have the options of giving them water effects and and bumpy effects.My question is, is there anywhere out there that you can download more affects?<br />
      And i forgot to ask how to put pictures in the "picture option" because i WAS TRYING to get a bmp image i made on standard microsoft paint into my AVS plug-in.<br />
      Please help a newbie out.<br />
      thanx in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well in that case the AVS forum should be albe to inform you more but you cannot have any new effect as you mean. APE's can be added but that is another story.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway moving to a more relevant forum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you wanna get more effets, suggest them in the wish lish forum and someone may make and APE for ya. (don't count on it though, takes more work than I'd put into it)<br />
      <br />
      As for the pictre add a render/picture, put the picter in your AVS dir, then select it from the dropdown list.</p>
