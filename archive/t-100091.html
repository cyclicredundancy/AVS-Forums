		Intro - I don't see anything... After deleting the text, it reveals an average preset...<br />
<br />
The Race - The screen &quot;whites out&quot; some times at different colors... the preset itself isn't very (and aesthetically) good anyways :( <br />
<br />
I Am Still Alive - I don't know... removing the texts to get rid of the blue reveals the real preset... which doesn't really look good... Nice effort though.<br />
<br />
80's Style - Aah, an eyecandy... I like it more with the Custom BPM turned off.<br />
<br />
Colored Dots - Crank the smooth transitions 1/3 way to fastest, instead of all the way to slowest. A bit nicer that way... Otherwise we just have floating particles.<br />
<br />
Mad - Gah, whites out to a color too often... I liked the effect when it's not all the same color though...<br />
<br />
Ring Of Colored Fire - Too dark =/ Needs some improvements...<br />
<br />
Overall : 2.5-3.5 Stars out of 5...<br />
<br />
You experimented a lot... try to make them look good, and you shouldn't have much problem getting better.

			<strong>Looks good for a starter</strong><br />
		
		

		Looks good for a first pack, how long have you been doing this?<br />
<br />
The intro worked on my pc, I don't know what Nic's problem was,but everything looks OK over here...<br />
I agree about what Nic said, they don't look like the ones created by the people who are doing this for a job... but that would get boring. I like the fact that you really have a own style, something I REALLY miss by grandmasters such as El-Vis, UnConeD and the others (sorry for not-mentioning you all) it's just all the same (sorry if I hurt your feelings guys, but I have to stay honest)<br />
<br />
Try experimentating with custom movements, that'll increase the looks of your presets a lot, start easy with some sin, cos, tan formula's<br />
look around in my pack, it's downloadable on the forum<br />
<br />
Greetings,<br />

		Nice presets... I have a few comments though:<br />
<br />
- Some of presets are quite dark... I would suggest you make them brighter (ring of colored fire, race).<br />
<br />
- The text in your intro is very small. Maybe you should use a larger font size.<br />
<br />
- Try experimenting with colors more. When you use the colorfade, you automatically create a 'rainbow' preset. By using unique tones and multiplications, you can shift this color palette into something different and cool. For example, a unique tone with additive blue results in icey tones.<br />
<br />
- I didn't quite like the text on &quot;i am still alive&quot;. The background is neat though, try doing more with it.

		Intro - Same problem.  The text function has a horrible glitch that fills the blue channel slightly, so additive blend doesn't work right, and replace blend makes the entire screen black (except for the slight blue fill and the text).  To be used sparingly.<br />
<br />
The Race - Sorry, but this idea is incredibly over used.  And I happen to know about hyperspace, and this isn't it :P<br />
<br />
I am Still Alive - Same text problem, and no noticable music response.<br />
<br />
80's Style - Looks almost exactly like something I did a while back for my 'Drugs' pack...please, don't go looking for it, guys.  But if you do, I believe the preset was named 'Took an Acid Trip, Fell on my Face.'  (That was before I learned how to do things such as, say, morphing superscopes and moving whirlpools).<br />
<br />
Colored Points - Another incredibly over used idea, but I can give you a bit of a tip: When blur is your only fader, use a Fadeout at it's lowest level.  Otherwise the blur won't fade everything out all of the time.<br />
<br />
Mad - Very basic, but not like anything I've ever seen, except that it sorta looks a little bit like Zen-X's 'Proper Filthy Naughty.'  But not that much.  I really like the colors<br />
<br />
Ring of Colored Fire - Didn't do that much for me, but another tip: yellow isn't a built in variable.  It looked like you were tring to randomize the color on beat, but since blue was always 1, it only went between blue and white.  And you got your other variables mixed up, too.  Try<br />
beat:<br />
cr=rand(100)/50; cg=rand(100)/50; cb=rand(100)/50;<br />
frame:<br />
red=cr; green=cg; blue=cb;<br />
<br />
Looks like you have an overall feel for how AVS works, but you need to learn how to put effects together to get a desired outcome.  Sort of like knowing your scales and modes but not knowing how to improvise ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, rattaplan, the only 'master' of AVS without his own style is David Hansen.

			<strong>THX!</strong><br />
		
		

		@ Nic01: thanks, I will change a few things. Maybe there will be a secong version of my first package<br />
@ ;-c, rattaplan: this package took 1-2 hours, before I experimented a bit.<br />
@ UnConeD: If I make the text in the intro bigger it's too big for my avs window...<br />
@ Atero: thanks, too.<br />
<br />
I will change the things you said...<br />
<br />
thx @ all!

		I'm sorry as I aready said, but it's true, a lot of the 'good presets' as the crowd will call them are just all alike:<br />
<br />
a SSC,<br />
a DM or some other effects.<br />
<br />
That's all!!<br />
<br />
It may look real in 3d and anything and they are real nice to see, but they're not much different in basic. Sure, the formula's are really different per ssc or dm. but that'll all that ever changes...<br />
<br />
That's why i like newcomers. They're not influenced by the general idea of a 'good looking' preset and have another, fresh, point of view toward AVS<br />
<br />
that inspires me<br />
<br />
And again, I don't want to offend anybody, that includes David, I just want to see beautiful presets, no more...<br />
<br />
Warm greetings,<br />
<br />
