      <p class="post-content">You said 'mostly remixes'. Maybe you should think of giving credit to the original artists. (I couldnt recognize any presets)<br />
      Some presets are pretty insane, tons of trans effects packed together to create some very sort of cheap (or n00b) visuals. And the speed is very slow.<br />
      <br />
      edit: for someone new I would give :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi my name is Tuggummi, and im the worlds biggest asshole when it comes to ripping! Let's get this straight right away, shall we?<br />
      <br />
      <font size="4"><font color="red">If you use stuff not coded by you, <u>credit the author!</u></font></font><br />
      <br />
      Is that clear enough for ya?<br />
      Come on! Do you really think we won't notice that you ripped someone elses work around here? I doubt you wrote any code yourself, and that skull picture you used isn't made by you either, that is made by Danjoe and it was used in his Amigan FX pack. Also i noticed you took some of my code too, like in the presets: "distraught_marble" &amp; "distortedreality" (btw. do you think multiplying things with 1 will do anything?)<br />
      <br />
      Happy avsing, but don't rip peoples work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea I do recognize a few of them. I have done the same thing before but I just changed the presets in &#226;&#8364;&#339;super scope&#226;&#8364;. I haven&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t been modifying any one else&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Like tug said, The first rule for using someone else's work is:<br />
      <b>CREDIT THE AUTHOR</b><br />
      but since you acknowledged that they are mixes(please mention from whom's work are they taken) and not your own , i'll be nice with you <b>BUT</b> try making original stuff OK?:)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>apologies</strong><br />
      yes i was wrong in not crediting the autors of the origanal presets and i apologize for not doing so, big ups to all i may have upset in this error. next time i will be sure to do so. im prolly going to just start off fresh and do my own next time lol. thanx everyone</p>
