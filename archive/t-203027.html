<div class="posttext">Hi, I created a library of &quot;building blocks&quot; for the AVS SuperScope. They can be used to learn how to use the SuperScope or to create complex visualizations.<br />
<br />
The libSuperScope includes functions for creating:<br />
<br />
 Horizontal and vertical lines<br />
 Square, rectangles and polygons<br />
 Circle, arc, ellipse and spire<br />
 3D shapes<br />
 More complex shapes ...<br />
<br />
All presets are configurable, the parameters are explained in a comment inside the preset:<br />
<br />
http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~ccastill/libSuperScope/beta.png<br />
<br />
Just unpack the zip file into your &quot;Program files/Winamp/Plugins/avs&quot; directory. This 29Kb package contains a brief introduction to the superscope, the libSuperScope library itself and some demos of how to use library.<br />
<br />
This is a beta version. I would like to hear your comments and suggestions before posting a 1.0 version. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is a very nice package. Mattfury, i suggest you go through this and try to take it all in, you could learn alot.<br />
<br />
ChaTo: you could make the code a bit more readable by using some spaces within brackets and so on. At the moment it looks a bit jumbled because of the long variable names. Also, you can use comments (// and /* */).<br />
<br />
Anyway, its a nice idea, and a good guide to any beginner. Unlike a tutorial, this actualy requires the person to think, not just do.<br />
<br />
The example presets are pretty ugly though :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i agree with sidd, this is worth a lot here. And Matt, I really don't believe this is a rip. At least I know none of us made this, or else we'd all know this, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th December 2004, 00:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well matt is probably just jealous, because someone showed up from nothing with some really well-coded presets...<br />
<br />
However, this pack offers a good way to learn: just look into the code and try to figure out what everything does...<br />
That's mostly more efficient (and mentally demanding) than asking one question after the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">some really nice examples, a way to learn alot on how to make scopes. but i guess matt was right this time in one preset: complex_plankton is codewise really familiar to unconed's plankton preset's SCC. not sure if its a rip, but the variables are identical :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry, just some of it looks like some remixs and stuff pak-9's done or otherwise other artists...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">about the rippage, I didn't notice it except for the plankton-like one. But even so, these aren't designed as presets, these are guides; I don't get the impression that ChaTo was even trying to be &quot;artistically original&quot;. <br />
<br />
It doesnt matter at all in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

i totally agree. and mostly people learn from unconed's scopes anyway :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi everybody. Some of the COMPLEX_* and 3D_* shapes are originally from other authors (and I didn't try to hide that e.g.: I kept the original names such as 'plankton'). I will include the credits in the 1.0 release.<br />
<br />
Anyways in those cases my intention was to provide parametrized versions of their superscope parts, so other authors can learn from them. That's the idea of this package. Thank you for your comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry, but I don't see how providing parametrized versions of other people's scopes helps people learn how to make their own. All they will do is use them, tweak the parameters, and move on.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you learnt a lot from making this package, but I'm not so sure others will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But...ChaTo...ure coding is.....&quot;creative&quot; to say the least! But still great that YOU can do those scopes!<br />
:up:</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but I don't see how providing parametrized versions of other people's scopes helps people learn how to make their own. <br />
Note that most of the pack is &quot;original&quot; --  or at least as original as a circle or a line can be :) -- If you feel umcomfortable with some of the contents of the package please let me know and I'll remove it when releasing.<br />
<br />
I think the importance of a library of SuperScope functions goes beyond learning, because someone could have artistic skills but lack the math background/skills for creating shapes with the superscope, and in that case tweaking the parameters of some basic shapes will be his/her choice. If anyone has basic, 3D or complex superscope shapes to include in the library, please let me know. Thanks.<br />
<br />
MaTTFURY<br />
(Y)ou should try writing a tutorial to go with it, not just pictures<br />
<br />
You're right, a tutorial such as PAK-9's AVS Programming Guide (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/) is necessary, but I guess some code to play with it good for those who prefer a hands-on approach. Thanks for the comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think if you have worked through paks great guide you should have learned enough to be familiar with the examples in your lib.<br />
so what about if you gave a link to paks guide with your collection instead of making an own new tutorial? to me it would be enough.</div></div><hr />
