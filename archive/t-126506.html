      <p class="post-content"><strong>I am in 9th std</strong><br />
      In India, the education system is very different.<br />
      I am 14 years old, so I am in 9th std.<br />
      <br />
      in kindergarden (did i spell it right?) you learn basic add,subtract..<br />
      in fourth standard - adavnced division, multiplication.<br />
      <br />
      5-8...area, volume, quadratic equaltions, linear equations in one unknown, etc..<br />
      <br />
      in 9th std. maths is divided into 2, algebra and geomerty.<br />
      in geomerty, there is isoscles theorem, midpoint theorem, etc,etc,etc, etc, and a lot of etc.<br />
      more advanced in 10th std.<br />
      <br />
      in 11th, i.e Junior College, you learn trig.<br />
      <br />
      I learnt a lot of trig at this age only..for AVS you know.</p>

      as a matter of fact, i should be into second semester calculus, if it weren't for the fact that i can't get answers right the first time i do 'em. really, i AM good at math. i just can't ever do a problem right the first time, and i'm too compulsive to check them :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">not where I come from...the '3' is the semester<br />
      so freshman year (or 8th grade if you're smart) is Algebra 1-2, Sophomore/Junior year is Algebra 3 / Trig (one semester of Algebra 3, one of trig)...and btw, Phaze, it is not a lot of geomtery because geometry is more dealing with properties of shapes, so AVS uses more trig and algebra...you can't just say 'draw rhombus' to make a rhombus.<br />

      <p class="post-content">uNDefineD, I'm doing my final year, so I'll tell you next year ;)<br />
      <br />
      And here, we only have a few groups of secondary level maths at year 11 and 12: Foundation (dumbass maths), General, Further (Year 12 General), Maths Methods (Yr 11 &amp; 12), and Specialist Maths. I'm doing methods and specialist :D, although methods has all been done before, the specialist is kinda fun, but only touches the basics of the more advanced maths.</p>

      </blockquote>i also learnt trig at home, using the internet. we have trig in 11th std, and I am still in 9th, i think that's what high school is. i get confused with the american education system. hardy boys were 17-18 yrs old and they went to high school, so those who go to junior college, they too are of the same age. after 12th std, you go to college and after three years, you graduate from college, i.e BSc, Bcom, BA or whatever. then you can furthur study and become MA, MSc, etc (master in sc.).<br />
      in India, we dont have so many branches of maths, just algebra and geomtry and you have to learn both. it's compulsary

      <p class="post-content">Im another Aussie, and I am in Year 11, 5th form for you foreigners,<br />
      I take Advanced ( 2 Unit ) Maths, and Advanced English, Plus Chem, Bio , Engineering Stduies and other rubbish,<br />
      What I want to know is, how long did it take you to actually learn avs? were you immediately able to jump in with your maths knowledge or did you sit back and learn like I did, cause i havent even seen any Jheriko or UnConeD making N00bish presets like I did.</p>
