<div class="posttext">Yeah, i heard music reactive ones are pretty good...<br />

<br />
Seriously, why do people post these &quot;requests&quot; of &quot;I want this and that avs and blablabla&quot; There is literally thousands of presets out there in the WinAmp's AVS Preset category, all you need to do is to<br />
GO GET THEM (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/browse.php?sortby=&amp;shownum=20&amp;ctype=P&amp;category=11)<br />
And take your pick... Or are you just being lazy to find out what's good for yourself?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">select &quot;most downloaded&quot; or &quot;highest stars&quot; (or so). That'll give you some good stuff</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm having sort of the opposite problem: finding good music to go with my AVS's-in-progress. I listen to a lot of orchestral and instrumental music, which is why they kinda 'explode' when stuff like rock and metal is played.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, new questions, i am totally lost when it comes to pre-sets, i have a general idea of srt of what they do, but if anyone has any uggestions on how i can optomize the presets to go with the music better that would be great, or if someone can suggest another thread which could explain presets to me that would alos be great</div></div><hr />

there isnt really a lot of presets coded for easy music and beat field isnt activated much... hence... thats why all 'explodes' when you tune in some 'rock and metal'. Tho' im quite covinced that not many AVSers listen to 'rock and metal' when coding presets<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually, the beat detection goes off quite a lot with orchestral. Hits, pizzies, etc. all set it off and it kinda goes crazy in some brass sections. <br />
<br />
But, I'm digressing. Are there any particular songs that'd be good for using for testing that I should look for? My parents have a huge CD collection, they'll probably have a few things that'd be good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It really doesnt matter, just nothing too quiet or beatless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">most presets react best with dance music - i personally prefer Darude. Not that I like the sound of it, but the beats are easy to pick up by a beat detector.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that a good preset should look good with all sorts of music.</div></div><hr />

try some MilkDrop?  <br />
Don't you ever say that word :(<br />
<br />
The best music for avs is techno/trance(i find the best)/dance/rave etc - anything made by a dj really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th November 2004, 23:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that's why many of my presets don't react that good to music: I don't really like techno, dance and all... I prefer good Rock-stuff. But unfortunately most of songs of that genre provide &quot;indistinct&quot; visualizing data. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">MaTTFURY</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th November 2004, 04:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hey whats wrong with milk-drop? (avs is still cool for dance-clubs i think its what made for?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th November 2004, 09:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">milkdrop is superiorly unsuperior, it's not half as customizable as avs, there is only a very limited range of effects and the movement is crap. The only upside is its speed. Avs has the superscope, it's like the all-powerful awesomeness thing. .  . The colours in mildrop are either too dull or too bright, i haven't yet seen a preset with good colours. It plain old sucks.<br />
Anything you can make in milkdrop avs can make better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th November 2004, 15:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's right. Also most milkdrop presets somehow look the same.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well ok ill believe you... i was just mucking around with milkdrop b4...</div></div><hr />
