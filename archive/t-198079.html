      Seriously, why do people post these "requests" of "I want this and that avs and blablabla" There is literally <b>thousands</b> of presets out there in the WinAmp's AVS Preset category, all you need to do is to<br />

      And take your pick... Or are you just being lazy to find out what's good for yourself?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the info, new questions, i am totally lost when it comes to pre-sets, i have a general idea of srt of what they do, but if anyone has any uggestions on how i can optomize the presets to go with the music better that would be great, or if someone can suggest another thread which could explain presets to me that would alos be great</p>

      </blockquote>there isnt really a lot of presets coded for easy music and beat field isnt activated much... hence... thats why all 'explodes' when you tune in some 'rock and metal'. Tho' im quite covinced that not many AVSers listen to 'rock and metal' when coding presets<br />

      <p class="post-content">Actually, the beat detection goes off quite a lot with orchestral. Hits, pizzies, etc. all set it off and it kinda goes crazy in some brass sections.<br />
      <br />
      But, I'm digressing. Are there any particular songs that'd be good for using for testing that I should look for? My parents have a huge CD collection, they'll probably have a few things that'd be good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">most presets react best with dance music - i personally prefer Darude. Not that I like the sound of it, but the beats are easy to pick up by a beat detector.<br />
      <br />
      Keep in mind though that a good preset should look good with all sorts of music.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that's why many of my presets don't react that good to music: I don't really like techno, dance and all... I prefer good Rock-stuff. But unfortunately most of songs of that genre provide "indistinct" visualizing data. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">milkdrop is superiorly unsuperior, it's not half as customizable as avs, there is only a very limited range of effects and the movement is crap. The only upside is its speed. Avs has the superscope, it's like the all-powerful awesomeness thing. . . The colours in mildrop are either too dull or too bright, i haven't yet seen a preset with good colours. It plain old sucks.<br />
      Anything you can make in milkdrop avs can make better.</p>
