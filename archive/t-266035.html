			<strong>How do I...</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm trying to make a vis that's themed off of the Halo 3 Trailer (<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/3/5b3d8532-65bc-4bf6-b5ea-6ba0f2084d74/h3_e32006_announce_large.wmv" target="_blank">Link</a>) from the part at the end with the blue text kind of bubbling and exploding.  I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  How do I make 2-d squares &quot;explode&quot; off the screen?  How can I make the main image &quot;bubble&quot; really big?  Any help is appreciated.

		Ya, I've tried the basics (that's all I know, really) but all I can get them to do is spin.  And I'm not sure how to get the image to &quot;bulge&quot; out.  Any advice?

		Hmm it seems interesting. but its not my area. i mostly do simple themes. but with halo comes raytracing and i havent even scratched the surface of that area yet. i can't even code buffers. wahh!!

		(*sigh*)  And I thought that if I learned Calculus, this would be easy.  Now where are those dang C++ books at...<br />
<br />
I've made some progress, though.  It'll probably be done in the next 5-10 years.

			<strong>Hmm</strong><br />
		
		

		Knowing a programming knowledge will make learning avs easier but learning avs's advanced topics takes time and practice.<br />
<br />
let me guess your current skill lvl revolves around making sscs rotate using simple vector math right.<br />
<br />
Lesson:<br />
when you want to rotate a ssc in the avs world you have use vectors.<br />
this is something i learned from Pak-9's avs programming guide.<br />
<br />
init: n=2;<br />
frame: rot=rot+0.05;<br />
beat:<br />
Point:<br />
x1=i*2-1;// this will create a line<br />
y1=0;<br />
x1=x1;<br />
y1=y1;<br />
// this is the rotation code<br />
x=x1*sin(rot)+y1*cos(rot);<br />
y=x1*cos(rot)-y1*sin(rot);<br />
/* this is the basic vector equation i learned from pak-9's avs programming guide */<br />
<br />
now the next part.<br />
rotating a solid square. again this is simple.<br />
<br />
init: n=100; s=1;<br />
frame: rot=rot+0.05;<br />
beat:<br />
Point:<br />
s=-s; // this creates a alternating number<br />
x1=i*2-1;// this will create a line<br />
y1=s;<br />
x1=x1*.5;<br />
y1=y1*.5;<br />
// this is the rotation code<br />
x=x1*sin(rot)+y1*cos(rot);<br />
y=x1*cos(rot)-y1*sin(rot);<br />
<br />
end of lesson<br />
<br />
as you can just rotating something is simple.<br />
now look for pak-9's avs programming guide and read it and learn from it.<br />
post what you learn from it.<br />
<br />
next will be 3d.<br />
heh i warn you i learned everything i know from pak-9's guide so i've managed to pick up some new tricks in the process. idea. look at the post in the avs presets section called 3d model practice and you will see what i mean.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you grasp avs better.<br />
oh and keep those evil c++ book out of here. i have enough of a head ache as it is.
