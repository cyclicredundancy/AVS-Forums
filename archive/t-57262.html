<div class="posttext">This is a tutorial for AVS that I fixed up just for the guys that want's to start using AVS, it also goes over syntax in superscopes and movements.<br />
You might find this useful if you want to start working with AVS.<br />
Send me a PM anytime if you need more help(I'd love to see this in some version of AVS, anyone? :p)<br />

<div class="posttext">can somebody explain to me what is a tutorial, hehe :) Just kidding, had to learn all by myself took me a half year to discover sites as the late deskmod, but then I knew how to use basic effects as SSC's and movements. (there was not much more than that in those days :)) Now we're well over a year further and I learned a lot from people on the net, so that's why it's great to have an tutorial online to give people more inspiration and insight in AVS. My point of view there can't be enough AVS-tutorials outhere, they'll deliver more crazy and beautiful AVS :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">To use X and Y you have to select &quot;rect cords&quot; also known as &quot;rectangular coordinates&quot;.<br />
<br />
Man You know it is lie :) or the info about that vars in MOVEMENTS are incomplete..<br />
<br />
<br />
Everibody can use the X and Y vars without selecting &quot;rectangular coordinates&quot;<br />
<br />
try to use the example they give YOU now do<br />
d=d*0.9 + x; try to use &quot;* + - and /&quot; and see what  append :D <br />
than do the same with Y</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ssup everyone<br />
<br />
I've looked at the tutorial and I must say that it can be better:). I've paved my own way through the AVS development and I know how those beginners feel. Napolean, your idea about the html page sounds good. A good web site about that stuff should help people. Lets just say that I'm willing to help as I have experience in web site creation. Check out Roma's Picture Gallery (http://www.geocities.com/sadarqii) or Roma's AVS Gallery (http://www.geocities.com/romaavs) to see what I mean:).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just wanted to say that what linus wrote in his tutorial about x and y was correct. But you misunderstood what he was trying to say you MUST check rectangular coordinates in your movements and dyn. movements, when you want to use a movement as x=x+0.1 or y=y+0.1, try it with out the option checked nothing happens since only d and r can be modified then. the example Napoleon gave, d=d*0.9 + x, worked without rect. coor. because you weren't modifying x or y, but d. that was all I would like to say about this.</div></div><hr />
