      <p class="post-content">Psychotic Mental Patient - Needs alpha blending and something else besides the DM. Also the colors form a hard edge - try to get rid of this.<br />
      Softening - Alright effect with the DM, but it turns completely white sometimes because of the bump. The SSC shouldn't use the color cycler - use the red/green/blue variables to make it responsive.<br />
      Supersonic - Don't really like the colors. This preset isn't very responsive and needs some more work.<br />
      Hellfire - Needs some changes IMHO. I like it more with the first movement being changed to a DM (for ex. - frame: gd=.9*gd+.1*dd;beat: dd=rand(100)/100;pixel: d=d*gd;) and without the unique tone.<br />
      Nightmare - O.K. but I've seen similar. Change the oscilliscope star to a SS.<br />
      No escape - Not bad, I kinda like the effect. The last DM should be changed to a more reactive 3D DM.<br />
      Water movement - I like the background. Nice tile effect. The SS is definitely different - kinda looks cool when you raise in to about 2000 or so.<br />
      Drained - get rid of the stretched edges - Also the drain effect isn't very obvious.<br />
      Tiled - Similar to others in the pack. Use a 3D DM.<br />
      Swirly - Seen a similar effect before. Change the moving particles to SSCs - this will improve it some, but this is an often used effect.<br />
      <br />
      Overall I give the pack a 3. Work on 3D math and make the colors more eye-friendly.</p>

      been avsing for a couple months and 3d math really isnt my speciality (major understatement) but i got that lot done so i could probably do it with a little time. See more feedback first tho.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not bad overall. Some need work, some are fine the way they are. Personal fave was water movement. Don't think I've seen anything quite like it. :)<br />
      <br />
      I found some of them to run a bit too slow on my athalon 800. :(<br />
      <br />
      I wouldn't use anything as jumpy as getosc in a calculation that's done each frame, I find it makes the preset too chaotic and dtracts from the whole preset.<br />
      <br />
      A quick and easy way to get rid of the edges for drain would be 4 black superscopes, one for each side.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another way is to tile it so that the edges match (several ways to do this). Water movement is definitely original. Also, to speed up some of them you can take out things like blurs. Here's some recomendations.<br />
      In psychotic mental patient the brightness, the simple, and the blur are hardly noticable; use alpha blending to hide the back instead of the simples.<br />
      In softening I would recommend taking out the bump and changing the effect list to subtractive2/replace. It looks somewhat interesting with a fast brightness in there too.<br />
      In supersonic take out at least one of the blurs and I like it w/o the water.<br />
      In hellfire change the brightness to a fast brightness and the last effectlist doesn't seem to do anything.<br />
      In no escape take out some bumps and blends in the effectlist.<br />
      In Water Movement take out the blur and blitter feedback and try to find a different dynamic movement that doesn't have a vertical line that doesn't change (this is somewhat obvious in the preset).<br />
      In drained take out a blur.<br />
      In tiled take out a couple bumps and blurs and taking out the first mirror is optional. This added a total of 10FPS on my computer.<br />
      In swirly taking out the bump adds a lot of FPS but changes the effect some. Doesn't really matter because swirly is already fast.</p>

      <p class="post-content">alpha is a variable used to define the transparency of the pixels changed by the DM. Alpha ranges from 0 (no trans.) to 1 (full trans. where only the image defined in the source box is displayed). To see the effects of it in 04.avs add the line "alpha=(x+1)/2;" to the end of the pixel editbox and check the blend box.<br />
      <br />
      I might have gotten the alpha values mixed up. Let me know if I did.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ive redone a lot of things, thanks for the help guys, ive got 5 presets that i consider packworthy. I dont want to release one of those crappy packs full of presets all seen before and too bright and chaotic moving particles.... etc etc you get the idea. I want to release a good pack i can be proud of.<br />
      <br />
      First off, "Phsycoticmentalpatient", Used a different movement to get rid of that line that kept moving around and used alpha blending and a superscope to redo the back bit. Used mirrors at points though (last resort).<br />
      "Softening", changed the superscope so it dosent use the colour cycler, no longer fades to white at points.<br />
      "No Escape", its basically the same, i tried making a 3d DM for it but it ruined the effect so i left it the way it was, probably made some minor changes, cant remember.<br />
      "Water movement", made this much more interesting with a DM.<br />
      "Tiled", Changed the Dmso its less like No Escape, changed the colours around and some of the cheap effects, no major changes but still looks much better.<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions, tips, constructive critisism, whatever, the usual crap very welcome.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Psychotic Mental Patient - Much better but still has a couple of problems. The alpha blending runs into the sides some. This can be fixed by changing it to alpha=x+3. Also using a buffer blend with a solid color could look a little better but isn't necessary.<br />
      Softening - Try making the colors beat responsive.<br />
      No escape - take out the bumps and blends for additional FPS.<br />
      Water movement - This is definitely original<br />
      Tiled - I like it! Take out the colorfade the first mirror and the blur. And in the second DM you use x and y but rectangular coordinates isn't checked.<br />
      Big improvement on all presets. Make some more before you release a pack though. 5 isn't enough.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It now has UES(Ugly Edge Syndrome). Use a higher grid size to fix this. Or you can find another way to cut off the rest of the screen (i.e black lines at x=-1, x=1, y=-1, and y=1). Also have it change rotational velocities smoothly (vx=.9*vx+.1*tvx, etc.).</p>

      the preset in your eyes may seem dull or now how you want it but never the less as long as the maker likes it..thats all that matters<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ugly Edges are considered the edges in DM's that seem out of place and are side effects of some 3D DM's. In his preset if you look at the edges of the rectangle you will notice them curving and folding. If this is the effect that he is going for, then he is free to use it, but it is normally not desired. I'm not personally dissing his preset, I'm just using what is the common name given to this side effect. In order to fix it, the grid size can be increased or use some sort of tiling, etc.<br />
      Regarding your remix- not much of a remix than a new preset, I can't even tell visually that it is a remix. I like the effect though. The brightness needs to be turned down some and it needs to be sped up(only 11FPS at 320x200 windowed).</p>
