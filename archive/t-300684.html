      <p class="post-content"><strong>I need some help.</strong><br />
      <b>Here's the trick;</b><br />
      <br />
      I've just recently started to grasp some kind of understanding of different codes, especially concerning the superscope.<br />
      Now I need some sort of movement to this preset I'll attach.<br />
      <br />
      The thing is that I want the two superscopes that are horizontal to be used as a render to a "cloudy sky" and a "rocky ground". Now I just need some sort of movement, probably dynamic to have it speed up at beats and maybe change direction slightly.<br />
      <br />
      I can clearly see the code for the change of direction before me, but I have ablosutely no id&#195;&#402;&#194;&#169;a of how to make it function as a ground. Every try I've made has just been f***ed up and also makes the trace fade which is not what I want.<br />
      <br />
      So my question to you is:<br />
      Got any good id&#195;&#402;&#194;&#169;as?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello ShenLung,<br />
      <br />
      here, i tried it... added 2 effect lists with seperate render outputs, 1 for the ground and 1 for the sky.<br />
      <br />
      cheers,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Here just another one... think this looks more plastic than the previous one...<br />
      <br />
      btw. there is no dynamic movement needed here... the movement u want is static:<br />
      <br />
      the sky superscope should be pulled upside, drawing the sky on its path... and the other way round for the ground. Dynamic movement would come into play, if u want to start changing the movement over time... for example if u want to modify the speed and direction of the movement over time, on beats, etc.<br />
      <br />
      An idea on the vertical lightning movement: it could be nice to not let the lightning jump from position to posiotion, but move slowly from one spot to the other on every beat.<br />
      <br />
      good luck,<br />
