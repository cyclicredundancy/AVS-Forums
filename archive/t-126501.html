<div class="posttext">Anybody interested in making a new visualization studio?  I'm not good enough at programming yet to do this, but with other's help something could be made.  I'm doing this to keep Atero from going crazy at the n00bs who would probably not start a new thread for this when asked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would be keen. Im going to learn opengl soon. I think thats the way to go by the way. I think a platform like vjo would be good. But at the end of the day - theres heaps of software out there. Im not sure if its worth the effort!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If anyone wants to make a new AVS editor (not AVS Studio, the S stands for studio :igor: ) I have a basic beginning of a document detailing the binary file structure of .avs files. PM me to get it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">anubis, I would be very glad to help,<br />
i know c, i am learning visual basic and visual c++.<br />
what about namic it VVS (visual visualisation studio).<br />
<br />
I alreay have tons of ideas in my mind. thought some of them would come in AVS3 :<br />
like you can paint ssc's, how about that.<br />
you will draw basic lines on the screen and the programme will give you code for it.<br />
then you can move it as you like it. i know this os difficult, but i dont think, it is immposiible.<br />
<br />
another idea: instead of making another vis. programme, why not make a programme which would read an AVS file, then open a song and output the visualisation as well as the song to an AVI file?<br />
i know there are ape's available to dump the output to an .avi,<br />
but you cant synchronize the sound with it properly</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know some C++ but thats all.Opengl,delphi,visual basic = 0 for me :) I`d understand them easy only that a very important factor appears : lazyness ! (or is it laziness?) I didnt drink...Too much!Party up yehe ! Home alone no damn school</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if i understand something, then its Turbo Pascal (7.0, fp), and that wont go for programming &quot;new visualization studio&quot;</div></div><hr />

Doesn't look like this program will ever get started.  It requires some decent coding skills, and I don't think we have enough between the bunch of us.  After a couple years of college I will probably make one, and yes it will have SSC's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">anubis: by that time, i think nullsoft will launch avs3. then your programme will be of no use!</div></div><hr />

Get Delphi! It's based on Pascal and easy to understnd. Although it is not as powerfull as C++, it's ten times better than VB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">why bother making a new one?<br />
AVS needs to be updated, but one we make won't be as good as the current AVS.</div></div><hr />

Its a brain wave generated computer interface. There is a fairly basic (from what I can gather) visualiser.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would be totally up for this :)  I can program some OpenGL and SDL, but unfortunatly, I code mostly in Linux....  so if anyone is up for a cross platform type dealie, then I'm in :D  other than that, to help with the windows side of things, I would hafta buy that damn visual c++ (insert trendy version here) :(</div></div><hr />
