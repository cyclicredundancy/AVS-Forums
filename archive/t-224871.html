		Man this pack <b>blows</b>.<br />
<br />
It blows because it has been touched by gay-bacteria.<br />
It blows because when you gave the remixables i thought that was only 50% of your pack.<br />
It blows because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=224084" target="_blank">someone</a>  did a 10 times better pack than this with 90% less technical prowness.<br />
<br />
And you still dare to call yourself a AVSer? Go to the the corner and be <b><u>ashamed</u></b> of yourself!

		That intro just cracked me up! It's even a better surprise than what &quot;Extrude&quot; from your &quot;Avs 4 SE&quot; pack had. If nothing else, you get points for making me laugh!<br />
<br />
Nebulous makes me think of that Futurama episode where Bender meets God.<br />
<br />
Ephemeral might be cooler with a little colour added... just enough so that the viewer can't be entirely sure whether he's imagining the colour or not. (In fact, I'm tempted to try remixing that one just a little bit.)<br />
<br />
Beanies is just plain cute! I almost want to adopt one, but I'm certain my cat would eat it.<br />
<br />
Shooting Star was just a surprise!<br />
<br />
AVS Blox... Pure insanity! &quot;A million points for style!&quot; Cruelly ironic, though, that this shows up just days before I (hopefully) finish tweaking the AI in a Tic-Tac-Toe game I'm developing for AVS... Now that's not going to seem as special, thanks a lot! :cry:<br />
<br />
Bombs Away. No kiddin'.<br />
<br />
What is up with that Pandora remix? Frankly, I don't think it belongs in this pack. It's a cube. Even I've done cubes! The original Pandora and some of the remixes in the previous pack were much, much better.<br />
<br />
Darkmatter, Disturbed Remix... That one's just begging for someone to scream, &quot;OMG, the RGB, it BURRRRNS!&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Overall... :up: :up:

Wow, I cant believe somebody actually made that connection &lt;wavy flashback&gt; I was watching that futurama episode and I though &quot;man, how cool would it be if those blobs were music response and the clouds were all 3D and badass and cooool&quot;. So I set about making it, but I never expected anyone to recognise the link (creativity is all about hiding your sources right? ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comment :)

		next time, think before you're posting dumb posts.<br />
<br />
1) You don't even know what you're saying, and <i>still</i> you're posting<br />
2) You're doubleposting, which is postpumping and against the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/rules.php" target="_blank"><font color="red">rules</font></a><br />
3) you're just new here and already telling us what to do?!<br />
you must have some groundbreaking presets if you dare to speak up like this. Can't wait to see your first pack. :rolleyes:<br />

		hey qforce, wir könnten natürlich auch anfangen auf deutsch über diese malayischen nasenbären abzulästern, aber auf das niveau lassen wir uns besser gar nicht erst herunter, oder? ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, dear malaysian people. I don`t know if you realized it already, but this is an english-speaking forum.<br />
One last time: If you still want to talk in malaysian here, then please use the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=19" target="_blank">international connection subforum</a>. Otherwise we'll have to consider your malaysian posts as senseless postpumping which is against the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/rules.php" target="_blank"><font color="red">rules</font></a> as WotL already said.<br />
I think, you both have been warned often enough now.

		Not only stop the malaysian, also the insulting.<br />
You don't even know us.<br />
<br />
In here, you gain respect by showing the quality of your presets (climbing on the ladder) and not by kicking others down that ladder by insulting them. Especially when you're a n00b. Again, it's about the quality of the presets, not about acting like an AOL kid.<br />
<br />
And I repeat, if you want to have a conversation between the two of you alone, discuss it over <a href="http://messenger.msn.com" target="_blank">IM</a> or by PM's here.

		Meh, I hate having to translate everything on babelfish. There's no finnish, but any that Tug blurts out is mostly nonsense anyway. Why can't we all just speak American? :p

		you must've meant: why can't we all just speak English! :p<br />
<br />
But i agree, mostly it's quite annoying when people start to talk in their foreign native language all the time. Especially when you get the impression that they're making witty jokes about you, that you cannot understand!

<br />
and d_DaY_aT: Als je echt in Nederland woonde, dan zou je het niet over <i>da</i> dutch hebben. Jammer joh. Zo wel, kap dan met dat geouwehoer. Dit leidt nergens naar.

		So much unfriendliness. Hehe. Maybe I'm too nice and idealistic posting my avs presets on here and being all nice about it and not insulting the masters. Hehe. They're more likely to give me feedback good or bad if I don't act all arrogant like and attack them from the bottom of the ladder. That looked like pretty illiterate malaysian by the way. I guess it's all high school slang. Seems like english isn't the only language going to hell.
