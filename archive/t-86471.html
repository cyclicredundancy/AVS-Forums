      <p class="post-content">Hey man, chill. :cool:<br />
      <br />
      I takes time to review things. When I do an indepth review, depending on the size of the pack, it can take an hour. Yours is a large pack, and, sometime I just don't feel like spending an hour watching AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Here are some general comments.<br />
      <br />
      - Some stuff is neat, but a lot of it is confused. There's lots of stuff going on, but nothing really has the focus.<br />
      - There are some unnecessary things. There's one where there's a movement with "-1.0" in it, which does nothing.<br />
      - Check your math. In circles I believe it was called, you have a movement with "e=someequatuionhere; r=e/e;". The same thing could be acomplished with "r=0;".<br />
      - I liked swirl. I recall having made something similar called "twisty thingee". It might still be somewhere on my HD. :)<br />
      - In "moving lines" you use a DM that pretty nice, but in other posts you say you don't understand DMs. If you do use another person's DM give them credit in a comment; something like "DM by ...".<br />
      - Don't zip the entire path, you only need the dir with the presets. :p<br />
      - You do have some nifty superscopes.<br />
      <br />
      That's it for general comments.<br />
      <br />
      BTW. Who says you need a DM to make a cool preset. Don't know who made it, but ShoutingMime posted it a while ago.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Please, zip the files - not the whole directory...<br />
      <br />
      They're kinda boring... No beat detection... Stuck at one view... Not exactly eye candies...<br />
      <br />
      2.5/5 for rating... Still got some work to go, eh?<br />
      <br />
      Deep in Galaxy 1 and 2 are almost the same... I don't think you can regard the 2nd one as a sequel...<br />
      <br />
      A lot of work ahead of you : You're going along with SSCs pretty nicely - Now, if only you can make'em more dynamic - not fixed in a place...<br />
      <br />
      Learn DM, buddy...<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and I think your taste o' AVS is quite different from mine... So This review have a possibility of being not worthy...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd have to agree with Nic01 on most of his points. (though I'd like to think I wouldn't be so blunt (no offence Nic01))<br />
      <br />
      Beat responsiveness is a big thing for me. It's a big way of showing that the visuals are infact connected to the music. It doesn't necessarily have to be a big change, but change adds variety to the preset and makes it more watchable. Take a look at the attached preset (anyshape). The superscope may be nice (heck, I'm proud of it), but if it didn't rotate and change rotation on the beat it wouldn't even get a second glace. People would say "Oh, cool, a star. What other presets do I have?". I'd do it.<br />
      <br />
      DMs are a good way to make your preset more interesting. They don't have to be complex, just so long as they produce a good movement. (see 01 - missle swarm for example).<br />
      <br />
      Like I said in another thred, check the sticky FAQ thred if you want to learn more. Take apart other people's DMs and Superscopes. See what makes them do what they do. (I wouldn't suggest trying to take apart any of Unconed's though. It will lead to insaity.) :p</p>

      I really like your preset Green_land. I love the S Scopes in that preset. I can't wait to see your next preset-I'm sure it will be much improved.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, good start on the DMs. I liked the one in "there goes the world" best. In swing, I'm don't think you want to be messing with x and y if you're not gonna use rectangular coordinates.<br />
      <br />
      P.S.<br />
      That zip was fine, It didn't have the sub dirs.:up:</p>
