      <p class="post-content">tut tut..<br />
      its not very clear...<br />
      after all, it doesnt say "HOW TO MAKE AN UBER SUPER SCOPE IN TEN EASY STEPS" in big-fuck-off letters, does it?<br />
      no, it just sais FAQ, in tiny pissant letters.<br />
      I think we can expect that a few n00bs will wander aimlessly in the wrong dirrection before they find the gold. So there is no need to shout and flame. Just point him off on his way politely.<br />
