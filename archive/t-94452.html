<div class="posttext">I've just finished a modest little package of 8 AVS presets. One of them (Transitions Intro) is inspired by work done by Jaheckelsafar for his Rucksack AVS pack...and yes, I did give him credit, both in the AVS preset itself and in a comment in the AVS code.<br />
<br />
The AVS presets are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Transitions Intro (File: Clashman - 01 - Transitions Intro.avs)<br />
<br />
2) Back in Black (and Blue and Green!) (File: Clashman - 02 - Back in Black (and Blue and Green!).avs)<br />
<br />
3) Clash (File: Clashman - 03 - Clash.avs)<br />
<br />
4) Clash Interference Remix (File: Clashman - 05 - Clash Interference RMX.avs)<br />
<br />
5) Blittered Blues (File: Clashman - 06 - Blittered Blues.avs)<br />
<br />
6) Hyperion (File: Clashman - 08 - Hyperion.avs)<br />
<br />
7) Shadeout (File: Clashman - 09 - Shadeout.avs)<br />
<br />
8) Spanish Bomb (I worked on this one while listening to &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; by The Clash, it looked good, so I named it Spanish Bomb) (File: Clashman - 10 - Spanish Bomb.avs)<br />
<br />
Also in the ZIP file is a copy of PKZip (PKZIP.EXE), the compression utility I used to create the ZIP file that the presets are in.<br />
<br />
Feel free to comment on the quality (or lack thereof! :p ) of the presets, and keep in mind that I basically bumbled around to see what I could create and like.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, hi.<br />

&lt;ego stroking&gt;<br />
Glad to see the someone appreciates a master at work.<br />

Good start at the whole AVS thing. Bumbling is the best way to go. Now that you kind of know how things work, it's time to take it and run. Your prests had the clutter that I find typically inhabits newbie presets, which is understandaible 'cause you are a newbie judging from the last sentance in your post. :) It's time to try and make presets with some kind of form. Keep woking and learning. Ask questions (but not things like how do you do supersacopes). It's the only way to get better. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am a relative newbie...I've been bumbling around for a while, and I'm doing relatively well so far. DCCed a few to a friend of mine in [GSF], using mIRC, and he likes 'em.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I'd best get back to work. So many ideas, so little time...ah, the possibilities!<br />
