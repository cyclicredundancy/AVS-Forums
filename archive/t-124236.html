		Well, here are my current decent-ish presets. Some are from a while back, and are not so good, others are new and much better.<br />
Comments on all and any welcome, but bear in mind the comments included.<br />
Oh, some advice with colours: of those that do colours within the ssc, most are cmpltly random. Help here mebbe?

		Ok first off what the hell is wrong with that attatchment, i had to change it from document then rename it to a zip after i downloaded it before it would work.<br />
<br />
Right the presets, these all just look like the newpicks you get when you download winamp. You need to be a little more creative before you release anything. Dont get me wrong these are some pretty good noob presets and the DMs arent bad but theyve all been done way too many times.<br />
<br />
Also you need to optimise those scopes badly, in around the scope doesent need <b>any</b> of the top 3 boxes except &quot;n=800&quot;, like i said they're not bad but you need some original ideas. Dont stop trying and sort out you damned posting and attatching skills ;):p.

		Yup, Raz is correct, all of them use &quot;simpel&quot; ssc-s and n=800 is bit too much for them.<br />
In some strange reasons I liked the &quot;wobby_sine&quot; preset and thats the reason for making the remix. :p<br />
<br />
U can hardly see thet this is 3d, it needs more work, feel free to do anything with it.

Sorry for going off topic. :confused:<br />
<br />
&lt;Edit&gt;<br />
After posting this I found the &quot;bug&quot;: This all can do in 16 spetps, colculating the last (17-th) point is &quot;pointless&quot;<br />

		That is nice jack.  Add some 3-D translations(make it move around).  Isn't the cube a great 3-D starter?

		Yup, great it is and it seems to be my best preset so far. :)<br />
The movement thing is done, but if i try to rotat hole thing around x axis then all will be ****** up. Where is the bug?<br />
Maybe somebody would give me some hints to make it move in some other way than current one (ahhh, again lack of english).

		Very nice.  Now it could use something else to complement the cube.  Good base for a preset(I may be releasing one soon if I can figure some crap out).

		Nice presets fish-face( this sounds like a mobster`s name :) ).Colorful but they look kinda default like raz said...Try making your own stuff without any borrowed code,you will be surprised by results ! Anyway i took the liberty to make a remix of rippled_rings which is the best preset in this minipack.

Nope, sorry, no finnish. Btw, in summer i worked in bowrange (this medieval stuff), there were lots of Finns and other foreign people as a customers but still i cant speak not a zip of finnish... <br />
<br />
But still I want to know why i cant rotate the cube around the X axis and could anybody hint me with some kind of other ways to make movements (ofcourse other ways than my way)...<br />
<br />
There is update for the cube....

		Thanks Phaze!<br />
I shall try some completely original ones, but I think I'll keep me ringy t'ing. Oh, when using getosc, and the other &quot;get&quot; function (I think there is one...) what data does it actually read? (I know where from)

		Looks like you are rotating around the x axis Jack.<br />
<br />
x2=x1*srz+y1*crz; y2=x1*crz-y1*srz;<br />
x3=x2*sry+z1*cry; z2=x2*cry-z1*sry;<br />
y3=y2*srx+z2*crx; z3=y2*crx-z2*srx;<br />

You have all 3 axes there.
