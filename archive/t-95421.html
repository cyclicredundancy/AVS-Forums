      <p class="post-content">ssj2, some of these are pretty damn nice!!! Here's my review:<br />
      <br />
      <b>crakball:</b> Awesome colour effects, and a nice message as well. :) Could be slightly more dynamic though. 3.5/5<br />
      <b>clasik_supernova:</b> Mixed feelings about this. It's a cool effect, but the alpha on the onbeat interferences was too low for my taste. 3/5<br />
      <b>cyberspace:</b> Wow, fast! Somewhat on the basic side of the spectrum, but still cool. 2.5/5<br />
      <b>phase_distortion:</b> As much as this hurt my eyes, it rocks! Great example of "less is more". 3/5<br />
      <b>the_END:</b> This is a bit like crakball, especially with the lack of "dynamicality". When I turned off the source map I got a fantastic glow effect, so you may want to consider using that sometime. 2.5/5<br />
      <b>chalk:</b> I already reviewed this, and sorry, but my opinion hasn't changed. 1.5/5<br />
      <b>danceing flames:</b> Hmm, this is pretty bland. Okay though. 2/5<br />
      <b>DISCHORD:</b> Nice use of the fireworks there. Still on the simple side of things. 2.5/5<br />
      <b>downthedrain:</b> This is one of the better simple presets. The dot grid was used pretty well. 2.5/5<br />
      <b>MEGA_Particalstorm:</b> You really love that movement, don't you? :p The second SSC looked better second to the blitter. 3/5<br />
      <b>risingsun:</b> I think you can do a little better than this man. 2/5<br />
      <b>subdigital:</b> Even though it's similar to cyberspace, it's still quite pretty. 2.5/5<br />
      <b>subspace:</b> MUCH too similar to subdigital. New colours aren't a very decent change. 1.5/5<br />
      <b>supernova-death of a star:</b> Wow, this is a nice one! Perhaps more dynamics would be in order. 3/5<br />
      <b>Sobe_The_Worm:</b> It's, erm, interesting. It looked better with the ring on "spectrum". 2.5/5<br />
      <b>Sobe's Phat Ass Beat:</b> Holy hell, this is the best thing I've ever reviewed! Those codes look a bit familiar though... 4/5<br />
      <br />
      <b>The verdict:</b> It's pretty good for a first pack. You had some very good effects in there, albeit somewhat basic. Work on your coding a bit, and you'll be well on the way to a great AVS career. Your friend has some damn nice stuff too. My pick of the litter is Sobe's Phat Ass Beat, although I'm not sure he coded that himself. :weird:<br />
      <br />
      <b>Aesthetics:</b> :) :) :) :( :(<br />
      <b>Originality:</b> :) :) :( :( :(<br />
      <b>Overall:</b> :) :) :) :( :(</p>
