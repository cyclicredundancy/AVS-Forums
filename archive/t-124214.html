		Any ways, I was wondering if you could use a small 2d graph to demonstrate the way a superscope moves, or a dyn. movement, movement react?  Not sure if it's exactly the same idea, but paint shop pro,  cool edit pro, fruityloops all use a graph with adjustable points to modify data.  still keep the text boxes for our more advanced preset scripters.  is this possible??  i know avs 3 will be awesome.  I just think if you do this there will be MANY 4-5 star avs packs.  expand on some of your other features some, such as using avi's in winamp. WE NEED MORE OPTIONS... one goal for avs 3 should be the ability to make a music video out of AVS.  Also, with that in mind, maybe have a way to tag presets to play at a specified time during a song.  also, as unconed said, a way to control an avi using exact fps.  Hmm... how about this, being able to start an avi at a certain point..  just need to expand all together.  If i think of some more ideas, i'll put them back on this thread.  <br />
<br />
OH OH one more..  Will AVS 3 have true 3d?????!!!! :):)<br />
<br />
I've been using winamp since 1.6, I would flip if you could make winamp a movie studio too...  the feature in question is an advanced visualization studio, correct?  One last thing and I'll stop bothering everyone how many ppl world wide use winamp?  :igor:

		1: READ THE GODDAMNED FAQ.<br />
2: SEARCH THE FORUMS.<br />
AVS 2.5 can do real 3D already.  ALL of your suggestions have been mentioned already<br />
OH OH one more...don't type like an obsessive compulsive.  Being hyper doesn't get you anywhere.

		Don't think we'll be making music video's with it any time soon either.<br />
<br />
BTW, this should've been in the main AVS forum.
