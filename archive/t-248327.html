      <p class="post-content"><strong>need help on my great avs</strong><br />
      I just made this great (2d) avs. Its so nice as one of my first avs but there's 3 big problems about it.<br />
      <br />
      first, it is very slow, and its the worst avs in pixel doubling mode, so dont even try it in full screen.<br />
      <br />
      second, there is this very annoying line appearing for no reason in the middle left side of the screen. Its caused by the grid size in the last dynamove. I would be very very happy if someone would solve this little (im sure its a little problem for pros) problem. Either tell me how to or send a corrected version.<br />
      <br />
      finally, the avs only look very nice with my own songs, not because they're special songs, its because of the file type.<br />
      This can be explained with a little story:<br />
      There was a time when i beggan this avs, it was about 1 year ago, and at this time, i didn't have internet yet, so i did not have any good songs. The great solution I found is (you can laugh) to record songs from the... radio. And you know, the radio and hid annoying little sound. It just hapens that this annoying sound is what makes my avs look great, caus its a constant noise and when there's nothing in the song, it makes white and its ugly. So put your heaviest song and hope its still nice. Maybe ull find it great with white always, its ur opinion.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, give me your comments, it will be appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      oh sorry I should have put this thread in avs presets,I just didn't think of it.</p>

</pre>Your problem was in the pixel area and to be more exact: R*T. I really don't know how to explain it but I just know that if you use it with x, y or d variable you will get that line.<br />
      <br />
      In the zip file there is a version where I just fixed the DM and in the other I deleted some stuff.You can change it however you like for the colours but don't use so much useless things, just remember that if you want your preset to change the colour on beat the best way to do it is: "channel shift".

      <p class="post-content">Also, if you want to see more of my work, and soem of my codings, caus flower explosion was really low on coding, here's a little "pack" of some drawing style presets.Most of them represents 2d games caus I like making games.I did an interactive version of pong, but winamp just crashed when i was finished and :( i did forgot to save... and i was too lazy to do it all again. Remember that those presets weren't created to look great for the eyes, and they do not.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks fastin, i know my codes and how i use the effects look noob caus well im a noob. Maybe I'll work on that but<br />
      doing presets is not like my "passion". I do that because i like coding and programming and i dont have any other great programs to create codings and great stuff. And hum I dont see any zip file you posted.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey fastin, the changes you did to the codes just doesn't work caus you can't delete the "r" variable, thats what makes the "kaleodosquope"(dam how do we write this word).Now there's just a big circle.And the "t" changes the number of sides it has. the problem is that it looks like each number of sides need a special grid size, ex. 5 sides need grid 19*19, and I want to know if there's a way to set the grid size in coding.Also I dont put channel shift caus there's only 3 colors.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You have made a pretty nice preset, and I really like the movement in it, although I think it's just slightly too bright.<br />
      <br />
      You can improve the speed by not using replace/replace effect lists. Maybe it makes your preset easier to understand from the avs editor, but it actually doesn't do anything, so you should take out all the components from those effect lists, and delete the ELs.<br />
      Also you can decrease the gridsize of the first dm, disable it's bilinear filtering (and inserting a slow fadeout to compensate), remove the brigtness and the first and the third unique color, without any real loss of quality.<br />
      Finally it's possible to do some code optimizations, such as calculating color on frame instead of on poit in the first ssc, and it's possible to save the 2nd dm for the /pi calculation (in case you didn't know division is rather slow and should be used as little as possible in per pixel og per point code).<br />
      <br />
      After those optimizations are done you'll probable get about 30 % increase in the framerate. If you want to improve the speed further, you'll have to try to decrease the amount of effect lists and the movements with bilinear filtering.<br />
      <br />
      About the line on the left: It is caused by the fact that the dm tries to smoothen a transition from y = (0*t+m)/pi to y = (2pi*t+m)/pi, which will never look any good (unless you use movement instead, but that wouldn't be dynamic). To fix it you can remove the y code with: y=(asin(sin(r))*t+m)/$pi;<br />
      you should however note that this will give a mirror effect, which you may not like.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached a zip containing 2 files, both with the mentioned optimizations, and one with the fix for the line.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok I got 2 new versions now. It seems that the line is not removable with "r*t" so I made a version that stays at 7 sides, so there's no line (in editor format). you can change the sides but you will need to change the grid size too. the 2nd version is with dummy's mirror version of the dynamove, and so i can put the "t" variable.<br />
      As for the low speed, it just dosen't work to delete all effects, it looks bad, and the speed is not so low caus you dont need to put the preset very big, its still nice in editor size. Finally, I found how to adjust the preset for normal song and its so simple that I feel really stupid, its all in the adjustable blend.Adjust it to your songs and its perfect, well almost. If someone find out a way to delete that line without changing the effect, please say it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nothing too special, but it's better than the regular noob bull.<br />
      <br />
      Btw. Try the 3rd version with XOR selected in the Effect List containing the Blurs and the Color Clips. I like it best that way.</p>
