      <p class="post-content"><strong>RIP Winamp</strong><br />
      thanks to onionring for pointing me to this article<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/20/5126666/winamp-media-player-shutting-down-after-over-15-years" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/20/5...-over-15-years</a><br />
      <br />
      to be honest, i'm not even shocked at all. i remember winamp as my long-time favourite player, but that was also a long time ago. in the end, it became just a tool for me to play visuals, but my primary audioplayer had been something else for a long time (these days i mostly listen to spotify).<br />
      <br />
      my real concern is the forums, what will happen to it? it's such a great resource outside the winamp discussion, it would be a great loss.<br />
      <br />
      edit: now that there's an announcement on the winamp page, it's clear that the forums will be gone as well. it would be nice if some forum admin would give us access to all the posts of the avs forum, but the move to announce the winamp a month before the shutdown makes me doubt it will happen. great move, aol!</p>

      <p class="post-content">That makes the both of us, I've known winamp for almost a decade and started using it like 6 or so years ago. I guess this was just a matter of time before this happened, first with AVS, then Winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well from what i've heard, a number of people are scraping the forums and everything else but as far as importing things go, i'd expect it'll have to be a manual process but i really don't know.</p>
