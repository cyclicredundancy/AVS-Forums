      <p class="post-content"><strong>What settings are you using??</strong><br />
      Hey guys.....I have been an AVS fan for years and have always had problems with the usual avs crashing.....I have read everything in here.....have tried every idea posted in the forums and thought I would just post this to see what settings everyone is running...<br />
      <br />
      Im running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit<br />
      Winamp 5.56<br />
      Turned off Aero when winamp runs just like everyone said.....<br />
      Have AVS 2.81b, 2.81d, Cockos 2.9's.......<br />
      I have tried them all.......they all crash at some point......Sometimes I can run for an hour....sometimes it will crash right away.<br />
      I completely understand the state of AVS with Winamp but was just curious what settings most of you guys were using on your systems.....I hope not to piss anyone off in here.....Just LOVE my AVS and wish I could get it to run somewhat stable......<br />
      <br />
      Thanks alot for any postings.....:D<br />

      <p class="post-content">Welcome to the forums!<br />
      <br />
      AVS has never been completely stable. It just crashes now and then, we learned to save often. Noone's been able to detect the cause of the crashes yet.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://warrior-of-the-light.net/content/AVS%20QSG%20Full.zip" target="_blank">here's</a> my quickstart guide for optimal settings. It's from 2006 and by now multi-core processors are the norm. So The only thing I'd change is to <i>en</i>able SMP support. Still, don't expect to double your performance with it.<br />
      <br />
      I'm running windows XP.<br />
      <br />
      edit: you're running the 32-bit version. never mind the part about dualcore systems then.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Warrior for the info.....Will give your ideas a shot. One last question....you say we learn to save often....what do you mean by this?<br />
      Thanks again...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Imagine working on a preset for a few hours nonstop, and just when you're about to save... AVS crashes and you've done it all for nothing.<br />
      There is very little that could ruin my mood more than that.</p>
