      Yes, friends, my second AVS pack, entitled Kaleidopak, is ready for action! It's been uploaded to my space...now to see if it gets published!<br />
      <br />
      I hope that those who downloaded my first pack, "Transitions", liked it, as I found it to be a good pack of visualizations myself - then again, I would - I made them, didn't I?<br />
      <br />
      Um...that's all I can think of to say, so...um...have a nice day?<br />

      <p class="post-content">It makes more sense to publish something like this when the pack has been published. No one cares if it has been submitted, we want to download it and junk.</p>

      <p class="post-content">a) Attach it to your post (though I believe you can't attach when editing, unless there was an attachment in the first place: you'll have to reply)<br />
      b) Post it to an instant-publishing site (e.g. deviantart)<br />
      <br />
      Kind of pointless to say "My pack is done!" when we can't look at it, right? ;)</p>

      <br />
      wheeeeee a cheap &amp; easy way to increase forum posts! :p<br />
      <br />
      But why post something like this in the first place? Do you think we will monitor the new components list and wait until your pack shows up in it? :rolleyes:

      <p class="post-content">Nobady is Dutch<br />
      <br />
      We're in the same class at school (i kinda got him into the winamp community)<br />
      <br />
      but Nobady, as i will call you now, it doesn't really matter how many post you have... okay, it looks cool, but having 100,000 posts doesn't make you a better man than having only one... it's what you saying in your posts that counts.<br />
      <br />
      And no, English isn't your strongest point, but i suppose everybody must have noticed that by now.. (He's sitting right next to me now)</p>
