		Why didn't someone reproduce the Flurry Screensaver from MacOS X? <br />

		maybe because WINamp is for windows and therefor its unlikely that a avser sees that screensaver?

		Or because there's already a <a href="http://www.maddogsw.com/flurry/" target="_blank">Windows version</a> and therefore no need to torture avs to produce something that's almost, but not quite, entirely unlike the original.

		Seriously, when you compare it to what most of the AVS artists here have been doing lately:<br />
<br />
First, how hard could it be to make something like that?<br />
<br />
Second, why bother with something so simple? AVS can do pretty much anything, after all, and we artists have been doing &quot;pretty much anything&quot; with AVS. There are some truly beautiful and unique works out there, much more so than this screensaver.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it turns out to be relatively simple to grab that source code and port it to AVS. I know I could do it; all I'm missing is a reason to!

		actually, in my early days, I saw this screensaver and tried to reproduce it!<br />
I ended up with something that was better imo back in the days.<br />
<br />
[if you'd bother to see it, <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/17359885/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/view/17359885/</a> and go for &quot;Blackbird II&quot;...but don't judge me by this, it's like ages ago!]<br />
<br />
and Steven, [I don't know if any of the people above have seen the saver in action] the movement [of the arms] isn't THAT simple, it sometimes leaves some sort of seeds behind that have arms for itself and stuff...<br />
<br />
So to answer the original question, yes someone has tried but not succeded! :)<br />
<br />
/edit: i don't think it's crap! AVS-in-2005-seen it's crap, but I dig the movement and looks
