		Made this one in about 2.5 hrs...i think it's damn cool......<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Attached 2 remixes, both of which are a lot faster than the original... &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Actually attached it this time &lt;/edit&gt;

		The SSC's go nice together, but there are a bit too many colors.  Try restricting the band of colors used.(Or making them all in the same basic scheme).

		Nice scopes.<br />
<br />
The middle part is a bit cluttered and the sub-2 blended scopes doesn't exactly add much...<br />
<br />
Just needs a little cleaning up (somehow... :/ ), then it'll be better.

		The scopes do look nice and i have no problem with the colors, i think they fit in. My only problem with it is the onbeat change of the scope, isn't there a way to smoothen it up without losing beat response?

		i liked the speed remix the best, it looked cleaner, it looked less &quot;random shit thrown together&quot; type thing. what are you talking about anubis? The colours look good.

		Tuggummi: I thought it needed a bit of &quot;shock&quot; to it, and smoothing it out is a PAIN IN THE ASS for this kind of scope.  You have to keep the old coefficient of R in memory, then fade between the two...you can't simply change the coefficient smoothly, or else...bad things happen.  Check this out:<br />
<br />
init: n=576; tpi=acos(-1)*2;<br />
beat:<br />
frame: t=t+0.01; coef=sin(t)*4+9;<br />
pixel:<br />
r=i*tpi; d=sin(r*coef)/3+0.5;<br />
x=sin(r)*d; y=cos(r)*d;<br />
<br />
...Bad things happen... (or at least I think they do, I haven't checked the scope ;) )<br />
<br />
And the colors do look cool...I dun care what you say :p<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; fixed the scope &lt;/edit&gt;

		The colors are nice, but there are too many of them in the center.

		That's amazing.  Nice results though.  But like I said - speed it up a bit.  It will make it run so much smoother.
