      i was messing around with the avs editor for awhile and came up with this odd blue particle with a red trail and the other particles on top of it expose the blue through the red... its wierd.. its fun.<br />
      <br />
      its not the most spectacular thing, but i think it looks cool<br />
      <br />
      i call it mistery blu.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>yeah...</strong><br />
      I tend not to modify other people's presets. I may look into their syntax and formulae, but only to see how to do certain things.<br />
      <br />
      Any preset I put out in a pack, is guaranteed started from scratch.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Just the way I like to do it.</p>

      Hey Scarface,<br />
      <br />
      I really like your blurpacks, they gave me tons of ideas! And yes, My second Pack (I skipped the first) has been published on Bluesphere, and my third has been uploaded... I just have to get the images ready before sending it in to Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone who hasn't checked out bluesphere yet should, it's a great site!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hey..</strong><br />
      Not too shabby..<br />
      <br />
      I like it.. Keep it up.. ALthough spending an entire night on one preset sounds a little intense to me (I usually fiddle with one, then move onto another then come bak to the original at some point with a fresh perspective and new ideas..) but, hey, if it works for you, then great..<br />
      <br />
      It definitely works... Not a piece de resistance, but definitely a solid start..!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>cpu useage (invisman's avs)</strong><br />
      reason why it uses so much cpu useage because the second superscope streches off the screen and its sort keeps over laping itself OR continues off til its cycle comes back like example x=atan(10*t)+i (not surte itll do it but the tans arent really the pro choice of my avs's just the cos and sin) which might make its go off screen.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D Projections</strong><br />
      3D superscopes may be fun, but I'm still looking for someone who can beat the 3D projections (DynMovs) in Whacko AVS II (esp. Zero-G Maze) in terms of complexity of the environments.<br />
      <br />
      -----------<br />
      And in good WinAMP forums tradition, here's the obligatory <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=78028" target="_blank">obligatory link to my own work</a>.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Unconed..</strong><br />
      Your presets had my mouth watering and my jaw clenching.. You have absolutely mastered the superscope.. When I checked out your title preset for WHACKO AVS 1, and realised that the whole "UNCONED" was made up of superscopes, I nearly lost consciousness.<br />
      <br />
      In Whacko AVS II, your superscope projections and 3d environments are absolutely magnificent. While some presets are objective as in some will like them and others may not, yours are absolutely, undeniably exquisite.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully, sometime I'll be able to do as much, still got a lot to learn though!<br />
      <br />
      If youwant to check out my work, I'd appreciate any thoughts youmight have, the links are in my sig.<br />
      <br />
      Pardon my ranting and raving, but you totally blew my mind with your preset packs, keep up the great effects!</p>
