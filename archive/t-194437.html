		WOW! I just completed it: My first &quot;real 3D Preset&quot;!!!!!<br />
<br />
Well, i think i'm just happy about the 3D-looking ssc's and the swingin DM-effect written by myself! And the best part is: i understand the whole thing!<br />
Guess that's the point, why i've never made a preset on that &quot;coding-level&quot; before: I just had no idea in this transformation stuff -and copying someone else's work doesn't bring me any advance...<br />
<br />
So, here it goes. Would be glad if you could have a look on it and post your opinions. Perhaps anyone has got some ideas about improvement...<br />
(e.g. how to fix the interleave background to the &quot;corridor&quot;, so that those squared pattern don't break on the edges when changing the screensize)

		Great scopes for a non-3d 3dscope!! congrats.<br />
<br />
No matter how, you can't work around the 3d rotation and 3d/2d translation. I suggest you start with altering someone else's preset to understand the meaning of the code better.Just try following the variables if you really want to know what they do.<br />
<br />
Then, when you have a general idea of what does what, fill in the names of the variables usually use.<br />
<br />
Usual stuff:<br />
x1(y,z) defines the base of the scope - variables: i is usually only used here<br />
x2,x3(y,z) rotates the scope - variables: xc,xs<br />
x4(y,z) moves(shifts) the scope - variables: mx<br />
x(y) translates 3d to 2d<br />
<br />
There's a good tutorial written by pIR, and a primer by Atero that you really should read first.

		Thanks for the feedback and tips!<br />
<br />
I'm 'playing' with avs for 1-2 years now, but i don't do more than playing. Have a look at some of my old presets attached - has nothing to do with the presets made by some other people after such long time.<br />
Nevertheless, i do know the basics of avs quite well (and quite long). But recently i wanted to get to know more about making rather 'demanding' presets, because i 'upgraded' Winamp from 2.91 to 5.05 and saw some realy great presets  :eek:.<br />
<br />
For that kind of 'further education' the primer by atero is just the right thing. (thanks for the tip :) )! Is there anything special about it? That thread seems a little bit confusing (to me): i only download broken or incomplete versions.... :confused: <br />
<br />
Well, here my 'favourites' go :D

		Warning! Sarcasm ahead!<br />
<br />
I know you had a look at my presets! None of you can get around of posting some feedback! The motto is &quot;give and get&quot;.<br />
Well, surely only till i finally achieve world domination! Then under my unmercy reign as the evilest Lord (eviler than you ever were able to think of) it will be more like you give ME everything you have and i will ungrateful take it all away!<br />
<br />
Harrr Harrr Arrrr!!!! Arrrr, Muarrrrharrrrrharr!<br />
<br />
Joking apart! It realy would be very kind if i can get some comments. To me those presets do mean something (not only beacause of investing much time), so it would be nice to see what some other eyes think of it. And i always welcome suggestions for improvement.<br />
Thanks very much! <br />
<br />

		bah...it's been a while since i wrote the primer but i'm pretty sure it dealt with 3d in a fairly crappy way.  i've pretty much dropped avsprimer altogether, although i've worked on it intermittently recently.<br />
<br />
i might upload a proper 3d tutorial soon, now that i'm thinking about it...

		That would be great! Cause the 3D part is actually the thing i'm trying to compete with.
