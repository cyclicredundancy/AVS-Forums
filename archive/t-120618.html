<div class="posttext">What do you do for AVS inspiration ?<br />
<br />
Yes thats the question<br />
<br />
I've been reading textbooks on maths physics and chemistry and researching things like artistic concepts and colour schemes.<br />
<br />
I'm running a bit dry at the moment, probably because of a lack of time aswell. I'm looking for opinions on this questions for help in my parched period. What do you do?<br />

I used to chong down a bit of &quot;electric parsley&quot; echem .. when I was younger and VIS back in the day of the first Giess plugins, I would stare at the screen for like a half an hour an the when I looked away every thing around me would be moving and swirling around for about ten minutes.  yeh they were the days.. mind you I live in a city where it is decriminalised. I might have to go into the hills and find some... might just send me to sleep tho, any other suggestions??</div></div><hr />

Main thing I do for inspiration: Think of something that you'd like to do, and hasn't been done before, and do it.  That simple.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought you might have said something to do with fractal concepts or new algorithms that have just been discovered. It's odviously where you get your inspiration from.<br />

Actually I think I'm getting somewhere. There's heaps of stuff on net actually.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just mess around 'till something good happens, then I develop it. As a result, I make presets slowly. Heck, it's been about 8 months since I released my pack, and I still only have about 8 release quality presets. Jeriko has released 4 packs in that time, Atero released 2, and they were all bigger than mine will be.<br />

Best AVS story:<br />
My sister had her theater arts class over. We went out to the woods, got baked, and watched this for about 3 hours.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey Killahbite, I took some of your advise.. And I totaly went psycadelic if you like psycadelic prests this is for you. I almost got the golden spiral.. woh this looks cool in full screen it hits about 20 fps with 640x480  on my 1 ghz machine with it's wicked 100mhz memory....:eek: <br />
<br />
There's a curling beat detecting spiral that uses the spectrum in instead of waveform to good effect. I like to call it a worm hole with the worm that got stuck in it .. :p <br />
<br />
I had a head full of (pot)s n pans when I coded it so dont be suprised if itz all over the shop. I think my signature had something to do with the coding. I know I should really post this in the presets forum, but its got do do with this thread.<br />
<br />
I should really learn to code DM's DS's and DDM's soon I'm gonna start today. So far I've only used SSC's and user definded Movements, I just never get sick of playing wityh SSC's<br />

i guess i actually take inspiration from many various sources (music, books, websites, movies... anything goes). i enjoy smoking, but i wouldnt really go for that cliche that smoking pot inspires me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I get most of my inspiration at random times.  I might be sitting in a restaurant and have an idea for a new preset.  Also, a couple of my presets have been based on some weird dreams.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Inspiration is stirred by motivation. Find out what motivates you - and you will find out what inspires you. The more you motivate yourself - the happier you'll be in life trust me. (shit I sound like I should be recording this and selling it on an infomercial)!!<br />
<br />
BTW weed is pretty good for visualising - If you really wanna be inspired by a drug - try peppertree extract. Its a natural psycadellic which makes you visualise fast (superfast) and super clear. But thats only if your into that sorta stuff.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">My inspiration is... Well, it's never consistent. Sometimes I decide to make a flow preset, 3d-SSC-based (or 2d), 3d DM, such and such, and carry them out - If it doesn't turn out good, I dump them (Shoulda saved them in some sort of trash folder, but now not saving them is a bad habit of mine)... If it turns out interesting, I keep it in for a bit longer and improve it... If it turns out good, off into the pack (Though I can always remove it) (Yes, there's always that further improvement stage). Most of the time, my new presets are turnouts from experiments or doodling around... My laziness counts in why I rarely make an actual preset that I spend dedicated time at...<br />
If I saw something cool, I might also try to reproduce it in AVS (The truth : Never tried).<br />
<br />
Oh, and I never smoked, never drank alcohol (Except for that liquor-filled chocolate... I only took one, I swear!) (Mild dizziness as a side-effect).</div></div><hr />

Huh? :igor:<br />
I swear... you're either a mind reader or we have something in common, because i also look something on the street or in TV or whatever and suddenly get this huge inspiration to do &quot;THAT&quot; in avs. I especially see a lot of cool effects used in old console games that i would love to see in avs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2003, 12:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Tug, I think a lot of people have this in common because I've seen many effects in avs that I have seen on television or in a movie.  This is what I like about avs because you can take something that is already good and make it 10 times better by making it react with music.  Look at what Tonic has done - even though it is really simple he has made hundreds of dollars by doing it because of how much better it does look.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree with tuggummi, most of my inspiration comes from my 45 min, traffic jammed drive to school. <br />
<br />
though i don't do drugs, (though most of the time i sound like i'm on somthing)<br />
i do occasionally drink.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I usually get my inspirations from other AVS artists. Althought it's only like: &quot;hmm, nice stuff with moving particles &amp; colorfade, haven't used those in a while maybe I'll give a shot with them now..&quot; and I play around with 'em until I get something pretty, usually I figure something better besides the moving particles or whatever, so they doesn't even remind that preset I got my inspiration from :) <br />
<br />
I'm also one of those who gets their inspiration from what they sees in a tv or in the streets, tho I've never succeeded convert my visions to AVS...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">not good graffiti, it all says &quot;sozard&quot; for some reason, but people who stand around trying to figure out grafiti are people with less lives than the average moth who end up mugged and/or hit by cars.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes Ive been thinking for quite some time about how to simulate graffitti in a music reactive. Im not sure if AVS is the right tool, but I've seen an awesome affect achieved on some wierd rap clip I saw years ago. <br />
The graff was in plain black which makes it a bit easier to emulate. <br />
The problem is trying to mathematically recreate graffiti?? So far my attempts haven't been too successful. hhhmmmm...</div></div><hr />
