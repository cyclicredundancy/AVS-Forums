      What do you do for AVS inspiration ?<br />
      <br />
      Yes thats the question<br />
      <br />
      I've been reading textbooks on maths physics and chemistry and researching things like artistic concepts and colour schemes.<br />
      <br />
      I'm running a bit dry at the moment, probably because of a lack of time aswell. I'm looking for opinions on this questions for help in my parched period. What do you do?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">I just mess around 'till something good happens, then I develop it. As a result, I make presets slowly. Heck, it's been about 8 months since I released my pack, and I still only have about 8 release quality presets. Jeriko has released 4 packs in that time, Atero released 2, and they were all bigger than mine will be.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey Killahbite, I took some of your advise.. And I totaly went psycadelic if you like psycadelic prests this is for you. I almost got the golden spiral.. woh this looks cool in full screen it hits about 20 fps with 640x480 on my 1 ghz machine with it's wicked 100mhz memory....:eek:<br />
      <br />
      There's a curling beat detecting spiral that uses the spectrum in instead of waveform to good effect. I like to call it a worm hole with the worm that got stuck in it .. :p<br />
      <br />
      I had a head full of (pot)s n pans when I coded it so dont be suprised if itz all over the shop. I think my signature had something to do with the coding. I know I should really post this in the presets forum, but its got do do with this thread.<br />
      <br />
      I should really learn to code DM's DS's and DDM's soon I'm gonna start today. So far I've only used SSC's and user definded Movements, I just never get sick of playing wityh SSC's<br />

      <p class="post-content">Inspiration is stirred by motivation. Find out what motivates you - and you will find out what inspires you. The more you motivate yourself - the happier you'll be in life trust me. (shit I sound like I should be recording this and selling it on an infomercial)!!<br />
      <br />
      BTW weed is pretty good for visualising - If you really wanna be inspired by a drug - try peppertree extract. Its a natural psycadellic which makes you visualise fast (superfast) and super clear. But thats only if your into that sorta stuff.<br />

      <p class="post-content">My inspiration is... Well, it's never consistent. Sometimes I decide to make a flow preset, 3d-SSC-based (or 2d), 3d DM, such and such, and carry them out - If it doesn't turn out good, I dump them (Shoulda saved them in some sort of trash folder, but now not saving them is a bad habit of mine)... If it turns out interesting, I keep it in for a bit longer and improve it... If it turns out good, off into the pack (Though I can always remove it) (Yes, there's always that further improvement stage). Most of the time, my new presets are turnouts from experiments or doodling around... My laziness counts in why I rarely make an actual preset that I spend dedicated time at...<br />
      If I saw something cool, I might also try to reproduce it in AVS (The truth : Never tried).<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and I never smoked, never drank alcohol (Except for that liquor-filled chocolate... I only took one, I swear!) (Mild dizziness as a side-effect).</p>

      I swear... you're either a mind reader or we have something in common, because i also look something on the street or in TV or whatever and suddenly get this huge inspiration to do "THAT" in avs. I especially see a lot of cool effects used in old console games that i would love to see in avs ;)

      <p class="post-content">Tug, I think a lot of people have this in common because I've seen many effects in avs that I have seen on television or in a movie. This is what I like about avs because you can take something that is already good and make it 10 times better by making it react with music. Look at what Tonic has done - even though it is really simple he has made hundreds of dollars by doing it because of how much better it does look.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with tuggummi, most of my inspiration comes from my 45 min, traffic jammed drive to school.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I usually get my inspirations from other AVS artists. Althought it's only like: "hmm, nice stuff with moving particles &amp; colorfade, haven't used those in a while maybe I'll give a shot with them now.." and I play around with 'em until I get something pretty, usually I figure something better besides the moving particles or whatever, so they doesn't even remind that preset I got my inspiration from :)<br />
      <br />
      I'm also one of those who gets their inspiration from what they sees in a tv or in the streets, tho I've never succeeded convert my visions to AVS...</p>

      <p class="post-content">not good graffiti, it all says "sozard" for some reason, but people who stand around trying to figure out grafiti are people with less lives than the average moth who end up mugged and/or hit by cars.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes Ive been thinking for quite some time about how to simulate graffitti in a music reactive. Im not sure if AVS is the right tool, but I've seen an awesome affect achieved on some wierd rap clip I saw years ago.<br />
      The graff was in plain black which makes it a bit easier to emulate.<br />
      The problem is trying to mathematically recreate graffiti?? So far my attempts haven't been too successful. hhhmmmm...</p>
