      Wanted to post a couple of new presets and repost a couple adjusted ones. Guess it's kinda like a minipack but not really. So let me know what you guys think.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and make sure you get the bitmaps into the right folder or the preset using them is just gonna look stupid. And speaking of that one, yeah there's no background. I like it like that and it saves FPS.<br />
      <br />
      Update: Left a piece of unused code in one of the presets. Fixed it. Updated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i gotta give it to you, <i>Spherical Conductor</i> is the first fast "high tech" preset without any visible ugly edges :up: Great job on that.<br />
      <br />
      I also liked <i>Blue Gill</i> very much.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice stuff here, even those techy presets look great. <i>blue gill</i> reminds me of my own stuff, yet <i>painters algorithm</i> is my favorite here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Verra nice :) I'd have to give my vote to Spherical Conductor, although Blue Grill did reflect the music eerily well. Maybe it was just chance but damn. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Spherical Conductor - now that's what I call c00l! Really the preset is very nice and has a great texture. Blue Gill also is great. Keep up the work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice job. Great colors on Blue Gill, and the buffer blended DM on Spherical Conductor looks awesome (although I think you could do more with the color scheme; the current green and blue is kind of boring)!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I bug was found in Blue Gill when you change the window size. I'll release it again later with the fix but if you want to fix it just change the code in the second effect list frame section to:<br />
      <br />
      x=if(equal(w1,w)*equal(h1,h),0,1);<br />
      enabled=x;<br />
      w1=w;<br />
      h1=h;<br />
      <br />
      and that should take care of it. Thanks again for the awesome comments!</p>
