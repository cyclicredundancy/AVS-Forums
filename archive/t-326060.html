      <p class="post-content"><strong>Huge favor needed from avs collectors for a collector</strong><br />
      I am a long time collector of avs presets, and have been doing so for about 10 years. Although I have no skill at coding, I have a great appreciation for the talented artists in avs. Unfortunately a hard drive crash had me lose many, many presets and packs, and when I went to Deviantart to get them back, I discovered that a server crash had deleted many (a couple of years worth) avs presets and packs permanently off the server. Fortunately through the Winamp website, and Visbot (I recently was able to get the Visbot avs archive via torrent) and the active portion of the Deviantart site I was able to retreive and back up about 75% of the presets I lost. Still, there are a great number of presets and packs that I am looking to replace. Who I am looking for is an avid collector from the Deviantart website over the last 10 years who keeps pretty much every preset they have ever downloaded. I am looking to recover the presets that have been wiped off the Deviantart servers from the fall 0f 2001 to about 2004. In particular I am looking for the following:<br />
      <br />
      Punkers (aka altIII): Paranormal Pack<br />
      Beatflowers Minipack<br />
      Any other single preset or pack posted by<br />
      Punkers or AltIII<br />
      <br />
      AVS King: Any single preset not posted in his packs (which I have recovered)<br />
      <br />
      Nixa: All presets/packs<br />
      <br />
      Nic01: All presets/packs<br />
      <br />
      Fenn Twins: All presets<br />
      <br />
      Misc: Any single presets published on the site that never were posted in a pack during the aformentioned time frame.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I have contacted the previous artists and they either have not responded or no longer have the files.<br />
      <br />
      So......if there is anybody out there with a collection more extensive than mine who is able to help me, please let me know...I am hoping some sort of file transfer can be used. I will reward any helpers quite handsomely. I am also willing to share my sorted collection of 7000+ presets with whoever is interested. Please pm me via this site.</p>

      iirc, you will find all presets by the fenn twins in the pack titled <a href="http://archive.visbot.net/yathosho/yi-another_thirteen-UNOFFICIAL.7z" target="_blank">another thirteen</a>. the pack was later deleted and some of the presets appeared in <i>hybrids</i> and <a href="http://archive.visbot.net/yathosho/yi-hybrids720.7z" target="_blank">hybrids 720&#194;&#176;</a>.<br />
      <br />
      the name "fenn twins" was a sort of a joke between a friend of mine and myself, the actual presets were mine.<br />
      <br />
      while we're at it, any chance you got one of these?<br />

      <p class="post-content">i've a feeling it's due to the link being a lzma2 encoded archive especially if other 7z archives are able to be opened so would look like the OP is using an older version of 7-Zip or any alternative archive manager which doesn't support lzma2.<br />
