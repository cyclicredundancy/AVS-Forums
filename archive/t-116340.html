-----------------------<br />
<br />
I saw a similar poster at a Trance/Goa party. The first version of this preset was published as Gleis 22, the name of the club. In this version the snail shell is drawn smoother and much faster.<br />
<br />
If you feel this preset to be too hectic for other music than Trance then<br />
- delete term 0.7*b in DynaMove,<br />
- slow down Fadeout velocity,<br />
- delete the waveform-based frame (first four SuperScopes).<br />
<br />
If you enable Trans/Water you'll get psychedelic colors and patterns.<br />

<br />
Hm, principally you're right. But then:<br />
<br />
1) I think it's much better than before.<br />
2) There wasn't very much attention to the other thread. So what's the point adding an updated preset if nobody is interested in the old post.<br />
3) I thought the new subject line would draw more attention.<br />
<br />
Anyway: I won't post from 13 Dec to 14 Jan as I'll be in GoOoOoOoAaAaAa!!<br />

<div class="posttext">Last version - although I'm quite sure that nobody will find it here ...<br />
<br />
If the shell is pointing away from the screen it should be drawn bottom up, if it's pointing towards you it should be drawn tip down. Otherwise the rotation looks a little bit unrealistic. I have changed that now. And I love it - almost as I love G ... oops ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's much better than the original. :up:<br />
<br />
It looks like there's a little glitch when it points away from the viewer. Almost like a ripple down the shell.<br />
<br />
The reason it should be in the same thread is so people who are not interested won't be seeing it over and over again. That atom thread a while ago is a perfect example.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good work with the v2 :up: (didn't check the first one :p)<br />
I really like the central scope and those border scopes are cool in my opinion too. I wouldn't advice using the water since water+flow=n00bish :p Maybe it's hella trippy, but it really does suck when you start to get more involved in avs.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, i see you can code and it's good you use your skills wisely and with style.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Finally somebody praises my snail! Yiiipppieeeehhhh! :D Thank you so much! It took hours to do that, although it's not as elaborate as your innovation pack which I downloaded yesterday. It's quite funny to program these presets. Unfortunately it's quite a distraction from writing my thesis. I don't have the time to get as good as you or UnC(l)oned (no typo) or all the other pros.<br />
<br />
Concerning water+flow: I didn't know that it's n00bish, it was just not the poster I saw before. That's the reason why I have disabled it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
Diesto<br />
<br />
PS: Is there any manual about all the Trans and Render effects? And what's about the effect lists? I avoid them because it makes the preset so slow. ... Okay, I avoid them because I don't know how to use them properly. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hehehe, yes avs can be pretty hypnotizing ;) (making the whole &quot;real&quot; world disappear in seconds :p)<br />
<br />
Im now pimping for Atero, but you should get AVS Primer (http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=114895) which explains some basic things in avs also you can check out the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567) for help.<br />
<br />
For me it seems weird that you know how to code 3D scopes, but not how to use Effect Lists :D :blah: :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Effect lists are like presets indise a preset. Effects in a preset will not affect things in an effect list (provided they are before the list). Using effect lists you can do simple things like fade things out at diferent speeds, or use them to occlude things like I did in my third atom preset.</div></div><hr />

Phew, not to late to delete these embarrassing lines. Thanks to UnConed who remebered me off my motto: The who can read gets more from life (okay, my English is not too good: Wer lesen kann hat mehr vom Leben!)<br />
<br />
But it was just because Atero didn't say what lines he was talking about. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, UnConed was the only one who read my lines.<br />
<br />
