      <br />

      <p class="post-content">1 scope:<br />
      <br />
      X axis for right channel,<br />
      Y axis for left channel.<br />
      <br />
      You can alter <b>gainleft</b> and <b>gainright</b>:<br />
      0.01 is very low, for loud music.<br />
      1.5 is very high, for soft music.<br />
      1.0 is normal.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Recent versions of Winamp have a broken AVS plugin, and so that preset doesn't work. It seems that the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=303684&amp;highlight=getosc" target="_blank">getosc function is broken</a>. If you want to use that preset, you need to revert AVS to 2.81d. It can be downloaded from:<br />

      <br />
      Also, the preset varies the gain (due to the "i" in point formulas), causing the image to pulse. I changed the point formulas to:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>y=-gainright*getosc(i,0,1);<br />x=gainleft*getosc(i,0,2);<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      This removes the pulsing, and by exchanging x and y and inverting y, the image is oriented properly for viewing the <a href="http://kapsi.fi/~jpa/stuff/other/youscope-wave.flac" target="_blank">YouScope flac file</a>. BTW. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1eNjUgaB-g" target="_blank">video of YouScope</a> on a real oscilloscope.<br />
      <br />
      I'm attaching the preset with these changes.

      You're right, those first "i"'s shouldn't be there.<br />

      Thanks a TON for the X-Y scope. As a recording artist it helps a crapload! I took the liberty of souping it up though without taking away from the purpose of it. I highly recommend anyone downloading the X-Y scope and can't thank you enough!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>My remix preset</strong><br />
      Just to let yall know. Upon recent discovery, the polarization is backwards on the preset I uploaded, as well as the "modified" version. Since the L and R are on the left and bottom side, it should actually be reversed. Change the R to L and the L to R. Phase scopes generally have the X Y (or L R) on the top center for the left side, and the right center for the right side, so it's reversed when the display is on the opposite side. Took me a minute when I recorded a new song to realize wait a minute... But this is on the left. :P Just to make sure, I loaded up sound forge and found that indeed we had the modified polarization backwards. The scope works as normal, just the text was in the wrong places. Woot! And glad ya like the remix. lol. I like eye-candy as long as it's moderate, and I highly recommend getting this plugin, whichever one you wish, but it's VERY useful when you make music and use Winamp to listen to stuff.<br />
      <br />
      Sincerely,<br />

      [ &gt;] added + and - to the text to make clear what goes where.<br />
      (thanks to koqlb)<br />
      [ &gt;] added aspect ratio and lines<br />
      [ &gt;] added a button (click in the lower left of the AVS window) to reverse L and R<br />
