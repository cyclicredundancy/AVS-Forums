      I need to get those ol'good ape utilities for AVS... I whish i could also find a direct video input ape so i could use my webcam or other broadcasts. Haven't played AVS for years!<br />
      Thought... Do you believe it could be possible to use AVS in a VSTeffect wrapper to use inside FLstudio?<br />
      <br />
      Managed to use an avi with goebish's video player... But i'm pretty sure that a direct input plugin exist or could exist...<br />
      <br />
      AVS seems to still be the best tool to make awesome effects on video and all... I have thrust in it!. Really whish some devs could make it 2x more powerful with the public sourcecodes ah... :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm.... Interresting thought! I managed to get a grab only on a few ape files. Googling ape + winamp/nullsoft +avs gives me senseless results like "monkey audio ape files" "avs video converter" "avs codecs" it really sucks indeed. Maybe nullsoft would have to rename AVS to *.NSavs and ape to *.NsApe ? (NS: nullsoft)<br />
      <br />
      I tried a "ape" search in the winamp.com plugin section search and it makes no good results... Gives stuff like "tape" and uselessnesses... Any trick could be revealed?<br />
      <br />
      Oh... Have you heard about something "picture III" module that could load PNG+alpha?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup... You were right... This webcam extension isnt anything easy to use... It doesnt recognize my "onboard" gateway webcam (that is on top of my screen)<br />
      I expected something that could also use any playback source like a TV capture card's image or anything VLC or MPC calls a "device" :) I'll have to stick with pre-chewed .Avi files with uncompressed codec (xvid, mpg, divx... no codecs work with the avi player modules other than raw uncompressed.... :( )<br />
      Got a clue about using png and pngs's alpha channel?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i don't think there's an APE that supports PNG and unconed (the author of picture2.ape) has quit AVS (and the windows platform) long ago. if at all, i guess goebish might be the only one who <i>could</i> write something like that. too bad there's no source-code for the picture2.ape to build upon.<br />
      <br />
      ps: i'm pretty sure somebody posted a list of all available APEs before</p>
