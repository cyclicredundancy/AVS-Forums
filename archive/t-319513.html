<div class="posttext">I need to get those ol'good ape utilities for AVS... I whish i could also find a direct video input ape so i could use my webcam or other broadcasts. Haven't played AVS for years!<br />
Thought... Do you believe it could be possible to use AVS in a VSTeffect wrapper to use inside FLstudio?<br />
<br />
Managed to use an avi with goebish's video player... But i'm pretty sure that a direct input plugin exist or could exist... <br />
<br />
AVS seems to still be the best tool to make awesome effects on video and all... I have thrust in it!. Really whish some devs could make it 2x more powerful with the public sourcecodes ah... :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm.... Interresting thought! I managed to get a grab only on a few ape files. Googling ape + winamp/nullsoft +avs gives me senseless results like &quot;monkey audio ape files&quot; &quot;avs video converter&quot; &quot;avs codecs&quot; it really sucks indeed. Maybe nullsoft would have to rename AVS to *.NSavs and ape to *.NsApe ? (NS: nullsoft)<br />
<br />
I tried a &quot;ape&quot; search in the winamp.com plugin section search and it makes no good results... Gives stuff like &quot;tape&quot; and uselessnesses... Any trick could be revealed?<br />
<br />
Oh... Have you heard about something &quot;picture III&quot; module that could load PNG+alpha?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mucks</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th May 2010, 07:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yup... You were right... This webcam extension isnt anything easy to use... It doesnt recognize my &quot;onboard&quot; gateway webcam (that is on top of my screen)<br />
I expected something that could also use any playback source like a TV capture card's image or anything VLC or MPC calls a &quot;device&quot; :) I'll have to stick with pre-chewed .Avi files with uncompressed codec (xvid, mpg, divx... no codecs work with the avi player modules other than raw uncompressed.... :( ) <br />
Got a clue about using png and pngs's alpha channel?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i don't think there's an APE that supports PNG and unconed (the author of picture2.ape) has quit AVS (and the windows platform) long ago. if at all, i guess goebish might be the only one who could write something like that. too bad there's no source-code for the picture2.ape to build upon.<br />
<br />
ps: i'm pretty sure somebody posted a list of all available APEs before</div></div><hr />

There should be support foundations that secures hardworking people's permanant place on the web... Removing them the burden of renting a server for years.<br />
