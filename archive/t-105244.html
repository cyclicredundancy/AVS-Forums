			<strong>Megapak 2 coming soon...</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I've started work on my Megapak 2...and I hope that it can be better than my first.  I've been obsurving others and have picked up a few things, and I have some tricks up my sleeve.  here's a few I've made so far...Pretty good ones too.<br />
<br />
Any comments for me or any ideas of stuff I should make?

		That ape is so damn good.<br />
<br />
I have to say that those presets were quite a bit more original than your last pack. The last one looked pretty cool but I think that was down to the APE more than anything else (I really hate the timescope - but thats just me).<br />
<br />
As for things to make, I would recommend you make something using a custom superscope or dynamic movement. It may be tricky at first but once you get into using them its just a matter of time and practice before you start chucking out some mental work.<br />
<br />
Keep making them!

		I NEED YOUR IDEAS!!!<br />
<br />
Something for me to work off...My mind is dry from the first...<br />
<br />
I have just made a really good black hole-type preset that looks awesome, using a new .ape posted on the main AVS board.  Meant for low FPS's, so be warned if it is REALLY SLOW, that's how it is to be played.

		Too true. Remeber, it's the quality that counts. A pack of 200 bad presets won't get marked as well as one with 5 really good ones.<br />
<br />
As for advice, try messing with other (or old) presets. See what you can make them do. Maybe don't use a standard fade. Use a really simple effect but fade it in a odd way.

1: I think that El-Vis has already done that with hellfire (one that looks like sauron from LOTR)<br />
<br />
2: What the <i>Hell</i> are you talking about?
