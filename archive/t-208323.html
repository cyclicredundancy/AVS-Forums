			<strong>new tutorial?</strong><br />
		
		

		i think it would be nice in addition to actually add a tutorial (or some links) and to stop n00bs (like me) from quad posting in the forums (:rolleyes: ) and maybe a feature to the search?

		i think everytime someone opens up a new account he/she has to read the FAQ (of course...) but then is only allowed to post here after passing a test about the stuff told in the FAQ. That would keep it seriously more bearable to read the threads here.

		I sort of agree with MATT, I think it would be nice if there was a locked sticky thread with a list of tutorials, I know the AVS Programming guide thread is sticky but its got a load of crap in it and peoples random replied.<br />
<br />
I would make such a thread myself but people are bound to post replies before it gets locked and stickied by a mod (i.e. you coned)

		actually that would be nice, except i meant in the AVS itself in winamp... as you open the &quot;AVS Editor&quot;, it would open a help guide? instead of stuff in ssc help &quot;new ssc tutorial goes here&quot; :p

		i could make an APE to achieve this one-time startup tutorial and maybe add a menu entry to open it later. nullsoft would just have to include that little file in the next winamp and we'd be relieved of a lot of noobs :)

		Yeah, that's it! I'd also write a story, cause i didn't even know of any community for more than 3 years! Of course, i've learned much more during my time here (btw THANK YOU ALL!!) than before. But anyways, i knew what did what and so on (just the basic things).

		My thought is that the current tutorials should <u>at least</u> be added to the FAQ first (url's).<br />
<br />
Reasons:<br />
1) My hope of 'better text to put here' (i.e. a new tutorial) actually being in that box is at zero now.<br />
2) Noobs wouldn't find this new tutorial just as they don't find the existing ones (which are good enough as they are now IMO), no matter in what other place it is. <br />
<br />
- at least then we can point them to the FAQ as it is the most asked question, but it isn't even in the FAQ.

		Well they would surely find it when it pops up everytime you open the avs-editor. ;)<br />
<br />
All in all i'm not that pessimistic: i still believe that there are people who read the faq (or at least parts of it ;)), so if there were such a list of links leading to tutorials it would make sense.<br />
The point is, that the bunch of &quot;sticky-info&quot; has to be updated. Who ever reads each of the 6 &quot;tips&amp;tricks&quot; pages?

		There is a rather large flaw in the tutorial APE idea... people would have to actually download it in the first place; what is the chance of that if they wont even bother reading the faq or searching for tutorials.

		but an ape that causes a pop-up-box giving decent information BEFORE the editor is actually accessible would be much more effective.<br />

		if i unserstood the idea correctly, it would be added to winamp, so that when you at first start the editor you get some information about avs like tutorials, help...<br />
So you don't have to put it into any pack. But since it's unclear (= very improbable) that there will be a new version of avs, this whole idea is probably unpracticable.

		wouldn't it be better if all of these lists were in the FAQ? surely a million stickies won't get noticed anymore than a single faq. maybe under &quot;i don't understand what a particular effect does?&quot; renamed (since there is already non specific effect related stuff under there) if not a link to the list of tutorials might be good (overkill?).

		It can be a chore to hack through a huge bloated faq, if people see a thread specific to their needs I would say they are more likely to click it. If something is requested a lot, its worth making it a seperate sticky imo
