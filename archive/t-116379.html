      <p class="post-content"><strong>Fix FPS for a preset</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      i have upgraded my pc form a amd 1GHz to a P4 2.4 GHz<br />
      now the presets run much faster (up to 60 fps in fullscreen and 90 fps in window), sometimes to fast... how can i set a fix fps-maximum for a preset without changing the AVS-settings?<br />
      <br />
      Thanx<br />
      GreatWho</p>

      <p class="post-content">Good question. I don't think that it is one with a simple answer though. The best way to do it IMO is to increase your resolution, now they look better and run smoothly too. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">But what if you are using a 800x600 resolution (since you have a 15" monitor and don't want to be blind) and still having a 1.77ghz Athlon XP +2100 running under? There just isn't enought space in the screen! :blah: :D :blah: :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Duh...you guys should know this. Options -&gt; Display. Hit 'Wait for retrace' if you don't want it going any faster than your monitor refresh rate, and/or lower the 'Windowed performance' bar.<br />
      <br />
      Also, changing resolution can drastically change the preset itself....</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I've had problems with presets looking different at different resolutions other than 320x240 (Especially where text is involved). So that's why we need unit scales for text, so it don't screw up at different resolutions.</p>

      Yeah hi,<br />
      <br />
      does AVS use more chip than graphics card??? any precentage stats or more info.. ????<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      BTW I got a (386 "Enhanced") "Mind you" running 2 Meg of memory it's the bomb...<br />
      <br />
      I used to play counterstrike and that was my handle... Untill I got my head checked now I do more constructive things..<br />
      <br />
      How many gigaflops does it do in a second sheeet I have no Idea. More than a beta video player thats for sure.........<br />
      <br />
      Does any of you AVS'ers write any music perhaps... Speak up !!!! Tried Fruity loops 3 hehehehe it's so cool<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>actually i was always using this setting, always seems to look better, but especially when the framerate is low.

      <p class="post-content">You can get graphics card tweakers that make your card wait for retrace so that you can turn it off in AVS to make it run faster without suffering from the cutting across the screen.<br />
      <br />
      Another thing to try is the performance slider, in display you can actually change the framerate with it.</p>
