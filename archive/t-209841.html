      <p class="post-content"><strong>Compiling APEs without VC++</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I'm just starting to try to fiddle around with programming APEs. The Problem is, I don't own VisualC++, so I chose Bloodshed Dev-C++ as my IDE.<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded the SDK and tried to compile the box tutorial and that worked. I changed the extension to ape and copied it to Plugins\avs in the Winamp dir. Now I have it in the AVS editor, but everytime I try to insert it, Winamp just crashes.<br />
      <br />
      Now I was wodering if anybody has gotten an APE to compile and work with anything else than VC++, or if there might be anything else I could be doing wrong (like: what libs do I have to link the APE to?).<br />
      <br />
      I would be really thankfull for any help.<br />
      <br />
      Lars</p>

      <p class="post-content">eep, if you get a copy of VC++ I'd just grit your teeth and use it because it will be a lot less hassle. The problem is that the project settings wont be applied if you use Borland, you basically need someone to tell you the project setting so you can port them into borland. I'd tell you them but im on a university computer not my own.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you could tell me the project settings, that would be nice. I'm quite broke at the moment, so I can't afford VC++, and I also don't want to use any pirated software.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry I only get online on university computers so I cant give the settings.<br />
      <br />
      I looked for a solution to this problem but i really cant find one, you really need some sort of project converter, if you can find a compiler that comes with one it would be a lot simpler. I know newer borland C's come with Visual C++ project converters, Borland Builder 5 and 6 for example, maybe you can find a copy of one of them?<br />
      <br />
      Maybe if you post a thread in the winamp development forum someone might have some better ideas</p>
