			<strong>I have tried everything.....</strong><br />
		
		

		I have read every one of the &quot;AVS on the secondary display&quot; problems, and mine curtails to none of the suggested solutions.  First off here's what I am running:<br />
PIII 800<br />
384 MB Ram<br />
GEForce 2 MX 400 (w/ S-video out)<br />
<br />
I used to be able to get the svideo out to go full screen using overlay mode, it was fast too.  Anywayz, I upgraded my Nvidia drivers to 2832.  Ever since then, I can get the AVS window to play on my TV (svideo), but when I switch to fullscreen using overlay, the desktop changes color, but no AVS.  It still goes fullscreen on my monitor tho.  I changed the secondary and primary displays, used mirroring/cloning and used the tv as an additonal desktop....nuthin'.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, same situation as others ie:  have a show coming up, got a big tv, and I'm spinning along with some other katz, wanna flash some shout outs and dj props....<br />
<br />
Thnx

		As far as I know (and in my experiance), the overlay signal can only go to one place. The primary display. Try setting the TV, or whatever you have hooked up to video out, as you primary display.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, if you has AVS set to desktop mode you'll be able to edit and manage the presets while they're running.

			<strong>maybe 2 video cards?</strong><br />
		
		

		I have an extra voodoo 3 card in my other box, might be able to use the voodoo card for the setup and use the tv out on the geforce for the output.   hmmmmmmmm  I'll have to try it.

		Um... why not just re-install the older drivers if you really need it that badly?

		If you know where to get the older Detonater drivers, sure, i'll try it.  The out of the box drivers were horrible.
