<div class="posttext">Hey, i've decided to post my first pack on here so you guys/gals can see if i'm any good at making presets.<br />
I think that i have few good presets and maybe some crappy ones but whatever.<br />
i've also included some other presets that I havent put int the pack yet.<br />
I would really like to have some feed back on my work and if you want you can remix one or two or five... just let me see it.<br />
I know i need a new intro and that tunel of the light is wrong (ish) but i corrected it and it looked crap.<br />
Yep, that will do for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice or Maybe a Cool Pack! ;)<br />
<br />
Drawing Is Fun is one of my favourite! Love to sketches with it. Yeah, released my tensions..<br />
<br />
On My Beach: Pretty cool (reminds me a preset made by PAK-9, Beanies), but least stuffs in it. Should be added more, btw it's great~<br />
<br />
p.s.: I like your style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2006, 15:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Not bad for the first pack I have seen from you... Some of the stuff is really awesome too imo. e.g. the pong game :)<br />
<br />
There is also some terrible noob shit in here too :P<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
<br />
1.) El-vis code does some cool stuff, but its usually a bit lazy and inefficient, better to steal from someone more recent for 3d code.<br />
<br />
2.) Your 'torus' is interesting, however, I am the torus king:<br />
http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2809465/<br />
<br />
3.) Keep creating! You rock so far :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Feel free to ask any avs/graphics related questions, I and the others here understand pretty much everything which has ever been done in AVS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah i second jheriko<br />
and i have corrected your torus code<br />
and i added aspect ratio correction.<br />
glancing at code i see that youre coding inefficient.<br />
keep in mind that a multiplication is much faster than a division so try to replace something like:<br />
vara=varb/varc;<br />
vard=vare/varc;<br />
varf=varg/varc;<br />
<br />
with:<br />
invarc=1/varc;<br />
vara=varb*invarc;<br />
vard=vare*invarc;<br />
varf=varg*invarc;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i liked aquarius, though i usually think that interactive presets are pretty useless (leaving aside the show off effect). black backgrounds are pretty boring too :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmm, really not bad for a first pack!<br />
I found &quot;On My Beach&quot; quite interesting, but perhaps you should add some more details to it like clouds or some common beach utensils. (btw: somehow it reminded me a bit of Pak's &quot;Beanies&quot; preset ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">QOALsoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th February 2006, 10:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks for all the nice coments about my presets people, it really nice to get good feedback,<br />
The n00b shite is being weeded out and will be gone in a week or two (if I put my mind to work)<br />
The thing with 'On my beach' is that I made it before I saw beanies (I hadn't downloaded any new avs packs for a while :))<br />
Thanks ASD5A for making my torus look the part!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Forum n00b in non-shit pack shocker&quot;<br />
<br />
I can see the headlines now.<br />
<br />
Well its about 100 times better than the average noob pack, on my beach is fun and Torus is fairly stylish (ignore the preset nazi's with rods up their tori).<br />
<br />
Be careful using too much text and interactivity, text in presets gets very irritating on re-watching. Interactivity is only worth putting in if it adds a significant dimension to the preset, rather than just being able to pick a stationary light position or invert the colours.<br />
<br />
Some other people have mentioned the noobier parts, which im sure u are aware of. Good first effort, keep learning and enjoy.<br />
<br />
P.S. Keep learning the code too... a preset's awesomeness is directly proportional to how much code is in it<br />
/runs</div></div><hr />

/waits for tug to reply to that :D<br />
<br />
Honestly, code isn't everything. Of course, you should always know how to handle the tools you're working with (and i'm not talking about the built-in effects btw), but since AVS'ing is also a kind of art you have to care for the esthetical aspects like color-schemes, style etc as well.</div></div><hr />

I think you forget noobs that only believe in aesthetics... will churn out noob presets.<br />
<br />
Balance must be achieved for the best AVS presets imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, completely ignoring code is bad. But only aming to develop the most complicated code-stuff is also bad. Obviously the truth must lie somewhere in between. :)</div></div><hr />

Can some one help name this preset (you may think that i'm joking but i'm not, i've kinda hit a naming creative block)<br />

also I think these a bit to cbbc/crap<br />

<div class="posttext">You should definitely learn how to (correctly) make your code framerate independent! Your first preset is so fast, i can't really see what it's supposed to be. It just flashes randomly. The other two presets are also running way too fast on my machine (even though a bit slower).<br />
<br />
So, i'd suggest &quot;UHFROD 1-3&quot; (Ultra High Frequenzy Rotor Of Doom) for their names. :p</div></div><hr />
