<div class="posttext">UUUUUUUNGH! Here ya go :)<br />
<br />
authority - Nice design and that wiggly dm ain't that bad, but the flashing background gets on the nerves after a while. Also the beat detection could be a little better, now it's kinda hard to tell when it reacts to beat...<br />
 <br />
bad influences - Nice superscopes and the background looks cool, though it could stick a bit more out. <br />
<br />
cream dream - Maybe a little too minimalistic on the pattern, but otherwise looks pretty neat-o.<br />
<br />
cubesex - Nice superscopes and the starfield looks great. But the cubes themself don't look 3D since they sometimes get squeezed :igor:<br />
<br />
freedom - Nice simple preset and beat responsive. Though you could fix the &quot;wrap&quot; lines, try example to use a 1x1 grid size in the dm. Works for me.<br />
<br />
go away bastards! - Looks nice, but why the hell you are using a dm with r=-r*3; ? You know you should use a regular movement, because you are not making it dynamic and a movement is more accurate.<br />
<br />
pointless - Nice scope, the background pattern also looks cool. I really love the effect with the convolution filter.<br />
<br />
there still is hope - Another 3D preset, not much to say. The scope reminds me of JDm's &quot;Whitespace&quot;. The starfield doesn't look so good in this one, because there is a big glob of stars in the middle.<br />
<br />
universal fish - Like the idea, pretty beat responsive and the scope is sound responsive. Only thing this could need is that the starfield could be a bit brighter since it's kinda hard to see it.<br />
<br />
wild west - Done, Done &amp; Done before. Still i like this one, because of the simple pattern and it flies nicely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall a good B&amp;W pack. I see lot of improving in here. Keep up the good work :up:<br />
<br />
Oh and your avatar looks like an ugly crack whore :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its the second time someone says that Aragorn aka Phaze`s Avatar looks like a drugged dude...! He rules and would cut your head(and penis) if he would live ! :) Lets return to AVS : thanks for the comments and think i`ll update the pack with COLORS to make it a bit more interesting :) UnConed thank you for the tip i had no idea about a new multiplier.ape . Raz i still am trying to create my own tunnel movement and its 60% done kinda...It morphes around from a tunnel to other forms and i hate it :) Tugg -&gt; the starfield in &quot;there still is hope&quot; is in fact a galaxy ! I wanted the SSC to look like an alien and the scope as a galaxy to show that the alien can reach the galaxy and conquer all planets and life forms ! :) No i aint drunk.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Tugg - i watched JDm`s preset and the scope looks like mine...I just played with pi and tpi as you can see i had no idea about it :) Raz : i want to come to your island ! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hey unconed,<br />
<br />
if your APEs would state what version number they are, it would be a lot easier to make sure on is up-to-date. why not putting a version-number somewhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">anyway, I doubt whether anyone unzipped the ape's. almost everyone has the new version</div></div><hr />
