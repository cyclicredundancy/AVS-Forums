      <p class="post-content">It is ok but it looks better without the bump which makes it turn almost completely white on loud music. It's missing something though. Right now it looks more like a background image that is missing a foreground. Also, is doesnt look too much like ice or a tunnel. Overall i give it a 3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Anibus is right about the white thing. You can take the bump out and use a brightess set to additive blend for a similar effect, but you can tune the brightness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I thought that would be a problem. I took out the bump and put in fast brightness which worked better. About that thing with no foreground image, I'm not sure what to do with that. I'm not very good at SSCs so that doesn't help. To be honest, I didn't think it needed another render object, I thought it would be sort of "kaleidoscopic" if you know what I mean.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It needs something for when there isn't a beat. I know winamp doesn't detect beats very well on some songs, and without a beat your preset is pretty static. It looks decent, but nothing happens. That's a problem for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, Jaheckelsafar is right. That is why it looks like a background. It could be really nice with something else.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But other than that the effect is very nice. The background movement could do with some tweaking, tho. First of all, y=d*r doesn't do anything since you don't have rectangular coordinates turned on, and you aren't using y in the r statement. You could also use a d=d/1.5 to get rid of the ugly line-repetition (doesn't work for windows much wider than 4:3). Also, the DM before that doesn't have to be a DM, since it's static. You could speed it up and get better resolution with a regular movement.<br />
      All in all I don't like the background, I think it could be much better. But this is pretty good for (what I assume to be) a first preset :) Keep it up</p>
