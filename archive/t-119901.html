      <p class="post-content">These range from extremely good to extremely poor...one tip: never use blur at the end of a preset. There are other means of softening the color reigons' borders.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Kalleidoscope : Too fast-changing to "enjoy" - An on-beat capture might help, just apply some transformations to keep it interesting.<br />
      <br />
      Bouncy : The blurs do nothing and the texture is too abrupt. The DM also moves a bit too quickly.<br />
      <br />
      Supersonic : Great work, but I don't think any of the blurs were needed.<br />
      <br />
      Virus : Yuck.<br />
      <br />
      Cult : Quite nice, the beginning movement doesn't exactly do much.<br />
      <br />
      Floor Tiles : It looks very nice, but can use a lot of optimization. Put the mirror outside the effect list but before the DM.<br />
      <br />
      Nightmare : Simplistic but stylish, I like it.<br />
      <br />
      Rain : Neutral about this one. Find another way than using 4 heavy blurs.<br />
      <br />
      Going Down : A replace/replace list is the same as no list as all. Add a fast brite, and to me this is a much better version of Virus, since, it uses the same "rendering scheme" (The low grid-size chaos)<br />
      <br />
      Overall : 3.5 Stars, polishing them would likely to result in 4 stars.</p>
