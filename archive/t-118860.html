<div class="posttext">sorry to say it, but a lot of these just aren't watchable: fusion, psychadelia, pulse, runes, stars and flowers, the center, the endless tunnel, the pulse (any reason you have two of these?), emotions in chalk subdued.  i'd suggest you work on the two vertigo presets as well.  the rest of them are absolutely excellent, tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd chuck the following :<br />
<br />
One of the chalk and one of the vertigo, bad reception, flux, flux2, fusion, pulse, stars and flowers, and the center<br />
<br />
The rest weren't bad. I'd try and make smooth transition in the movement in a couple of them, just to mix things up a bit.<br />
<br />
Person fave was window on my world (though you might want to move that comment out of the effect list).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">here it is improved, but i want to make sure it has only good presets</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">couldn't include APEs becasue of size reasons and I didn't want too many posts.  you need: texer, colormap, convultion, tentacles 3d, and metaballs 3d (i think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th January 2003, 02:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, much improved. You're missing number 15 though. :p<br />
<br />
I think I might leave out techno rings, and superOSC need more. It's pretty plain the way it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good presets.  Here are some tips.<br />
01-Blob- Not a big fan of dot fountain, but good job using it.  A SSC would be a little nicer because of color changing.  Try fixing the second DM.  Manipulation of R has to be done in whole number increments or else you get that horizontal line.<br />
02-Colors- Good preset, but a little repetitive in the movements.  Also, it turns completely grey sometimes.<br />
03-Conveyor Belt-  Doesn't look much like a conveyor belt(white??) and isn't very sophisticated, but good job for your first 3-D DM.<br />
04-Curvy 3D- Makes me think of bending space-time...  Very good job with transition with curves.<br />
05-Emotions in Chalk- What kind of chalk does your sister use?:p Looks a little grainy, but besides that it's a good preset. Moving particle doesn't seem to do much and the blocky partial out can go too.<br />
06-Into the fire- The background doesn't really fit with the foreground.  Both parts are nice though.<br />
07-Kaleidoscope tiling- Somewhat repetitive, but I like the effect.  Make it change a little more and it will be a really good preset.<br />
08-More colors- Kinda boring.  Add a kaleidoscopic effect to it and I think it might turn out well.  Also, colorcode the superscopes, the colors get kinda repetitive.<br />
09-Peyote- Not very fast (16FPS windowed 320x200 on my PIII 1GHz.) but it is music responsive.  The many max blends are causing the colors to interfere with eachother and they also suck framerates.<br />
10-Road- The grass looks weird off in the distance and isn't moving at the same speed as the road.  Also, the road needs to turn some (either that or take out the grass and make it look like montana:) )<br />
11-Seashell- Nice for a 2-D seashell.  Btw, any preset that you use a time variable in uses a custom counter(i.e. t).<br />
12-Techno Rings- Good preset.  It might look better if you make it rotate some more.<br />
13-Televised- Decent cube DM.  Don't really like the fireworks/water combo.  Also, try moving the camera around some.<br />
14-Vertigo- Fix the comment, it says this is Blob.  Good preset though. A little on the repetitive side.<br />
15-&lt;&gt;- This is the worst preset in the pack:) . <br />
16-Window on my world- Don't really like the white square. It sticks out like a sore thumb.  The xor effect is alright though.<br />
17-NoName- The SSC is feeling a bit lonely(he's in a white room) and  sad(he doesn't have a name).  Give him some friends and a name.<br />
18-Bloom- Looks a lot like something I was working on the other day. I like it.<br />
<br />
Overall rating - 4.2. Very good job.  Fix some stuff in it.  Some of the more basic ones could use a complete remix.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for your suggestions.  Remember the last two are only previews, and they will be greatly improved in an upcoming pack.  Thanks for all your help!</div></div><hr />
