      <p class="post-content"><strong>Editing APE's / Render -&gt; Text Source</strong><br />
      Was just wondering if it is possible to edit ape files or if you need the C++ source - i tryed opening it in Visual Studio and just got a bunch of Hex so i'm guessing it's the latter. If so does anyone know where you can get hold of the source for APE's specifically render -&gt; text?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      P.S. Apologies if this is in the wrong forum, but i had a look in the dev one an their wasn't much avs chat, so i thought i'd try here...</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks but That link doesn't seem to work, i'd heard that all the winamp source was available but it just givesme a 404 Not Found - i'm tryin to make a matrix code stlye effect like the screensavers et all with the song lyrics incorperated, tho i'm tryin to start with the song title - but you can't change the text in the render effect dynamically, tho u can use register values, so i was gonna modify the render effect to cast numerical register values into characters n change the text orientation so its goin down the screen. The other way i was thinking of doin it was using Grandchilds Text Superscope,tho i can't use other fonts etc with this method, but both of these ways have substantial foreseeable problems, i'm sure there is an easier way - any ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">you dont need to modify the avs source to produce that effect (unless you want lyrics), and besides, part of the fun of AVS is trying to achieve fancy effects without needing to hack it out in a lower level language.<br />
      <br />
      Depending on the exact effect you want you can approach it in a few different ways. To get an alphabet that you can manipulate you can either use a ssc and draw the glyphs manually or use a render/text to output the song title and mask it appropriately. You can use a movement or dynamic movement to shift the text and make the letters move.<br />
      <br />
      Just keep experimenting.<br />
      <br />
      (hint: other people have made matrix style falling-letter presets, try looking for them)</p>

      <p class="post-content">[back on topic] Cheers PAK-9, i did kinda realise that it could be done in AVS, but i just thought it might be easier to modify the Text renderer to display vertical instead of horizontal text lines, and was also considering trying to get Render-&gt;Text to take the text to display from a variable, because i'm trying to display the lyrics I thought that'd be easiest. Anyway i've got the random letterfall working, just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get the lyrics for a song? I only found 1 lyrics plugin which worked with avs(lyricsShow), but only up until v3, anyone know why ? (tryed contacting the author but no reply), the other method i was considering was using the other lyrics plugins that display data in another window, but i don't have a clue how to go about accessing that - any clues?</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are basically two steps you would need:<br />
      <br />
      1. Find the Window<br />
      2. Retrieve the text<br />
      <br />
      To find the window you would need to call something like EnumWindows to get a list of window handles, which you could then use to interrogate all windows and find out which one is the lyrics plugin. How you interrogate them depends on the plugin, as a simple example you could call GetWindowText and look for the plugin name.<br />
      <br />
      To get the text inside the plugin depends on how the plugin presents the lyrics. If it has a text box with them in you can send a WM_GETTEXT message to retreive it, if the lyrics are presented in a more sophisticated custom control you might have more trouble.</p>
