      I just thought of a new game where somebody names a preset and the next person has to say who made it and then somebody picks a new preset and so on.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't like. Plus I would ruin it pretty quickly by stating some preset nobody has ever heard of that I made.:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with Raz, leave it to the GD forums. Post pumping in the AVS forums is kind of an art form ;) You have to know when &amp; where and get away from it :D Reviewing presets for example is pretty easy, it's useful, it helps and it never stops since there is always going to be new presets to be reviewed :)</p>
