      <p class="post-content"><strong>I Hate This Pack!</strong><br />
      It got <b>4 out of 5</b> for ratings and I thought it was a good pack so I loaded it up then it's so.. <b>crap</b>! Obviously, it just got <b>3.5 out 5</b> rated by staff review. Instead, it was rated by it's own author! I'll not loads a pack without viewing the details first. This pack must be <b>RIP</b>!!! :tinfoil: Worthless pack.. sucks..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Here's the pack:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Seems like he boosted his own ratings, that's a bit of a bad sportmanship, but what can you do? Well you could report the abuse of the rating system and had a higher authority to take care of it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, actually most people will at least glance at the comments and not only dl something by the number of stars alone (or am i really that naive?) And from the comments i find it quite obvious that it's not worth five stars.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You pervert! It's true. This pack is indeed ass. I think it might be a concept pack that the author decided to post on the site, which is usually not a good idea. I made schmidtloads of these presetes back in the day, when I was just screwing around with the effects and everything. I remember. The first preset that I cracked open for exploration was Pina Colada by Tugg himself. I messed with it for ten minutes and actually discovered things, like how to change the colors. We all have literally hundreds of these proof of concept presets lying around somewhere. I think that this might indeed be a set of them.<br />
      <br />
      As far as giving himself a 5 rating, that's just bad sportmanship. One does no rate one's own packs.<br />

      I expect him to come down soon. Ready the auto-n00b-response-cannon!!!</p>
