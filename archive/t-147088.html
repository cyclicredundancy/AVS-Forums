<div class="posttext">I didn't know if you guys had seen this already, but on DeviantArt there's an Simple-As-Possible AVS contest. Full article here  (http://news.deviantart.com/article/10711/). It's quite refreshing to make something without dynmovs or sscs once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sounds great. I hope someone who doesn't do all thos whacky 3D raytraced dm's, ssc's and stuff doesn't win.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It wouldn't be s-a-p if somebody like that would, right? I'm wondering where the judges at devart put their lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The article says:<br />
<br />
No dynamic movements, distance modifiers, or shifts.<br />
No superscopes.<br />
<br />
That are the only rules. But you can still use the bump, which can be programmed to for example use for an alphablending-like effect (which I'm using to put that dynamic touch in my presets ;) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th August 2003, 11:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes yes, i know they can't use the heavy effects, but they still can enter and make simple stuff :) I just thought it would be &quot;wrong&quot; for someone advanced to win :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ishan, there is a difference between noob presets and old school.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've been trying all afternoon, but all I get has been done, done and overdone before. The idea was tempting, I admit, but it just not realizable. Let's face it; we cant live without SSC's and DM's ;'(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th August 2003, 22:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">old school has still dynamic distance modifier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">horse-fly</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 07:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">actually, most old presets i remember of rarely even used the ddm.  most were based on some type of movement for some effect, but superscopes were common... nuts.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
rattaplan:  this is how spoiled you newbs are, and i can say that as i have been working with avs since people were amazed by the implementation of the dymanic shift.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree with horse-fly, You new folk are too spoiled :p Tho even i don't understand the forbidding of superscopes... i have avsed for 4 years now and i have always been able to use superscopes... well maybe it's better, because i doubt anyone would settle for &quot;only simple superscopes&quot; :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is my entry to the contest. I think it's an ok sample that you can indeed do cool stuff even without the megaeffects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 11:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Horse-Fly, mind who you're talking to! Who are you calling a newb? i've been AVS'ing for well over 3 years now... I know very well what i'm talking about. It's just that i didn't have an internet connection bavk in those days. I've been using 3.5&quot; disks to share presets with my friends... Aah.. the old days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">horse-fly</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 19:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">the idea is nowadays, that most people use superscopes and dm's, not even realizing that there are other effects in the library.  Of course those are most customizable, but you can some times get the same effect when using some of those &quot;noobish&quot; or as i call them old school effects.  <br />
<br />
The only reason i called you a newb (i didn't know that you worked with avs for  3 years now) is that you (among other people) have become too dependent on superscopes and dynamic movements.  Most of the forum entries here are based on the science of avs, just to become more technically pleasing, when the art of avs is lost.<br />
<br />
So as you have been working with avs for three years, you should well know how to make presets without the need for most of those dynamic trans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th August 2003, 20:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I do, but static presets have been around for so long, almost everything has been done before. This makes it extremely difficult to come up with something that's never been seen before.<br />
<br />
That's what I meant with not being able to live without dynamics. I mean, look at today's presets and at the oldschool presets. the older ones are very repetative compared to what we're doing today. Especially the use of timers gives you so much more freedom.<br />
<br />
And yeah, we still have the DDM... And Horse-Fly, you know what? you're right. I haven't been using that one almost ever since the DM, although I do use other effects, but I have a *LOT* of unpublished work that uses them, but that isn't worth publishing. But thing is, that i'm currently working on finding out how to handle complexer 3D SSC's myself.. Yeah, I know, d/l 3 random packs and i should be able to know everything I need to know, but the sport is to find things out myself in advanve instead of ripping someone elses code apart afterward... That's what keeps me AVS'sing, breaking my brain over having the code written out in my mind... hmmmm...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I returned from my vacation just in time for a contest :)<br />
And I remember a time when there was no warp or bylinear filtering but there were still cool presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I actually managed to make a couple of decent presets with no DMs and SSCs... I still managed to fill one of them with a shit ton of code and a raytraced torus though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i made one too, but as tugg pointed out, it's not 'right' that we use apes in the entries, although they're not denied. i think i've been depending lately on some apes, but i guess that's the only chance left knowing that nullsoft won't update avs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th September 2003, 07:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, but zamuz you have no need to take my words seriously, im just a fanatic about &quot;0ldsk00l avs&quot; and probably the only one in this contest... Use your damn monkeys, but don't be suprised if i bitch about it :p</div></div><hr />

Honestly, this contest started with the best of intentions but people kinda lost focus of SIMPLE aspect of it.  It was great to see El-vis' stuff, very old school.</div></div><hr />
