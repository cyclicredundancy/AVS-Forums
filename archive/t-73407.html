      Is there a way to have visualizations randomly change with each new song?</p>

      Ok, maby i did not understand what you ment but if you double-click the visulization window a window will apear, ok we all know that.<br />
      And under the Settings menu click Presets/Hotkeys, then other options will apear. At the bottom of the window there is now acheck-box "Randomly switch presets", below you can type the number of second the preset changes, and above there is a button that selects the directory from witch to select the presets, it's setted to "All" by default.</p>

      </blockquote>the problem is the random thing switches the presets every x seconds, and he wanted it to switch at the songs end and that doesn't work
