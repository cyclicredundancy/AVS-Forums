<div class="posttext">Here's some stuff I made using gmegabuf.<br />
<br />
Mystify: screensaver-like preset using particles that bounce around and are connected by lines.<br />
<br />
Particles: Exactly what the name implies. This one uses loop() commands, so the max particle size is about 400. Click to add &quot;energy&quot;. This engine isn't perfect, since particles sometimes get stuck in the floor. But it shows what you can do with gmegabuf.<br />
<br />
Screenfade: The red is a spectrum visualization. The blue is a ghost image of the red, saved using gmegabuf.<br />
<br />
Waterfall: A particle engine made to look like a waterfall (sort of). Change the number in the SC to whatever you want; this one does not use the loop function so there is no limit. Just don't expect it to run fast at high numbers.<br />
<br />
The gmegabuf function is great! I just wish the loop function's count could reach the limit of gmegabuf. That's what is really needed right now to make full use of gmegabuf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can just do nested loops if you need more. The limit is there to prevent infinite loops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't see why that limit should be there.  I also don't see why we should have a &quot;countdown&quot; type loop rather than an argument based loop (e.g. for( ; ; )).  There ought to be an addition to the Main tree which sets a personal limit for loop repetitions...that would both eliminate infinite loops and give us more flexibility with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The difference between the current loop and for( ; ; ) is purely semantical. The for-syntax only adds something in powerful languages like C++ where you can use iterators or objects rather than ints. <br />
<br />
I'm getting tired of your whining about the new AVS stuff: it's not as if it's an amazingly low-level function in an otherwise high-level language. AVS Evallib is low-level all the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Now with collision detection! (But not accurate collisions; the balls don't bounce off realistically.)<br />
<br />
A nicer syntax would have made it easier to write the code, but this proves (to me at least) that AVS is capable of some complicated effects, even if they are a bitch to program.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you need to predict collisions based on the next frame, based on the direction the particles are moving. That way, they wont stick together like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd December 2003, 12:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, I know, I might make true collisions later on. I just wanted to see if I could get any detection at all using loop() and gmegabuf().</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i started, but it got too messy so i gave up.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, there's a useful tricks for using loops:<br />
<br />
loop(n,<br />
 assign(blah,blah)+<br />
 assign(blah,blah)+<br />
 assign(blah,blah)+<br />
 assign(blah,blah)<br />
);<br />
<br />
Much easier than trying to leep track of a whole bunch of exec3's</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that collision one is nice :). I don't understand it, but it looks really nice. you could make a great preset out of it.</div></div><hr />
