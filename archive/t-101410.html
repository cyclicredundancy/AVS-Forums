      Most of you guys seem to have a mind-boggling grip on math and programming. I just wanted to know, how do I get started and how long did it take you guys to learn all this?<br />
      <br />
      I have been trying to get superscopes down for almost a year now, and I can barely make a decent Movement, much less a dynamic movement. All the tutorials I have seen have either been REALLY technical or just poorly worded and impossible for a guy like me to understand.<br />
      <br />
      I am in college, and I am a very bright person, but I think this stuff is just over my head. Any pointers?:igor:<br />
      <br />
      Lastly, I have attached EVERY SINGLE AVS I have ever made or edited greatly from another idea. (Since it won't let me upload my SFX file, unzip it to C:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs\) If you have any questions or comments, email me. <a href="mailto:BryanCDonaldson@aol.com">BryanCDonaldson@aol.com</a><br />

      Thanks!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Another perfect test subject for AVS Primer, unless you've already seen it, in which I'm deeply disappointed in myself :(<br />

      Otherwise go to <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com/gallery" target="_blank">http://atero.deviantart.com/gallery</a> , there should be a link there for it.<br />
