      <p class="post-content">yeah i noticed that. apparently my installer was majorly fucked up to begin with and i was looking at the wrong crap. fixed but about as useful as that zip is in the first place so i won't screw with it anymore :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">phaze you're an asshole. use a fucking nsis installer. zips suck.<br />
      <br />
      but thank you :D<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      i'd appreciate it if you guys could come up with specific things for me to find and fix instead of just "spelling in the txts" - yea i know i made typoes but i'm more worried about getting the installer fixed than trying to go through everything myself and fix it. it'd be great if you could help me out in that respect :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You say that rand(x) outputs a random number between 0 and x. I think its meant to be 0 and x-1. Eg, rand(2) is either 0 or 1.<br />
      <br />
      And i know youv probably had enough by now, but it would be nice if you could do an explanation of the arc functions, as well as the sigmoid function.<br />

      I havnt actually read much of it yet, but it seems pretty damn good to me.</p>

      :up: thank you!<br />
      <br />
      will you publish the next version with *.htm files with the option to choose different languages?<br />
      <br />
      I have done a german translation from the old primer version before but never completed and published it and my fu**ing 30 GB Maxtor crashed last moth (loose a very important folder with 1/2 of my backups :( )<br />
      So who will help me to translate the newer primer version(s)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">1) it says (i believe, but i'm too lazy to check right now...just got up) in the readme that i'm gonna be porting the txts to html<br />
      2) i also said that i'm gonna be doing a new version of the coding tut with updated information on all the functions (once again, too lazy to check, but it should be there)<br />
      3) i don't know french, german, japanese, spanish, finnish, korean, russian, portugese, swedish, dutch, and klingon, so you're just going to have to deal with english for the time being ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm... Finnish translation you say? :p<br />
      <br />
      Shouldn't be a problem otherwise than explaining those math functions... But would i do it? hmm... that's something to think about... i wish JDm would still be interested in AVS, because he could do it with no sweat! I don't know could i do it so well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">3dino: no i don't want you publishing it here and i haven't checked my email in a bit cos hotmail is being a bizzatch. thank you for being so enthusiastic but i'd really rather wait on doing language packs until the final version is out, and i will be doing the html myself. but when the final version does come out i'd appreciate you doing a translation then :)<br />
