<div class="posttext">As far as I know, those components are picked by something like rating/views/downloads. I don't know for sure, but I think it is one of those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Look, shabavis - you have gone and made more threads in the last couple days than we normally get in an entire month - chill a little - you are creating a thread everytime you need something even when you don't need to.  For example, all of your threads about the components section of winamp having problems can be answered by the fact that the databases are screwy - no need to ask anymore of those questions.<br />
<br />
You do not have any packs out of yet that are good enough to get into the featured components section - you may later on, but not as of now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next time you have a question about anything to do with the submitted plugins or bugs in databases, or the like - just PM an AVS reviewer.  I will be glad to answer any questions that you have - but when you create a thread every time you think of something, people get mad.  Just PM me next time - if I can't help you then I can tell you who can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this is that, if your pack is in the eyecandies, all ppl who have had more review points that you would like to be in there...<br />
this is pointless request, this will never come true, sorry :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shabaviz55</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2003, 13:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you very much anubis. other people must learn polite from you.<br />
I mean Tuggummi &amp;....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2003, 14:25</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Yeah, im not a friendly kind of a guy, im not perfect, but neither are you since you're posting this kind of senseless stuff. Atleast the reason why i don't like posting a big fat reply to something like this is because i can't really say if the person is even listening. A lot of people just post here once a pointless post and then never come again... writing a huge post about why something like this is considered lame &amp; annoying seems pointless when there is no certain promise my message will get even trough to you :/<br />
<br />
But here is some reasons why these posts aren't exactly considered as 'good' posts.<br />
<br />
1) Whining about how some components description or download links get screwed up is no use, because nobody here can really do anything about it here. And basicly if you spot something wrong, you should PM a moderator/reviewer i.e. Rovastar/Anubis2003 atleast they can inform furthermore about the problem, if they can't correct it themselves.<br />
<br />
2) Asking about being featured for a one week is like asking 'let me win the lotto just once! I promise i'll be happy about it!' Well unlike in lotto, here you have to earn a featuring by doing good stuff, as simple as that.<br />
<br />
3) Posting a whole thread and asking why this&amp;that member doesn't surf the forums is quite lame when you could just PM the person himself and ask why.<br />
<br />
4) Asking why someones work suddenly has a lower rating is really really pointless. The rating system there isn't for nothing! Besides the reviewer who gives it a base score the public rates&amp;comments the component and the public really is a X factor you can never figure out what it does.<br />
<br />
5) Inquiring about peoples personal lives is always considered a kind of 'offense' some people might be offended by it, inquiring it publicly is considered as an attack. And this is the AVS forums, we are here to talk about AVS and other related stuff, not about our personal lives! If someone wants to talk about 'how they madly fell in love with this person' they go to the GD forum and stay there.<br />
<br />
6) I refer to your '102&amp;5 Hit Channel:show Avs Presets !!!' thread. Posting something that has no description whatsoever and only some random text is really indeed a big wtf!? You except us to read your mind?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, learn to use some common sense. Please?</div></div><hr />
