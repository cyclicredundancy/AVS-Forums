      <p class="post-content"><strong>Dynamic Shift...</strong><br />
      I need some help with my dynamic shift code.. I'm <b>TOTALLY</b> new to scripting in AVS, so please excuse me for the ever-so-simple code... as you can see in my preset, on a beat, it randomly makes the "fire" go to the left or right, like a breeze is coming by. Well, it actually works pretty good, but if it chooses to go to the right or left too much, the visual is bad, and is hard for it to choose the right number to go back the other way.i want it to be able that when it is at a certain point, to go the other way, by forcing it to use the positive or negative numbers, to go the other way until it reaches another point, then it goes all regular again. This might not make much sence now, but just dl it and see for yourself. Might take a bit, but it does happen... Any Help?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Because you're incrementing ex every beat, you can get a situation where ex=ex+2 every beat, or ex=ex-2 every beat. Instead, use ex=rand(n)-n/2 (which gives you numbers from n-n/2=n/2 to 0-n/2=-n/2. And x=2.1 is pointless since you redefine it later.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow, thanks!<br />
      <br />
      I always thought i was missing something simple... :p<br />
      <br />
      Edit: yeah, 2.1 is kinda pointless, but when there is no beat, doesnt it give it a breeze, as if there was a beat?? ... ... ... ... ... ... Dang, I hate thinking.. &lt;buzzing coming from head&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Because ex doesn't ever change when there's no beat. When you say x=..., x is wiped out and replaced with .... So you're wiping out that 2.1 and replacing it with ex.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you wanna do something only on the beat, you gotta do in the beat section. You could make it gust on a beat, then have it gradually go back to the original breeze.</p>
