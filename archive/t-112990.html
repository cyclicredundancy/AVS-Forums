      Yes: quality does take time. But I don't think 2 months is not enough time for a quality pack, unless there's like 30+ presets in the pack.</p>

    How the f**k would you know how long a quality AVS pack takes to make? Your presets are nowhere near the sort of thing that UnConeD makes. Then theres the fact that not everyone has to sit at there computers during every minute that god gives them so that they can churn out a quality pack at high speed.<br />
    <br />
    The other thing that really p*sses me off is your attitude. You are so unwilling to use your brain. Does it hurt to think every now and again?<br />

          <br />
          Here's a recommendation for you Xion. Learn to make your own AVS presets which can try to rival UnConeD's in quality and appearance, then you can make your own quality pack in 2 months... and don't you dare start whinging about how little you know about DM's and SSC's, you won't know anything until you learn it, there are a sh*t ton of FAQs, basic tutorials, code examples and presets out there that you can use, combined with your own ability to learn, to start making some quality presets.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          In summation, make sure you know what you are talking about before you open your mouth (or start typing) and don't be so damned ignorant.

      Yes, I don't know how long quality takes, but I do know that coding APE's are long. I forgot about the new APE's that ConeD is putting into the pack. My mistake, and can I get a padlock?

      <p class="post-content">Btw I'm not doing any AVSing this week. This message is being written from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Nice city, except for all the pro-US propaganda that they shove down your throat at the independence hall.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and airport security is bitchy here. One of the three people who was travelling with us here was almost denied access to the US because they said she returned her green card 1 year too late the last time she was here (yet she returned it on time, and she wasn't in the US to return it a year after she left anyhow). Obviously the card was lost and returned too late: yet obviously it was *her* fault. There's something here about the people in uniforms (police, immigration, rangers) that makes them talk to you in this annoying teacher-like voice as if you are a kid. I bet I've had higher education than that jerk even though I haven't even finished my college. When he asked what 'city in Brussels' we left in, I had to surpress my laughter.<br />
      And getting my bag searched twice and getting a personal metal scan (incl. removing shoes) was exactly my idea of a relaxing vacation. In short: took us one hour to go from the airplane's door to the airport's exit.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and the US drinking policy sucks maaajorly too. I've been drinking beer for ages now, yet here I'm supposed to wait another three years before I can even *enter* a pub? :)<br />
      <br />
      Basically the US is a nice, but weird place. Cola costs less than mineral water, and a hamburger costs less than a roll. I finally understand why people tend to be fatter here, considering the amazingly bad eating habits I see around here. People are friendly and very thankful (one guy was amazed that I moved a chair in the McD out of the way because he had to pass with a trolley), but on the other hand they seem to be impatient as well: like the one lady who was honking and shouting for the traffic in front of here to move on 'for f*ck's sake' even though the light was red. Traffic rules are followed loosely here as well: apparently a fat white line at a traffic light indicated the area where you're supposed to stop with a radius of about 3 meters. Cars are gas-guzzling and quite large. I don't see the use of a large 4x4 SUV in a city where the speed limit is 30mph with virtally no hills.<br />
      The university of pennsylvania, and wharton school in particular is amazing: students have access to high-tech study rooms where they can have private conferences with electronic drawing boards and such. I guess the high tuition costs are getting spent well. The buildings around here aren't bad, though there is an unusually high amount of churches around here. Now I understand why all the bank notes say "In god we trust", even though the US claims to have complete separation of church and state.<br />
      US money has to be the most irritating to use by the way: all the notes are the same colour and size, and the notes are huge too.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I'm off again :). I'm having a great time with my friends and being on holiday has been a while for me. I forgot all the little fun details like being able to carry on loud conversations about the guy next to you because he doesn't understand you anyway :D.</p>
