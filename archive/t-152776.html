		I like the var expansion ;)<br />
<br />
There'll be a better version, but it'll involve a complete rewrite of the (EXTREMELY LENGTHY) frame section, and I'm too tired of this atm to do that :P There's also a small bug somewhere in the frame section that I can't identify, but it's very minor...all it does is tilt the web slightly (when it is at rest).  But...take one fucking look at the frame section....  At one point, someone told me something about a needle and a haystack, but I can't remember exactly what it was right now...;) :|<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes, it is all one superscope...isn't that amayzing and majickle... :D

		Very responsive. Maybe you could make it 3d, if that doesn't take too much code.

One way to find that bug alot easier would be to cut the code and paste it into MSword or notepad or something, that way it's all displayed in front of you, instead of having to sift through all that stuff for hours trying to find a few little incorrect numbers, a needle in a haystack, like you said.  Then when you have it 'bug-free', you can paste it back in the frame box.<br />
<br />
That's only just a little over 2 pages of code to look through :p

		skupers, yea, it'd take way too much code :P the number of vars i'd need for a cube with n points to an edge would be 2n^3+1 (not including the 8 built in ssc vars), and it gets bigger when i try to do the &quot;improved&quot; version (something like 24n^3-3n^2+1).  that and the perpoint section would be fucking enourmous, and i don't even want to think about how many points i'd need to draw it correctly.  even to make the plane 3d would be a project i'm not willing to take on atm :|<br />
this is one of the reasons i don't think that 356 vars is enough - if i'm going to do an immense code construct like this then i'd like to be able to make it bigger.  i'm pretty sure that as it is, my improved version will only be able to get a max 9 points to a side, counting in some major variable compression, and it'd be hella slow...what we REALLY REALLY REALLY need is some array support.  it'd make life so much easier :\

		wow - that is awesome.  And, although a 3D one would be amazingly kickass, I definitely understand not wanting to spend time on making it - it would take forever, and with the variable limit we have would not be able to look that good either.<br />
<br />
A sphere with this kind of web would be awesome too.  Oh well

		You should generate code like this using a script language like PHP. Or even mIRC script ;).<br />
Much faster.<br />
<br />
I assume this is a giant mass/spring system as used in cloth simulations?

		well I'M TOO STUPID TO WRITE A SCRIPT MMK :p<br />
and yea, just a spring system, every point is attracted logarithmically to the points it is connected to (minus the corners)...

		WOW! I can only imagine how long that took to type out, nice job. If only I had the patience to do something like that, I get bored dealing with things like that after something like 10 points.

		Yeah, the scopes are amazing, but im afraid you will use your XOR-tricks for the final preset :igor: :p

I was actually thinking about having the web, as you have it now, not only move along x and y axis, but also along z. The per-point section doesn't have to be much larger then, because you also need one extra line for the z-co√∂rdinates.

		I wish this AVS had color. It was amazing that this preset had color.<br />
WOW!!! All of this code is for spiderweb!!!<br />
<br />
Run with (2.7pre3)

		Ok, is this a problem with me, or is everyone just exaggerting. I mean, I can see the code, but I cant see what it does exactly. The preset, after loading, starts (of course). Then the ssc jumps up and what I can see is this:<br />
<pre><code><br />
-----------------        <br />
        /\<br />
       /  \<br />
      /    \<br />
     /      \<br />
    /        \<br />
</code></pre><br />
This is all I can see. the lines move with music, thats all.

		if he didn't it'd fuck winamp over...dunno what your problem is shreyas<br />
<br />
shabavis, it's an unfinished preset...VERY unfinished....<br />
<br />
and skupers, yeah i thought of that too, but with what i've got planned it'd be (unfortunately) quite limiting size-wise.  ho hum :\
