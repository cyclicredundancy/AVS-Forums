		'Kay, I've worked on my cube a bit, trying to cut it down and make it more versatile, but it still seems pretty ugly and unintuitive :igor: (trying to make it as simple to edit as possible, just 'cause).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be apreciated.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have.

		Ehg... I don't do 3d scopes... I think it looks ok for a base, but if you really think it's that bad, you could try messing with the red blue and green variables. Maybe the color could change on the radius? Or perhaps you could make more rings that shrink as they get further from the center, sort of sphere-like. Well, that's what I think, but I wouldn't trust me.
