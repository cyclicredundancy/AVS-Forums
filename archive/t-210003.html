		i can't allow it. Since we both decided not to stop our disputes, i had to vote no.<br />
<br />
Although i think that he would do a good job. And also i don't fear that he could abuse that new &quot;power&quot; then in any way.<br />
<br />
ah, what the heck... if there really is a new mod needed then pak should do it!

		While I would be glad seeing Pak-9 as a mod, I doubt we need any more. And unless you convince an admin to do it (and I doubt that many are watching/care about this board, this thread doesn't achieve anything.

		why in the first place?<br />
<br />
When there is/was any need of modding in this silent section of the forums, UCD has been able to handle it so far...<br />

I see no need for another one, so I vote no.

I do pop in from time to time but there really is not much need to mod anything. Obviously Steve does a far to good a job. Although I have no idea what Rocker has even doen in the AVS forums. That's those aussie crims for you.

Well not as much as being newb, but some (most?) of AVS regulars don't visit any other section of the massive winamp forums so someone might not know that just because they've never ran into him even though they've been 'around' for a long time.<br />
<br />
But anyway...
