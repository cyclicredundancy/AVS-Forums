      <p class="post-content"><strong>LOTR fans!</strong><br />
      This is for all you Lord of the Rings fans out there: it's not perfect yet, but it is kind of cool IMO. I've been tinkering around with several things trying to make a preset to resemble Sauron's eye. Some of them are obviously messed up, but I decided to include all of them. Tell me which you like best<br />
      <br />
      I have a question for people like UnConeD: The Eye in the LOTR movie appears to be more like a "cat's eye." Could you give me some help in giving it the weird-looking thing in the center of a cat's eye? Feedback especially appreciated from those who have seen the Fellowship of the Ring.<br />
      <br />
      All feedback is welcome positive or negative (please keep it related to AVS, though).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, I think my favourite out of the bunch was almost perfected 2.2, it is most like I remember the eye. I still think it needs work though. The problem is that it doesn't look like there's enough going on. I don't know what you add that wouldn't make it look over crowded.<br />

      yes-that's my favorite. I still don't know how to make that cat's eye effect in the center of the eye. Maybe UnConeD can help. Thanks for the input.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Try a superscope to obscure it, like this:<br />
      <br />
      frame: sd=1<br />
      point:<br />

      y=u*.9;<br />
      x=cos(u*1.565)*sd*.2<br />

      You'll probably want to use a low amount of points combined with a higher line width. The 1.565 should be pi, but to prevent weird line drawing caused by rounding off errors, I used a lower value.</p>

      UnConeD-thanks a lot! :) Your instructions really helped. Now I'll post a 2nd version just to make sure I did it right. I decided to leave the inside of the eye slightly fiery-so that's why I have so many different superscopes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Woah! I think you may have overdone the points on the superscopes. 1800? I took a zero off the end of all of the 1800 point ones and didn't notice a difference except for a jump for 8 or 9 fps.<br />

      Surely there's more Lord of the Rings fans out there, right? I've gotten good help on fixing up my preset from UnConeD, but I need some more suggestions on what to change.<br />
      <br />
      If you're a LOTR fan, even if you know very little about AVS, please comment on my preset. Criticism, suggestions; they're all welcome! Just say whatever you think about the preset and we'll work on it.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>how did you open it?</strong><br />
      First, a little background information about how you opened it always helps :)<br />
      <br />
      But I'll put a few possible suggestions. Because certain programs can override Window's built-in decompressor program's settings (or several other possible reasons), if your computer it doesn't recognize the .zip file after you download it, try downloading a copy of winzip at <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">www.winzip.com</a><br />
      <br />
      If you are using winzip, make sure you either set the destination to the AVS directory, which is usually located at c:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\Avs\. Or if you're unzipping to the default Winzip directory, you can copy the preset into the Winamp AVS directory.<br />
      <br />
      If the preset unzips fine to the AVS directory, then I'll probably need to know everything you did and anything the computer prompts you to do. Then we'll work from there.<br />

      Nice work. I'm digging 'The eye fire.2'. Very sinister, very much on fire, very Sauron.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, here's an idea to kick around for another LOTR-type preset: How about something based on Frodo's sword, Sting? Maybe not using the sword itself, but with the feel of the weapon in mind...sharp, shiny, and glowing blue when the orcs show up...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I'm still here</strong><br />
      Just wanted to let you know I'm still here and have been checking this thread as often as I can-and I've seen the two new posts-I've just been busy thinking.<br />
      <br />
      ...Thinking about "things that were...things that are...and some things that have not yet come to pass"<br />
      :)<br />
      I've (actually) been trying to figure out how to make something like Frodo's sword Sting. (this is in respones to soulcatalyst's reply in this thread with the subject "sting). I've been thinking about a rotating superscope in the shape of a pointy object, preferably a sword. If possible, I'd like to use the RGB features in superscope to make it cycle through some "dull" color and a blue (symbolic of when the sword turns blue as orcs are near)<br />
      Or possibly have a DM distort it or something like that. I'm still not sure what approach would be best.<br />
      <br />
      It may be too early for me to ask a good question for the smart people in the forum, but I just wanted to get my ideas down in writing before I forgot them :D.<br />
      <br />
      uNDefineD: Nice work on the ring. I liked how fiery it looked.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Here's some modified presets of Sauron's Eye. Some of the modifications are hardly noticable, but I think one actually seriously improved the effect. These are just some of the ones I liked the best (even though Eye almost perfected 2.2 fire.2 didn't have the cat's eye)<br />
      <br />
      What do you think about the idea of LOTR themed presets? Originality &amp; stuff like that?<br />
      <br />
      I appreciate any reviews, preset topic suggestions, criticism, remixes, or any other form of input.<br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      Secondly: I don't want somebody to exactly tell me what to do for this (I'd like to more or less come up with it), but I just need a few **hints** as to what sort of superscope/movement (or DM) combinations might accomplish the suggestion for Frodo's Sword sting and / or my idea for either Barad Dur or Mount Doom?<br />
      <br />
      Again: I don't want exact instructions, I'd much prefer some hints that will get me started. I just have no clue what type of stuff I'm trying to make, so any input is welcome and appreciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You'd have a hard time making anything as complicated as a sword in a DM. Your best bet for a sword would probably a wireframe with a superscope. That gives a decent framerate (depending on how complicated your model is), and you can do a nifty glow/tracer thing. (see attached file)<br />
      <br />
      It would also be easiest with multiple scopes.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      As for the theme, I dunno how many presets based on lord of the rings you'll be able to make with the limitations of AVS. Good luck.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>messed up sting</strong><br />
      I changed your anyshape thing a little bit, but it morphs when I don't want it to. It'd be cool if I could add a handle at the bottom if I could get it to stop morphing what side the end to hold is. (basically-freeze it at an angle that makes it appear that the sword has a handle on the bottom instead of a randomly changing handle-you'll see when you download it.<br />
      <br />
      I'm eager to see any remixes you guys might come up with. Or new ideas on how to make a better-looking sting than my remix.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>reason</strong><br />
      Yeah, the first one was a mess-up, but my newest one is much better.<br />
      In my newest one, however, the most n for init is 800 for my border around the eye. The multiple ones were originally to create a semi-opaque darker area that wouldn't bleed into the main fire part &amp; "put the fire out." This allowed for the maximum fire while still having a little bit fancier cat's eye than I originally intended.<br />
      <br />
      --edit: The preset is Sauron's Fiery eye.3--<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: Perhaps you can give me some advice on the sword. It morphs when I don't want it to (see previous reply of mine). Maybe :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, it's my scope, dammit. I can help too. You don't always have to go running to UnConeD. Now I'm offended. :) :)<br />
      <br />
      Changing rcbs to 0 will stop the morphing. It's caused by the chaging radius of the points on the shape. (I thought the comment would be clear enough for customization) For the handle, just toss on another superscope. Shift the x1,y1,z1 values before the rotation (the sin/cos statements) to place it where you want.<br />
      <br />
      Looks nice so far. :up:</p>

      I forgot about the comment! I remember now looking at it once, but I guess I forgot it was there. Yeah-it was clear. I assume I'd change the second scope to be the shape I wanted for the handle, and then change the position to where I want, right?</p>

      The only variables you need to know, are the (lx,ly,lz) ones, these define the light position, and the higher the n, the better the look, the slower it runs...<br />
      <br />
      And in case you were wondering, what the superscope does is calculate 3 points of a torus at once, and rotates them in 3D, then calculate the normals of the 3 points (making a face) by calculating the cross product, then takes a normalized value, and subtracts the point's position by the light value, then normalizes that, then uses the dot product of both normalized vectors to calculate the light intensity.<br />
      <br />
      And if you have found a way of making it better, please let me know :) (Although not many people may even know what a normal is...)

      Also, the math-luvvin' out there will realise there's no need to normalize the face normal, as it's generated based on a unit sphere.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Gradient</strong><br />
      I'm not sure what you meant with the unit-sphere, but wouldn't it be easier to calculate the normal in a point as the gradient of the torus' equation?<br />
      <br />
      For a torus with radii c (from center to the tube's center) and a (radius of the tube) the equation is:<br />
      <br />
      sqr(c - sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y))) + sqr(z) = sqr(a)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      So the gradient's components are:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://acko.net/dump/torusgrad.png" target="_blank">http://acko.net/dump/torusgrad.png</a><br />
      <br />
      By calculating the 3 components and normalizing the resulting vector, you get the normal on the function's isosurface through that point (which is of course your torus).<br />
      <br />
      As you can see, the x and y components are nearly the same, so you can optimize them easily.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and if you calculate the sines and cosines of your rotation matrix only once instead of each frame, it'll speed up more.</p>

      Yes, that's what I meant. You can stretch it by mulyiplying x1,y1,z1 to give it more of a crossguard look.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Unconed, the unit sphere method is faster because it just uses the fact that the face normal at any point on a sphere is the negative of the vector of the point. So basically, I'm using a sphere's normals and using them for the torus. It looks good, and runs good. I also used that hint about the pre-defined sin and cos, thanks for that.</p>

      I'm currently using a demo of Bryce, so one of the pictures will have the demo MetaTools background embedded in it.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe some of you smart people could make a DM to zoom in on Barad Dur then rise up to the top (like in the movie one of the times when Frodo puts the ring on &amp; he sees Barad Dur in the distance...then it keeps getting closer &amp; closer. When it seems that he's reached it, the image moves up to the top of the tower where he sees the eye-you know...that scene I just described). That *would* be extremely cool<br />

      If I had a full version of Bryce5, I'm sure they would be much better.</p>

      This is great coding work for the ring, guys! Thanks a lot...I just wish I could do stuff like that so I could put it in one of my upcoming packs. Jaheckelsafar: The handle of the sword is really stumping me. And the sword is still a little messed up. I'm trying to get it to look just a little more like a sword (handle shape, etc.) but am still having problems figuring out what to do.<br />
      <br />
      Please help! Also, maybe some of you people who are good with coding can come up with a DM to get the desired effect I mentioned in a reply I made earlier...zooming in, then going to top of Barad Dur.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>My Eye</strong><br />
      Hello everyone!<br />
      <br />
      Heh...this is my very first post on the Winamp forums...<br />
      <br />
      In fact, this thread was what made me register...lol<br />
      <br />
      While reading it, I decided to create my own version of The Eye of Sauron... And I think it turned out pretty well...so I just had to register to show it off...lol Perhaps this'll end up being the beginning of a productive stay here... Who knows...lol<br />
      <br />
      It even uses a slight variation of the superscope code given by UnConeD in this very thread for the pupil... But there's a comment included that says a bit more about it...<br />
      <br />
      A couple of notes about myself, though... This preset is only the 5th that I've created... None of the others are "released"...they all remain for my own private use... And so far, they're all pretty basic... But they're just what I want... Simple and highly reactive... I'm sure I'll share them someday soon...<br />
      <br />
      And without further ado... The Eye of Sauron!</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can create the zooming in then going up then stopping effect using dynamic movement quite easily if you already know how to make a zooming in and a going up on their own by using the if statement... you simply need to make a timer that increments and use if functions to make it do the zoom code for the first, say 3 seconds ish then do the going up then do nothing... i wont tell you exactly how to do it cos i guess that will take some of the fun out of it but id say that would be the best way to do it, how you'dd create the tower and everything? i dunno, the problem with zooming in with dm is everything will go blocky unless you start zoomed out, which means tiling so you'll lose the rest of the image... i don't think dm is actually the answer to that one now that i think about it more...<br />
      <br />
      you'dd probably want to make the tower from a 3d ssc then make that move towards you then down using the if statement, you could then use dm to fade the eye in...</p>
