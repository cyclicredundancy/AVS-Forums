      Anyway, I've been busy, but I couldn't resist posting one of my newer presets.<br />
      <br />
      Jaheckelsafar and everyone else who remembers me when I started AVS: Am I getting better? :up: :down:<br />
      <br />
      I've been alternating between concentrating on DMs &amp; Presets, and this preset is the result of combining one of my newest SSCs with a newer DM. I love it!<br />
      <br />
      :D I've got more where that came from, too! :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">climbing - seen too many like this before. It's basically just a kaleidoscopic interleave with a couple extras.<br />
      snow in hell - don't like that it has the lines of stars in it, but could be nice.<br />
      space popart in window - nice fiery effect don't like the blue specs in it caused by the stars though or the lines that sometimes appear.<br />
      space popart - nice painting preset. Gets a bit too grainy. Try taking out the stars to help this.<br />
      <br />
      Overall - 3.25</p>

      PS. Whats with that signature ? Santana is a great singer(Supernatural is in my top10 favourite albums) but i neva heard of the song America...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't really like the use of avi's in AVS - it's better to use AVS to generate the effect, but it is alright. The fiery effect is a bit grainy, though.<br />
      <br />
      [OFFTOPIC]About my sig: I downloaded a nice program that queries what song winamp is playing - sends it to a server, which creates a picture with the song title in it. America is a new song by Santana and features POD as well.[/OFFTOPIC]</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>2nd version</strong><br />
      I've been very busy lately, but I was messing around to come up with another decent render so I could get rid of the moving particles, like anubis suggested. I'll tinker around with it a little more later to get it a little more controlled, but I still think it's cool.<br />
      <br />
      Jaheckelsafar: Do you like oldschool style or not? :D<br />
      <br />
      I actually liked the SSC a lot better than the DM in the original (I actually made about 5 versions of the SSC and then picked my favorite one). Then I just looked through some of the halfway decent DMs I've made and added it to the SSC.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice.I like the effect :) Looking more at the preset an idea poped up in my mind :) You can make a sphere ssc or use the one that is on the forums and use the dm to deform it...I think it may look really cool :)</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Cmountford, it's a step into the new school presets, but nothing special basicly. I wouldn't use moving particles either like Anubis already said, and do you really need 800 numpoints in the scope? Also since the preset works quite fast a higher grid size of the dm could end up in better quality.<br />
      <br />
      Keep it up, you're on the right track :up:

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Back again!</strong><br />
      I've been pretty busy lately---but I made some presets in the time I had left over after I finished a math test today.<br />
      <br />
      It's odd, because they looked consistently better at the time I made the presets, but after loading other presets, they didn't look as good.<br />
      <br />
      This preset I find most appealing at a moderately low framerate, so some of you with faster computers than me might find it somewhat chaotic at framerates faster than 10. It doesn't always look that great, but if you wait a while, it gets some pretty cool effects :)<br />
      <br />
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      (now to talk about the presets I posted earlier)...<br />
      Well, I guess this is one of those times when I absolutely love a preset (especially the SSC), but others don't like it so much. But I guess that's the way it goes---so I think I'll stick with my original concept SSC on this one and not change it that much.<br />
      <br />
      I've still got a few versions of a preset that will probably be met with mixed opinions, so I'm holding off on posting that one until I work on it a little more, but I personally love it!</p>
