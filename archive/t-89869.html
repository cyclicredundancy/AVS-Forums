      <p class="post-content">Dude, LOOK IN THE VIS SECTION OF THE WEBSITE. :hang: There's tons of real 3D stuff, and a hundred times as much 2D and psuedo-3D stuff. Most of it's a lot better than the default presets.<br />
      Have you even TRIED to resize it? :wierd:<br />
      Also, it's "Oh My God, it's <b>Full</b> of Stars" by Lone (or Justin, can't remember - got rid of it a LONG time ago).<br />
      <br />
      And you're not going to make yourself look cooler by posting random winamp logos.</p>
