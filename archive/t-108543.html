<div class="posttext">Congratulations, you've managed to annoy everyone here by posting a question that was asked here just a few days ago. And a few days before that as well.<br />
<br />
You completely ignored the fat red text at the top of the posting form that instructed you to search the forums before posting your question. Do you think that you're special, that this doesn't apply to you? Or are you just too lazy to be bothered with consulting the sources available, so that you have to ask others for help instead?<br />
<br />
My advice is to read the pages you visit instead of impulsively doing things that get you to your goal with least required effort from yourself.<br />
<br />
Is it so weird to try and find existing sources of information instead of asking for a personalized answer from someone? I guess this is what you get with an education system in which self-study and research are non-existant.<br />
And your method is less effective as well. Now you've had to wait at least 1 hour and 35 minutes for an answer (the time between your post and mine), even though it was right under your nose.<br />
<br />
Go to the thread list of this forum and scroll down. You'll see a thread titled &quot;keep avs from cycling presets&quot;, which answers your question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I prefer to think that if they see what kind of work went into making it, and seeing what questions are there, people will recommend it to others who ask the same question.<br />

Maybe I'm just not cynical enough yet. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*sigh*<br />
<br />
I am with UnConeD on this I get very miffed if the answer is under peoples noses.<br />
<br />
I mean how could you miss the FAQ link?<br />
<br />
It is always at the top. :confused:<br />
<br />
I am trying to get the forums changed so that for the first say 5 posts you are redirected to another page which gives a list of FAQ's and tells you more about the search 'features'.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind if someone posted and said why they thought the FAQ was inadequate. Then maybe we could change something within them. Dunno??<br />
<br />
Maybe we should stop replying to obvious questions…………………<br />
<br />
You will learn the correct ways of the cynic Jaheckelsafar.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">A lot of people miss obvious things because they're simply too fast and have little patience. I always have the tendency to stop and look at everything before I click on.<br />
<br />
For example, a lot of people managed to initially completely miss the big '2' at the top (with 'Looking for Winamp 2?'), complaining that everything related to Winamp 2.x had been removed.<br />
<br />
Or people missing the 'Submit a Component' link in the components section. I mean, it's right at the top, inside the navigation bar. It's a logical place for it to be.<br />
<br />
And finally, check out the reviews for the featured component Poppler (http://www.winamp.com/components3/reviews.jhtml?rOT=C&amp;rOI=121627) (which makes the playlist side-bar resizable).<br />
People apparently download it without reading the description, only to comment later on that they don't notice anything different. I mean: the component description, the reviewer's comments AND the included readme (which opens up after installing) both mention what it does in the first paragraph.<br />
