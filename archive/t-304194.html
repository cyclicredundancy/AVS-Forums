      Hi All!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you all for the great work with your visualizations. I find the Visualizers really to enhance the musical experience and quite often also at parties use it as a backdrop with a video projector.<br />
      <br />
      I am doing a presentation on Music Visualizations and am wondering if anyone of you could help me or guide me to the correct direction, where I could find some more statistics on how often or how many music listeners normally view music visualizations while listening to music on their computer, while using WinAMP and/or music players in general?<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for all your help in advance!</p>

      <p class="post-content">i made a poll on last.fm once and not many people responded. almost all of them negative: <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/DeviantART/forum/277/_/434402" target="_blank">http://www.last.fm/group/DeviantART/forum/277/_/434402</a><br />

      i also did a presentation in school about AVS/visualizations in school once - but although i got top mark, not many people did understand what i was saying ^^; (it was in our english class, and i'm german so it was a foreign language for my classmates...)</p>
