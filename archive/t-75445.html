      <p class="post-content"><strong>avs math</strong><br />
      where would be a good place to look for avs-related math? i want to learn the ins and outs of pixel math (is that the right term?).<br />
      <br />
      this will make my presets sooo much better.<br />
      <br />
      thx! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">not to be mean or anything.....but once again as it has been said before many times.....there is no easy way to learn the super advanced math used in things such as super scope and dynamic movement...sure if you search the forum you will find great help from Unconed and lots of other helpful people but still,not to diss you, Unconed, or anyone else that has wrote helpful stuff on this forum, they can't document the whole avs math. thats what makes more elaborate avs so special....not everyone could do them...if they could that would take the joy from it....i mean if everyone could do the avs math then were would the challenge be? well thats just my point of view....search this forum and you will find some help....but the best way is to just fool around and experiment....thats what i have been doing for almost a year now and im no where close to anything like unconed or el-vis....soo anyway hopefully that explains some stuff...and sorry if that came out mean because it wasnt ment to be that way....well thats it i guess....see ya</p>

      <p class="post-content">I suppose the best place to look would be a classroom. :) Have you ever visited <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/" target="_blank">Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics</a>? Maybe they can be some help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It all depends on what you want to achieve. For starters, you might want to read up on the purpose of all the functions you can access in AVS (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, etc) so you understand the equations more. For example:<br />
      <br />
      d=sin(d) results in the "Tunneling" movement, which is characterized by an increasing move ******d with increasing distance from the center. Compare the graph of y=sin(x) with the graph of y=x. The second is a straight 45Â° line, while the first is close to 'y=x' near x=0, but takes a sudden bend downward at x=pi;. The distance between source 'y=x' and destination 'y=sin(x)' is the rate of movement.<br />
      <br />
      Secondly, if you want to do 3D superscopes, read up on analytical geometry. Understand how translations, rotations and such work and how to do them. Read up on projections (so you understand the 3D -&gt; 2D screen step).<br />
      <br />
      If you want to do 3D dynamic movements, there's really a lot of different ways to go. My 3D DM's work by using ray-tracing on a few basic shapes (planes, spheres, cylinders, ...) in their analytical form. I intersect the equation for a line that goes through the camera and through a DM-grid-point, with the equation for that certain shape.<br />
      <br />
      Another mathematical thing is Fractals. To understand them, you need to learn what complex numbers are: these are numbers containing the number 'i' which is the square root of '-1'. The square root of -1 does not exist in the realm of the real numbers, but if you assume it does exist (and equals 'i'), a whole new world of math opens up. Using complex math, one can link the trigonometry functions (sine/cosine) with the exponential functions and such. A neat one is:<br />
      PHP Code:</p>

      To prove this, you need an understanding of complex math and Taylor series and it's a bit beyond the scope of a simple post here(*).<br />
      <br />
      You can really apply several different math branches to AVS. It's also good to know how those pixels are built on the screen, but it won't get you far. Your term 'pixel-math' would only encompass things like RGB-colours, line/curve drawing and perhaps some filters (blur, water, etc).<br />
      <br />
      You can find most of the things I mentioned on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, but I think it doesn't offer enough explanation of something. Just some math-mumbo-jumbo that you wouldn't understand unless you already know what is being said. A good place to start is a good textbook or a classroom :).<br />
