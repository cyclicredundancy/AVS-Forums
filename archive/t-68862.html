			<strong>Complex Superscopes</strong><br />
		
		

		I was looking through some of the newpics in Winamp, and was amazed by the beauty and complexity of some of the superscopes.<br />
<br />
How do people come up with such great functions? Are they all topoplogy majors, or do they just fool around with things 'till something cool pops up?<br />
<br />
Also, is it just me, or are the instructions for the superscope a little weak. &quot;i is the position of the scope&quot; Okay, so what does that <u>mean</u>??? :confused:<br />
<br />
Can you tell me specificly what the following mean, and how the music effects them:<br />
<br />
i:<br />
v:<br />
w&amp;h:<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

		i: used to make the points on the scope<br />
v: what happpens to the scope when music is playing<br />
w &amp; h: width and height

		okay, you have a waveform. Let's go out on a limb and say the waveform is y=sin(x)<br />
at any point i on that waveform, v is sin(i)<br />
so if you put the waveform on a graph, limits 0,1,1,-1, x would be i and y would be v

		uh, i think what your trying to say is<br />
<br />
limits one y axis is 1 and -1 and for x its is 1 and -1<br />
v is used for disignating where the music is being used on the superscope and where its detected<br />
such as in example<br />
x=cos(t-i);<br />
y=sin(t+i)+v;<br />
would make a curving line that on the y axis would the waveform/spectrum be viewed.

		I'll try to go into a bit deeper explanation here.<br />
<br />
Let's take an example, we'll start with the simple:<br />
<br />
x=i;<br />
<br />
This small example would just create a simple line, no more, no less, no response, no nothing.<br />
<br />
x=0; would on the other hand create nothing but a small 1pixel dot at the middle of the horizontal scale in the AVS window.<br />
<br />
x=i; what is this then?<br />
i is a small function that creates a line, on every pixel it has a value on the X scale, starting at 0, going up to 1.<br />
It only ranges from 0 - 1 in the normal state without any extras.<br />
x=i-0.5; here we add &quot;-0.5&quot; to the statement, this would cause the i variable to be subtracted by 0.5, thus instead ranging from -0.5 to 0.5 on the horizontal scale.<br />
<br />
A normal example is:<br />
x=i*2-1; here we duplicate i by 2, this changes the range to 0 - 2, but we go -1, and it ranges from -1 to 1 and covers the whole horizontal scale. Get the idea?<br />
OK, let's move on.<br />
<br />
x=i*2-1; (We create the line covering the x- scale)<br />
y=v*.5; now what? we finally get to the &quot;v&quot; function, v gets input data from the sound, using waveform it ranges from -1 to 1, we'll stick to that.<br />
the sound makes this move up and down, every point reacting to that specific point on the &quot;sound scale&quot;.<br />
We use v*.5 because the normal wave is often to big.<br />
Now you've got a simple line covering the x-scale and reacting to sound.<br />
W and H are often not that useful, they are always equal to the width and height of your AVS window, and may be used if you want more specific details in &quot;N&quot;.(the number of points on your screen.)<br />
<br />
This should answer your question :cool: <br />
