<div class="posttext">ANY suggestions before I publish it?<br />
<br />
No is an answer too... ;)<br />
<br />
Who will be the first to respond?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like it, most of them are nice and comlplete, but some of them needs more work, ie: add a alpha blend to intro preset to hide that what DM creates in background. Also some of them could be general more smmoth (personaly I dont like sharp shapes). Finaly... keep experimenting with the code, this is the only way (I think) to make your prests unique and top notch.<br />
<br />
Greetz and good luck :)<br />
<br />
PS. Sorry for my english... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, you've really improved. :) I liked angel of darkness the best, but shifted scope and relax were good too. Some I'd seen posted here before, but that's cool. A little suggestion though. If you're going to release this to the public, don't include presets from previous packs unless they're substantially changed.<br />
<br />
Keep it up man, you're starting to take off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd November 2002, 15:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">First: thanks for all the replies<br />
<br />
Yaz: you don't have to aplologize for your English; at forums, we're used to have that... And BTW, your's isn't that bad - I'm Dutch, so if I can read it, so can most of the others ;):D <br />
And for Alpha blending: I haven't really begun on that, learning coding bit by bit. Will try it some day.<br />
<br />
Jaheckelsafar: The reason for having older presets in my pack, is because it is my 1.1'st pack. Not my first or second, my 1.1'st. A bit of the old pack (which by the way was never published anywhere else than here) and some new ones. i intend on publishing this one, but got a bit confused when i noticed that i have to make a installer for it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">All i can think of is that the ,-c gives errors.<br />
<br />
earlier i used the original ;-c and that gave even more errors.<br />
<br />
try this one and tell me if it works:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad, not bad at all. I'm working on the detailed review at the minute, so I'll just say that it'a well made pack and quite innovative in places.<br />
<br />
However: the intro preset looks susiciously like my Meant To Be from NDD2. :weird:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me it's not a rip... It's my first preset with the 'z' variable in a DM, and that means that it has to be very common...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, Ratta, if you want to be called that. :) Here's my detailed review:<br />
<br />
intro: This is nice, but the same problem that plagued my Meant To Be preset is also prevalent in here: it's just too damn static. 2.5/5<br />
Dreamz: Innovative use of the colour clip. A bit cliched, but nice overall. 2.5/5<br />
Kiss: Now THIS is original! Great work. I can't for the life of me figure out how the hell you did that. 3.5/5<br />
Moving twisting and spiralling scope: A cool mix of n00b and beyond with the simple MPs and the complex movement. Interesting is all I can say. 2.5/5<br />
New moving twisting and spiralling scope: This is a good improvement on the original. Perhaps a bit too &quot;staccato&quot; (not a very good way of saying it, is it?). 2.5/5<br />
Optical - Squashed Fly: Very good coding, and an awesome output! Still, some additional dynamics wouldn't have hurt. 3/5<br />
Optical Ring: Again, this preset just doesn't do enough. It is okay though. 2/5<br />
Optical Scope: Interesting use of colours, and the DM was a fine example of coding. Dynamics are slightly better. 3/5<br />
Radioactive B: I think you're cabaple of better than this. 1.5/5<br />
Relax: Very relaxing indeed. Sometimes the preset SSCs are just better. Great job with this! 3.5/5<br />
Shifted Scope: The &quot;layered&quot; colours give a great effect, even if the movement is overused. 3/5<br />
Soft Yellow: Quite true, the easier is sometimes the better, as this shows. I would've put the mirror at the top, but that's just me. 3/5<br />
Burning scope and snow: That's quite a contrast, but it makes for a good preset. The MP flashes in the centre of the screen are also a nice touch. 2.5/5<br />
In my mind: The dynamics in this one are definitely better. The feedback around the main renders are especially well made. 3.5/5<br />
Classic non-rect DM: An extremely nice pattern! Very relaxing, and a great example of code. 4/5<br />
Angel Of Darkness: This is a great preset. I'm not sure what the Convolution Filter was doing that a blur couldn't, but anyway. Great use of colour again. 4/5<br />
Optical - Landscape: Fairly plain, but a nice looking preset nonetheless. BTW, you can use pi=acos(-1) instead of 3.14159... 3/5<br />
<br />
The verdict: A very nice pack in places. Some things to remember: use dynamics a lot more. Nothing is more boring than a static preset. And keep coding! You had some very nice pieces of code in here, so keep at it! Overall, a pretty good pack.<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: :) :) :) :( :(<br />
Originality: :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
Overall: :) :) :) :( :( 1/2</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks a lot for the detailed review. It really helps me what to do or don't<br />
<br />
And for rhe ratta/rattaplan/;-c thing... I use ;-c in my presets, Rattaplan is basically an old chatname i used, but i changed it into ;-c because it was already used in a lot of chatboxes, but when i got on this forum, for the very first time ;-c was already in use, so i added the rattaplan part... And since Ratta is short for Rattaplan, i don't really care what to be called. Most people call me Ratta/Rattaplan already around here, so i accept both... <br />
<br />
Note that some of the presets are really old (relax is more than a year old (! :eek: !) ) my next pack (don't ask me when it'll be finished, haven't exactly started) will be a lot more shiny and dynamic in the style of the newest ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ratta, why don't you just not use that ;-c or anything in the first place?<br />
<br />
Intro: 2.5 stars<br />
Not very dynamic, and the background shape is kind of boring.<br />
<br />
Dreams: 4 stars<br />
Nice, I think it could be made better somehow; maybe not so much zoom on the beat?<br />
<br />
Kiss: 2.5 stars<br />
Again, fairly non-dynamic, and very repetitive<br />
<br />
Spiraling scope: 2.5 stars<br />
This one could be made a lot better; more dynamics, less back-and-forth movement, and the scope needs more detail<br />
<br />
Spiraling scope 2: 2.5 stars<br />
Ditto...<br />
<br />
Squashed fly: 3 stars<br />
I really don't like those fast-changing, non-linear warping movements, but you did a fairly good job with this one.  Again, it could be made a lot better.<br />
<br />
Optical ring: 3.5 stars<br />
It's good, but it gets really repetitive really fast.<br />
<br />
Optical scope: 2 stars<br />
I can't see a damn thing... :weird:<br />
<br />
Radioactive B: 3.5 stars<br />
Nice idea, but it needs to be more dynamic<br />
<br />
Relax: 1.5 stars<br />
I REALLY hate it when people use the example scopes: it's unoriginal, boring, and extremely distracting to the rest of the AVS.<br />
<br />
Shifted scope: 2.5 stars<br />
That bump really doesn't do much for the vis, and it slows things waaay down.  Other than that, it's not really unique or original....<br />
<br />
Soft yellow: 3.5 stars<br />
Same as Radioactive B<br />
<br />
Burning scope...: 2 stars<br />
Same as Relax<br />
<br />
Classic...: 2.5 stars<br />
You could make that DM look a whole lot better<br />
<br />
Angel of darkness: 3.5 stars<br />
Good, but it could be made better<br />
<br />
Optical landscape: 2.5 stars<br />
Again, those fast non-linear movements don't really appeal to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: 2.5 stars<br />
Technical: 2 stars<br />
Ideas: 3.5 stars<br />
Originality: 3.5 stars<br />
Overall: 3 stars</div></div><hr />

Ratta, why don't you just not use that ;-c or anything in the first place?<br />
<br />
Well, basically, i'd rather use only ;-c because i haven't used Rattaplan for years, I only used it as a second name since ;-c was already taken, just to NOT use it... Hoping people would simply call me ;-c, but almost everybody uses Rattaplan now. <br />
Guess i'll have to deal with it. I don't really mind what to be called in forums, but i use ;-c as my artist's name in my presets. I don't care that Windows can't handle the ; I refuse to change my name for some piece of ever-failing software... :hang:</div></div><hr />
