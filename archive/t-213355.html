			<strong>undo/redo button</strong><br />
		
		

		I may sound like a complete moron for not knowing but what exactly does the undo button do?<br />
<br />
yes, I know, it undoes your latest actions, but what decides how many 'steps' it goes back or what other paremeter decides where to jump back to? <br />
<br />
For example, I had been working on a new preset annex codetest (used a T2) and decided to mess around with it. it took me ages to undo the last line I wrote because it captured every character I wrote.<br />
<br />
Test failed so I continued with something else.. one of my first attempts on 3D DM's.<br />
<br />
I kinda had it working and I was messing around with how to define 'z1'. I tried some different things and normally I'd simply use backspace and stuff, but as I said, I was also trying around with the undo/redo thing. <br />
Instead of going back one character it immediately jumped back to my previous texer2-preset and when I hit the redo button, I ended up with an empty list, leaving the redo button inactive.<br />
<br />
The undo button returned me to my texer2 preset that I didn't want.<br />
<br />
So again my question: what exactly does it do?

		yeah, i also have that problem: undo/redo seems to save the changes you make rather randomly. Sometimes it undoes the smallest change (eg. one charachter) and sometimes it goes back in huge steps deleting whole effectlists that i've added. <br />
<br />
That's why i don't use it that often. Most of the time i save the preset myself before i i do bigger changes (what unfortunately ends up in a huge amount of completely messed up folders with presets...).

		[guess] I think it saves the state of AVS every so often (when certain conditions are met probably) and when you press undo it just loads that state [/guess]

		assuming that your guess is proved to be correct, is there a way to find out those saving triggers? That way we could work more precisely with undo/redo.

		It could be time based, a certain number of code recompiles, your guess is as good as mine. Of course I could be going down completely the wrong track.

		in other words: there is no way to find out... ok, another bungled avs-feature we have to get by with...

		the textbox undos are the default windows undos. these only store the last edit and seem to wait for you to 'stop typing' before they recognise a change.<br />
<br />
the main avs undo looks like it stores the last change(s) you made to the preset tree or a component. i have no idea how big the buffer is.<br />
<br />
they behave very consistently for me. the thing that may be confusing is that they are seperate. i've never undone a load of tree changes in one undo by accident, but this does happen in textboxes... its just how windows undo works. <br />
<br />
using the main undo will change code text based on the tree changes and this will ignore any actual code changes in the main undo until you update the tree. (i think)
