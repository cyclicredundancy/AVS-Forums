<div class="posttext">I do like it.  Are crits okay?  It's the mono-tone thing.  I'm not in love with how the colors are tone on tone.  If you can get a color wheel and have the background color be complimentary to the texer2/foreground color, it would really pop!  Basically just grab a color wheel(easy to find in stores for under $5.00 or free online), and look at the colors.  There are entire sites about color theory, so I won't bother clogging your brain up with all the different ways colors can be complimentary.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick and basic semi-rule of thumb for complimentary colors.  Colors opposite each other on the color wheel, compliment each other.  So blue compliments orange, while green compliments red, and so on and so forth.  Color theory is a much bigger and complex subject than that but still it's a good starting point for colors.  Interrestingly, warm look closer while cool colors look far away, so orange in front of a blue background will be more dynamic than blue in front of an orange background.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have said anything, but I think strong use of colors and tones(tones are the levels of color from dark to light and back again), can take this really good preset and make it a great preset.  Just remember what I said about warm coming forward and cool receding, and also dark recedes while light/bright comes forward.   So if you really want green in the front, go with a bright green, and have a deep red background it will just come right out at us.<br />
<br />
Those are all optical illusions really.  <br />
<br />
If you're interrested, I can link you to a shareware app that does all that work for you(you choose what kind of complimentaries you want) and then choose one color and the others are chosen for you and shown on your choice of &quot;product&quot;, things like web-pages and product packaging, simple dummies but they give you an idea of what a finished project will look like whith the colors you choose:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">or i could just be happy with the colours the way they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend.  As I said, I do like the preset. It was just an idea/suggestion.  Cool thing about suggestions, they don't have to be taken or used:)  If it's any consolation, you're still about a zillion times better at this stuff than I am.<br />
<br />
It's my fault really, I'm more used to the Epi-forums.  Still have to get used to these:).</div></div><hr />
