<div class="posttext">don't like many of these...not nice to watch<br />
<br />
the best one here is feel the box, but that still needs work<br />
<br />
btw...pi can be calculated as acos(-1)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">elvissuperspiroupgradebyshape - Nothing special.  Try making something of your own from the ground up instead of just taking something already done and adding colors that don't follow any sort of pattern.<br />
Wild Circle Havyx3 - Nothing special - at least throw a nice effect on it.  All it is is some ssc's rotating on the surface of a sphere with some stars.<br />
Magic of the geometry final - Very weirdly moving ssc, that would be alright if you made the colors a little nicer and added a nice effect to it.<br />
Vertical Audio Scanner - Don't like.  It's just a moving line with weird colors.  Add effects to make it somewhat interesting.<br />
Mind Out Of Limits - SSC isn't terrific and the effect isn't much.  Apparently I don't have the font that you have.  If you want others to see it the same as you, you are going to have to package the font with the presets and create an NSIS installer that will install them.<br />
Time to make a life - Anyone here could tell you that I would absolutely abhor this preset.  Moving Particles are very rarely used in a way that pleases me, and this is by far among the worst.  The Dynamic shift is just the default one - nothing done to even make it better.  Sorry, but I hate this preset.<br />
Mind Out Of Limits 2 - Almost a decent preset.  Try to use better colors, and add a more interesting effect - perhaps a DM.<br />
Mind Pressure - Needs better colors and a better effect.<br />
Feel the box - Synch the cubes and add a nice effect to it.<br />
Overall: 1.75.  You really need to choose better colors - a simple change from red to green to blue like that doesn't look that good and adds way too many colors with some of your ssc's.  Also, learn how to code DM's - they will help you make much better effects.  These presets aren't the normal n00b presets, but I wouldn't consider them to be better than some of the normal n00b presets.  They are almost all based on the same SSC, and they aren't eyecapturing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very good ssc's, but you need something in the background and some movement to ALL of them.  If your friend can create Dynamic Movement as well as he can create ssc's, then he will be a great AVS artist.  All in all, use more effects.</div></div><hr />

took two layers, one for the MK, one for the 2, and applied the same effects (bevel, emboss, texture, (i think).<br />

<div class="posttext">Here is my review of these presets.<br />
<br />
elvissuperspiroupgradebyshape - It is just a kind of ugly superscope I think it is more of a downgrade than an upgrade.<br />
<br />
feel the box - Kind of boring but OK.<br />
<br />
magic of the geometry final - Not very nice. <br />
<br />
Mind out of Limits 2 - Just a bunch of dots.<br />
<br />
Mind out of Limits - Same as above but worse.<br />
<br />
Mind pressure - More dots but not terrible.<br />
<br />
Time to make a life - Only beat responsive. Very simple. Doesn't look that good.<br />
<br />
Vertical Audio Scanner - Ugly.<br />
<br />
Wildcircle Havyx3 - Kind of ugly and boring.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this review is too harsh. These aren't bad but they could be a lot better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I kinda liked some of them, but none really felt like a finished preset. That and more beat responce that a quick speed change would be more noticable.</div></div><hr />

@ou got to thank me for this review, because I took lot of pains to make this one, because m@ ke@board wont work properl@!<br />
<br />
elvis superspiro upgrade - i think elvis made this when there was no getosc function, @ou can improve the rotations using getosc. the colours are n00b. tr@ using colour maps and other trans stuff to get good colours if @ou cant code them<br />
<br />
wild circle :<br />
whats this! :<br />
pi=3.1415926535897932384626433832795<br />
@ou can alwa@s set pi=acos(-1) OR pi=acos(0)*2<br />
tr@ improving the colours.<br />
<br />
magic of geometr@ :<br />
use maximum blending, looks ugl@ otherwise<br />
  <br />
vertical audio scanner:<br />
@ou could have made something interesing out of this,<br />
see technicall@ incorrect-sound s@stems b@ tuggummi.<br />
<br />
mind out of limits:<br />
ehh?!?!?!<br />
Ðóëèò íà ìåäëÿêàõ!<br />
boring preset.<br />
<br />
time to make a life.<br />
increse distance from center, use more colours<br />
<br />
mind out of limits 2:<br />
this is much better<br />
<br />
mind pressure:<br />
tr@ changing the colour code,<br />
@our colours look the same<br />
<br />
feel the box:<br />
change of st@le and colours!<br />
best preset of the pack! :up:<br />
<br />
overall 2 points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's ok to revive threads if it's his thread and it's still on the subject. Which it is. DOn't critisise members unless you know what to critisise.<br />
<br />
As for the preset. It's a little boring but i can see experimentation with scopes which can't be bad. Those scopes look weird and all the code doesn't seem to do much. It just seems to rotate a little circle of lines around 3d very slowly. Try changing x1, y1 and z1 to different things to get different results. eg for a sphere:<br />
<br />
x1=sin((i*tpi*50))*(cos(i*pi+pi/2)*0.5);<br />
y1=cos((i*tpi*50))*(cos(i*pi+pi/2)*0.5);<br />
z1=cos(i*pi)*0.5;<br />
(make sure you set the variables in the &quot;init&quot; box: &quot;n=300; pi=acos(-1); tpi=pi*2;&quot;<br />
<br />
You've made (?) some 3d rotation and made crappy use out of it. Being able to code doesn't necessarily make good presets. You need to know how to make things look good.</div></div><hr />
