			<strong>pimpbot appreciation</strong><br />
		
		

		since the first release of <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org" target="_blank">pimpbot</a> in <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1020788#post1020788" target="_blank">january 2002</a>, pimpbot has proven to be a convenient way to create installers tailor-made to install avs presets. i remember writing script to install presets manually, and i also remember bad scripted installers or lame winzip selfextractors being used to distribute presets.<br />
<br />
as much as a gift pimpbot might have been to many of the artists from the inner scene, there's still a lot of badly packaged downloads available (especially on winamp.com). for multiple times i tried to speak to the responsible persons on this sites, including many forums moderators. still a recommendation in the download section or a news article presenting pimpbot to the masses of artists on this site has never been available.<br />
<br />
the idea was to collect a few presets from the artists of the community in order to release a pimpbot appreciation pack. i've got to admit that the main drive that made me write pimpbot where the many releases i was (and am) doing myself, and i never minded sharing the tool (and later its source-code). if you appreciated pimpbot in the past, you can now show your appreciation by contributing to the pack i got in mind.<br />
<br />
submissions go to &lt;my nick on this board&gt; at <a href="http://visbot.net" target="_blank">visbot.net</a><br />
<br />
no need to rush things, lets have late august in mind as a lose deadline.<br />
<br />
thanks for your support!

		Never used pimpbot. I appreciate the lesser ammount of crappy installers (because of pimpbot) though :p
