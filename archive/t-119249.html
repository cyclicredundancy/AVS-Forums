			<strong>Preset switching</strong><br />
		
		

		Can we have an option to do a preset switch every n beats instead of every n seconds.<br />
<br />
Every n bars would be even better :)<br />
<br />
Of course this is hard to determine for the start of a song, so what I would suggest is as soon as the beat detection algorithm achieves a certain level of certainty (or n seconds have elapsed into the song) you back calculate how many beats/bars have ellapsed since the beggining of the track using the current bpm estimation.<br />
<br />
These options could be hardcoded or configurable.<br />
<br />
But anyways preset switching using this method instead of on a timer would be far more natural and in keeping with beat responsive vis.

		Unfortunately that can't be done in an APE. :( As I understand, AVS doesn't give you access to that kind of thing.

		Good beat detection isn't that easy; and a perfect beat detection system is almost impossible.  Our brains' beat detection system is far more complex than anything we may ever hope to program.<br />
Bar detection would be damn near impossible because of this.  Best thing to do would just multiply n by the bpP (beats per phrase) of the song you're listening to

		I didn't mean for AVS to give presets access to it, I meant for AVS to do it itself as it does do its own beat detection which is fairly decent.

		The fact now is, AVS has been left pretty much undeveloped for more than a year. Any current development is done by APE authors within the confines of what an APE can do.<br />
<br />
We heard from an unreliable source that AVS is being streamlined for the next major release of Winamp3, but we don't get our hopes up.<br />
<br />
That's why your suggestion was shot down a bit.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, someone PM Rovastar to add a simple <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=119249" target="_blank">link</a> behind the 'better beat detection' suggestion on the wishlist to this thread (I'm NOT doing it anymore).

		I like that idea too...sometimes I just do that manually, but it would look so much cooler and work better if Winamp did this for us.
