      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Wikipedia entry</strong><br />
      I've set up an AVS "stub" page at Wikipedia. I think this could serve as some kind of a knowledgebase for AVS, perhaps tutorials could be posted, etc. In any case, it definitely needs more information, so anyone who wants to help, go ahead: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Visualization_Studio" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Winamp AVS</a>.<br />
      <br />
      For those of you who are lost, Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that anyone can contribute to, no sign-ups or anything are necessary. You just directly edit the articles (by clicking "edit") and add or delete whatever you want. Of course every page is closely watched by other users and can be reverted if anyone vandalizes. It's a very nice system, and I think AVS can be well-represented there if forum members contribute. I suggest reading some basic help articles at Wikipedia before editing it though, so we can do this right and not have to keep reverting because people mess it up.</p>
