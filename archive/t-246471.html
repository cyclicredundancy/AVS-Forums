<div class="posttext">ok everyone told me to go out and make my own preset just for once. no other peoples presets were used to make this. all but the on\off effectlist code is mine the on\off is fragmers from the tips n tricks section thx. anyway this happens to be a painting preset i made. you might enjoy this. i've attempted to keep it as clean as possible but if you spot any bugs please work them out if you want to.<br />
<br />
i do have one request. if anyone knows how to make a 3d rotating painter preset please tell me how i will make a partnership with anyone who help me on this.<br />
<br />
my goal here is to make a preset that can beused without someone knowing their having fun heheheh mainly if you get bored in an office you might like this.</div></div><hr />

but to the backround change request i could not do that. my time is limited with currently working on a joint project in programming with dinosorceror on lavadomefive.com for faibanx3d. heh the physics engine he\she made is hilarious anyone interested in it will like the idea of stress relief on a ragdoll dummy. mwuhahaha throws dummy around.<br />

<div class="posttext">Ok Javs<br />
i got the time to do some work on the backrounds. and just for you i included two yes two special theme backrounds for the preset.<br />
<br />
because of the size of the files i had to have them split into 3.<br />
<br />
the first file is the zip then the rest will be the .z01 and .z02 files.<br />
<br />
bows to the almighty winzip for making splitting zips easier<br />
<br />
heh anyway just download the files and put them in the same directory or folder so that way winzip will know where the files are. ok chow. <br />
p.s. you will enjoy the theme backrounds Javs :cool: ;) :D :) :p :winamp: <br />
<br />
also because of the winamp forums file extension file i'll seal the .z files in zips ok.</div></div><hr />
