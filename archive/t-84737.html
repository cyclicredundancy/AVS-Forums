		hi again, here's one I'v made through random messing around. It looks like an eye that changes color and emits swirling liquid type stuff &amp; it goes black when there's no music!. hmmm, I like it anyway I wish I knew how it worked...<br />
<br />
I'v renamed it a .TXT file so I could upload it. Change it to .AVS to use it :igor:

		Dynamic distance modifier is a movement that works on polar coordinates (defined  by angle and distance). For every circle of points that lie on the same distance of the center, AVS calculates a new 'd' based on the code you supply and copies the target pixels into the source.<br />
<br />
If you want to do more than just distance, then a dynamic movement is your friend.

		cheers,<br />
one more thing, is it possible to pass variables between elements in the effect list? I'm trying to make an oscilloscope-shaped line that changes color depending on the spectrum data, is this possible? thanks for the help,<br />

		Far as I know, you can't pass variables in AVS. You can sync variables, or snag a spectrum or ociliscope(sp?) value.

		A good trick to use if you want random behaviour that is synchronized between several elements, is to use getosc() at a certain index. You'll have the added advantage that the range is related to the music and is slightly responsive to it.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can use the functions getosc() and getspec() to access all the sound data. Use a width of '0' if you want a single sample.

		unconed, why dont you edit your abeoba.ape that might support multi-colored arms?<br />
or even like this: each arm a different color, cycle color, and each arm cycles through a set of colors made by user that would have multiple colors in each arm (i could say...)

		I'm not going to update amoeba anymore... it was just a little test. Maybe if I ever get my own AVS code compiler working.
