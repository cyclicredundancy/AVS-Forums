      <p class="post-content"><strong>When Database Work Correctly?</strong><br />
      I am tired of database mistakes, before this time I mean 1 year or 2 years ago Winamp.com work correctly without any mistakes.<br />
      But in year 2003 many problems &amp; mistakes found in Winamp.com.<br />
      I mean wrong ratings, reviews, ...<br />
      I want to know this matter is because of VIRUS or something else?<br />
      And why staff don't solve this problem?<br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">They recently changed the system, I believe.<br />
      <br />
      It's not a virus - just poor programming. I think that they are trying to fix it, but I may be wrong - it just seems to be getting worse and worse.<br />
      <br />
      It's even worse on our(the reviewers) end. Sometimes I have to review a pack 3 times or more before it decides to work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">*Sigh* Yeah sadly the reviewing system and database is messed up.<br />
      <br />
      Nullsoft keep saying they will fix it but they do not. :(<br />
      <br />
      I know they are planing a new site. For when WA5 comes out (soon I believe) but even then I do not think the database will be fixed. :(<br />
      But I they do not get a seperate section for teh AVS preset packs I will likely scream or quit. (The initial mock up has not catered for this.... :( )</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah Rova! Don't quit on us just because you don't get paid of reviewing, the database screws up so you have 10x more work, no avser respects you because you're a milkdropper.......<br />
