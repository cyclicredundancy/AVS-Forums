      <p class="post-content">You can add several blurs or a convolution filter (Assuming the preset is in an effect list). Slowdown will be rampant.<br />
      <br />
      There are some other options, but they are preset-dependent... Upload (up to 5) the presets that you want to soften... maybe we can help... (This doesn't mean the rest of you newbies, k? we do this once in a while, but certainly not everyday)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe his using pixel doubling? Presets tend to look a bit "crunchy" when using pixel doubling :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Open the avs editor and go to: Settings -&gt; Display and uncheck Pixel Doubling<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      On the other hand if you don't understand english then there is little we can do to help :igor:</p>
