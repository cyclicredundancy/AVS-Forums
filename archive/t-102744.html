<div class="posttext">i've finally finished my fifth pack, i doubt it will be available to download from winamp.com for a while yet so i thought that i'd post up a deskmod link so that you can all tell me what you think and i can refine it if necessary before it goes up here.<br />
<br />
anyway... enjoy!<br />

<div class="posttext">alright, you asked for a review, i'll give ya one :)<br />
<br />
<br />
ascension - nice shape and look, but it doesnt do anyting to the music.<br />
<br />
tranquil ocean 2 - nice how you got the look of the ocean, but it was slow on my comp...<br />
<br />
sphere of influence 2 - Pretty cool looking, but the effect looks alot like the look on &quot;duo - happy dance 2&quot; that comes with winamp 3.<br />
<br />
particle tracks - reminded me of ascension, but it did something with the music. I liked it :up: <br />
<br />
Hall of warped mirrors - nice! :up: :) What else can i say :D<br />
<br />
Dotted Surface 3 - Nice look, without the dots :p<br />
<br />
Heart of Darkness - Too many ssc's in the shell. I liked it better with just 2 of em for the shell really. You can see the center better.<br />
<br />
Sound Vortex - :down: It was slow, and i thought it was ugly. Sorry, gotta tell it like it is..<br />
<br />
Maddening of the Planes - cool effect, but i didnt like all the colors...<br />
<br />
Distortion Plane II - Nice, but a bit too slow. Takes it awhile to get good too.<br />
<br />
Glass Cube- Interesting concept, but i didnt like it :down: <br />
<br />
Mechanical Curviture 2 - Nice, reminded me quite a bit of elvis - superspiro though.<br />
<br />
Harsh on the Eyes - thought it was ugly! :down: you're right, it WAS harsh on the eys &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Wave analysis 4 - Nice, looked like the big bang or something :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Geez, I've been remiss in my &quot;reviewing&quot;. Gimme a few.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanx for the review. i'm glad you took the hint, you should always try to review as much stuff as possible :) that way you can get into everyones 'good books'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, i'll make another review then. The sides of the shape in your avatar look outta proportion :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">its mathematically perfect, thats what matters to me as a mathematician, the distortions are probably from the high perspective due to the size of the shape relative to the perspective scale used. dodecahedrons are nice, that particular one contains the co-ords of the unit cube as vertices and the rest is defined in terms of the golden ratio. I'll replace it with an icosahedron when i go up a rank in terms of numbers of posts. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
ummmm... yea...<br />
<br />
I just think it looks weird cause the back looks like it has more sides that the front :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's cause of the way the perspective is done. The quick way doesn't quite do it right, but it's only realy visible close to the viewing plane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Shame you can't just drop some OpenGL into AVS. i.e.<br />
<br />
glHint(GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_NICEST);<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Then I could do some nice HQ 3D effects, like volumetric fog and particle systems using bitmaps. Ah well... I guess it would also strip the fun from it entirely too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Zevensoft: without the spyware though ;).<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like glEnable(GL_LINE_SMOOTH); for superscopes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th September 2002, 02:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i'd prefer to have something like<br />
glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT, GL_FILL);<br />
...<br />
glBegin(GL_POLYGON);<br />
...<br />
glEnd();<br />
<br />
available for superscope, that would make my life easier!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow! i totally neglected to look at this (DoH!:igor:)<br />
<br />
Its really neat, i liked the ocean one, and the heart of darkness (that needs a little less white space )<br />
<br />
overall, great job! (the particle effects were among the best ive seen)<br />
<br />
(the SSc for the Intro was schweet)</div></div><hr />
