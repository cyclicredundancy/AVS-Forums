		Dude, you have to be more specific.<br />
<br />
Right now, the only answers you'll get are gonna be things like. &quot;You open the editor, add some stuff, and type someting in the boxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mess around a bit. when yoiu get to something you don't get, check back here and ask about it.<br />
<br />
A few people have taken the time to puy together a bit of a tutorial in one of the threads. Look for it and you may find something useful.

		1) Read the FAQ<br />
2) Search the forums<br />
<br />
We don't mind helping people, but almost every week someone comes along and asks the exact same question: &quot;How do I make AVSes, please teach me.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are tons of helpful guides around... not to mention the fact that you can learn the basics by exploring yourself. AVS doesn't bite you know :p.

			<strong>here's something</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Some of this is stuff I made back in December when I and another student were doing AVS for our math project.  I was teaching him while at the same time trying to learn it, so that's why some of the documents seem to be kind of clueless, but I thought I'd just attach them anyway.  If you can ignore the deadlines &amp; comments to &quot;Albert&quot; (the other student), I hope you can learn something from this.  I also included sneak peeks at some stuff in my book<br />
<br />
Warning:  it is illegal and in poor taste to copy any graphics, text, or other material in part or whole.  Note that some of the material is explaining other people's presets, so not all of the presets saved in the zip file are original (most of them aren't).<br />
<br />
note:  becasue of the file size limitations, I had to leave out one of my best documents explaining algebra.  It by itself is too big for a zip file.  :(<br />
<br />
Note:  You'll have to open several of them as Read-Only (copyright protection for &quot;dummies&quot;).  There's easy ways to get around it, but it keeps the dumb people from copying everything.

		Someone is probably annoyed by me constantly mentioning <a href="http://www.geocities.com/avsdiscussion" target="_blank">this site</a> but it's got tutorials that might be of use to people who are new in preset  creation.:) <br />
<br />
By the way... suggestions and comments are welcomed.
