Hello, new and enthusiastic member! You have discovered AVS, that is wonderful! AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement; it is a fun tool to play with and it is a great thing to watch while you play your favourite music. <br />
<br />
However, it seems you have asked a AVS related question that has been asked and answered several times before. Here in the AVS forums we respect and value such skills as:<br />
<br />
- Searching (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php)<br />
Simply put: Search before you post. You might have already seen the red bold letters and the search (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php) link above the posting window, or you might have missed them for some reason. By searching for the answer you're looking for, you will get the answer you want immediately, instead of posting a question that has been posted before and waiting for a reply which usually takes several hours, sometimes even days to get, and it might not even be a reply you will appreciate.<br />
<br />
- Reading the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567)<br />
If you didn't know, FAQ stands for: Frequently Asked Questions. It simply is a list of questions and answers to questions that over the long period of time have been asked multiple times. Since answering these questions each time they are asked can become boring, as well as time wasting, we prefer usually not to answer them directly. Rather, we will point you to the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567), where a pre-written and descriptive answer can be read. The FAQ explains the situation and solution much better than a quick reply by someone else.<br />
<br />
- Checking out the tutorials (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060)<br />
Striving to be an AVS artist? Great! We like new people around here. Have a question about how to make something in AVS? Before you post your question, it is recommended and expected by other AVS artists that you read the AVS tutorials enlisted here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060), before you post your question. The tutorials are a wonderful source created by long time AVS artists to learn the basics and sometimes even the more complex features of AVS. Realize that since this is a hobby for most of us, no one is going to hold your hand and teach you AVS from ground up. Believe it or not, but all of us have learned AVS by ourselves. Some AVS artists didn't even have these tutorials at their disposal and they had to learn everything from scratch by experimenting! You are indeed lucky to have such great resources available to you. Use them well and wisely, but most importantly read them before you ask.<br />
<br />
Remember these guidelines and you should have no problems in your AVS future. Good luck, have fun, and welcome to the AVS forums! :up:<br />

lol... Just, the car there has more personality than Herbie (all sequels combined) and it runs along with whatever music you put on. Looking at it is addictive. Just make sure not to chuck it on at a party. That would kill the social element...<br />
<br />
Big fan of all of you; you do know design. Just... I sat and stared at the car for about fifteen minutes, giggling the whole time... Writing a fan letter was neccesary :)<br />

Hmm, sounds to me that you're only watching the default presets, am i right? Also seems you haven't updated winamp in a while, because the default presets have also been changed :p<br />
<br />
What you need is to get out in the plugins section and download a few packs, then be amazed :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Jetwash and its remix were certainly interesting from a technical standpoint, but I think WFC2 would've been just as good without them. I think it's Ishan's, Denkensiefursich's and ASD5A's presets that really made that pack.<br />
<br />
I don't mind saying that, overall, I consider it slightly better overall than WFC3... but WFC3 was pretty good, too. I enjoyed being a part of that one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, swerving slightly back on topic, UnConeD's presets included with WinAmp (especially the Zero-G Maze variants) were one of the major things that got me interested in AVS to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Speaking of the forums compilations...<br />
<br />
With WotL's absence, do we continue on with the fourth installation of the series? On his own forum, he said that he didn't want to run this one. I volunteered, but it was never set in stone. On his DA page, he noted to Tugg that it would be either Jheriko or I.<br />
<br />
I could email WotL and see what he's got to say on the subject. J, what's your feel on this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally... I don't care :)<br />

I will have to contribute a super preset though... no one has pushed the tech lately, and I still have a few of those tricks up my sleeves which have never been seen before in avs...<br />

<div class="posttext">WW: I sure am.<br />
<br />
Anyway.... In my opinion, WFC3 isn't even near WFC2 in terms of quality. It was interesting, but it wasn't really good. I didn't see or rate the first one. I'm all for the 4th one though. Even numbers seem to be the better packs in this case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to be to work in an hour, but when I return there will hopefully be a reply with good news. If all goes well, a thread will be started shortly. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've been checking out the compilations you reccomended here, Tuggy and there is some pretty sweet stuff here. Good work on that Über-Designers.com. This is pretty cool! :D<br />
<br />
Of course there's absolutely no way I can ever get through all of these things here. Chuck on random and take it as it comes. Rather like this Hearts Of Space collection I got here. Over four days of music (98 hours worth), so the best of luck on hearing every song, hehe...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">For the AVS regulars, those packs are just a scratch of the surface and definetly not &quot;too much&quot;, i myself have made about 700+ presets which i think is about 3,5 times more than what in those packs together :p (just an example of how much AVS presets there is out there alltogether)<br />
<br />
But i guess for a casual viewer it is a bit overwhelming, still i recommend you go hunt for more AVS packs, i'd say anything with a 4-5 star rating (even 3,5 stars are pretty good compilations sometimes)</div></div><hr />

Some of my later presets are still some of the most advanced tech ever used in AVS, even tho they are pretty old now.</div></div><hr />
