			<strong>More Hotkeys than your Keybord can take...</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi, you all!<br />
<br />
I am bussily writing on a litle Tool calling <b>HOTLIST</b> to make the well known <i>&quot;there are not enought Hotkeys&quot;</i> problem ending. First of all i do it for my own purpose but as i decided to publish it, i thought there might be some guys out there that would like to have some features added. So take your chance and help to make this Tool a real good one. If the feature you want is not shown in the list below, please send me your suggestion and i 'll try hard to add it. Ill probably finish the Tool in a Week, look forward to it! :D<br />
<br />
Feature List:<br />
-Grabs the actual Hotkey-Set from AVS and saves it<br />
-Creates empty Hotkey-Sets that you can fill with any AVS-Presets<br />
-Edits your Hotkey-Set in Detail<br />
-Adds Names and a Picture to each Hotkey (if you want)<br />
-Provides you with a VJ Mode that gives you a second window with the  <br />
 Hotkeys, their Names and the Picture out of the selected Hotkey-Set<br />
<br />
At the Moment i'm trying hard to make it all working with drag &amp; drop but i could need some advice from a more experienced programmer with this feature, so if you some Know How with Delphi, send me a Mail!<br />
;)

		Something to control the style of transitions in your package would be nice. Infact could your tool allow us a new set of transitions between presets, or other global effects over the presets you are calling?

		Im Sorry, i don't think that global custom transition will be possible. This is something that is based ont AVS's internal API and there's no way do add any global effects. You could only add some local ones using APE's.<br />
The real strenght of my Tool is creating hundreds of individual Hotkey Presets, either by making a set in AVS as usual and grab it, or even better, directly in Hotlist. <br />
<br />
But if you use AVS for Perfomances like me and want to change the Type of Transition used while AVS, runs i have a good solution for you. Use your TV Out  combined with Overlay. If you don't know how look at my comment at <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=76893" target="_blank">(link)</a>. So if Active just open the Editor Window and change the Transition as you like. Noone will realize that you work in window mode as the overlay is fullscreen scaled...<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your idea, hope i could help!

		Hey Guys!<br />
<br />
Im finished with including Drag&amp;Drop, just some small Bugs with the picture stuff and it's ready. :cool:  I think i 'll upload it on Monday or Tuesday! <br />
Has anyone an idea how to submit a preset file directly to AVS? I want to include a preview funcion but that seems realy difficult...

		I did it!<br />
The ultimate AVS-VJ Tool is now ready. I'm sorry that you had to wait, but it took me 2 days longer than i expected. Download it from here: <a href="http://home.pages.at/ptcle/Downloads/Hotlist.zip" target="_blank">HOTLIST - Download</a><br />
Using this tool, AVS becomes even better controllable than MD, i can only advise to test it yourself. Unfortunately i had no time to create a help file, it 'll follow within the next days. Anyway, it won't be a problem to figure out its functions. Here are some tips on how to use it:<br />
-Unpack the file and copy it to a new Directory (you could use others too but it's not recommended)<br />
-add Presets or Pictures by using Drag &amp; Drop<br />
-change and remove Presets by using the Context Menu<br />
<br />
Enjoy it, a Help File and a German Version will be available in near future...

If i knew how i would already have... seems to me as if Delphi isn't the right tool to create ape's. And even if it's possible i wouldn't know where to start as there are only few ape-descriptions for C but i never found some Delphi sample code...<br />
<br />
Hey Atlass, if you'Ve finished UT and tryed it out yet, write me what you think about it... a bugfixed version will arrive tomorrow.

		Heya Magic.<br />
<br />
Iv'e been playing U.T online for 2 years, and have a clan of friends who are all very good players/friends of mine. We are called clan[FrEaKs] :eek: <br />
<br />
Counter Strike (Half-life) seems to be more popular world-wide however for pure FPH (Frags Per Hour)action, nothing competes with a fast paced game like UT.<br />
<br />
It's a game best suited to online deathmatch against 10 or more opponents, or in CLAN games 4 vs 4. It's a very fun game !<br />
<br />
If your more into the adventuring side of things.. Unreal 2 is coming out sometime late this year. Should also be a winner :) <br />
<br />
<br />
I frequently project U.T at our nights to the beats of high-energy music.. Looks wild on the ***HUGE*** projector screen !  Most ppl are like WTF ? hehe :D

		HMMMMM<br />
 Magic X you say it shouldn't be tooo hard to work out your hot key thingy. Well call me stoopid but I can't seem to get it too work.<br />
 Could you explain simply how to set it up so you can simply exchange hotkey presets. Say I have two lists of hot keys A1 and B2 that I wanted to go between. How do I do this???

The thing <b>is</b> quite simple. if you want to get a hotlist loaded, select it from the list and click 'load'. this will load the complete hotlist into avs and you'll be able to activate the pre's you loaded up by the hotkeys you assigned them to. it's important that you activate the avs window first (click it) because avs only accepts hotkeys when it's focused. if you're tired of set a, select set b, load it and click avs again.<br />
<br />
If you're wondering why you've to click 'load' all time, let me explain: let's say you're a professional VJ and you have about 200 pre's you want to use. You wouldn't assign your pre's to the shift+... Hotkeys because that's anoying, so you've 10 hotlist each with 20 pre's and screenshots of them. as you've loaded them you may whish to preview some other hotlist to find another pre that suits well. as this is done by selecting you'll have to click load. <br />
<br />
By the way i'm actually writing a detailed desciption of Hotlist, it will be publihed within a new, debugged version. i've planned to upload it today but the description wasn't ready. I think i'll be able to do it till tomorrow ... anyway i hope you won't mind waiting 1 or 2 day longer... :D

Hotlist works with setup files. if they don't exists, it creates them - at least it was designed to do so. I'll do my best to kill that bug, but i'll need your support:<br />
<br />
- what version of windows do you use?<br />
- where are Hotlist and Windows located? (Full Path)<br />
- send me a screenshot of the error message <b>!very important</b><br />
- describe the error (when does it occcurs etc.)<br />
- hope that i get it fixed within 2 minutes :D<br />
<br />
i'm standing by and waitng for your bugreport mail...<br />
<br />
;) Magic

		<b>some new important improvements...</b><br />
<br />
I worked the whole weekend to finish them, now it's done!<br />
<br />
First, there's now a direct load option. It simply loads the selected hotlist, you won't have to click load, if you don't want to.<br />
<br />
Then, i added a Hotkey passing-through feature. That simply means, if you're working in VJ-Mode, every hokey you press will be directly passed to AVS (if running).<br />
It works with <b>all</b> hotkeys, even the next/prev track or return for toggling windowed/fullscreen mode. <br />
<br />
I tought that it isn't very usefull if you're doing a live set and suddenly you're pressing return by mistake... That's why i added a safety mode, that disables all non preset loading Hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Furthermore i added a feature that allows you to work completely without hotkeys. If you click an item in the detail view window, first the selcted Hotlist will be loaded (if it wasn't already) and then, the clicked preset wii be started.<br />
Unfortunately, it doesnt work with the shift+... hotkeys. You could keep on using them the old fashioned way, but i would recommend you to simply not use them - create another hotlist instead.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, i made Hotlist save your VJ-Mode settings. If you have been using older versions of hotlist already please open the hotlist.set file in you Hotlist directory and add the following code on top of the file:<br />
<br />
Detail=off<br />
Pictures=on<br />
Size=small<br />
DirectLoad=off<br />
SafetyMode=on<br />
<br />
If you don't, it could cause Hotlist to crash o you're hotlists to be lost, maybe both.<br />
<br />
Here is the <a href="http://www.home.pages.at/ptcle/Downloads/Hotlist.zip" target="_blank">HOTLIST</a> download. <br />
<br />
I was'nt able to fix the bug, clang reported because i couldn't figure out what causes this bug - it's hard to find any bug that doesn't occur on your sytem. I will fix it as soon as i receive a detailed bugreport.<br />
<br />
enjoy the new features, Magic
