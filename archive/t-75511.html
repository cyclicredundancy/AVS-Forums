<div class="posttext">Ok, i've been playing with AVS for a couple of years on and off, but never really got into it until recently.<br />
<br />
here are some presets that i've made, some i've had lying around for ages, others i've just made recently<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Overall not really my bag, but I did like Discustipated Blue and Ty Cobb. <br />
<br />
I found some of them ran a bit slow (Blue Soup in particular), but most of the time I was getting around 20 fps which is acceptable. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some of them were a little ordinary, but blue soup, ty cobb, and disgustipated blue were awesome! I like how you used the beat. Tell me, why did you name the preset Ty Cobb?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, i had just finished making it, trying to think of a name that suited it, couldn't think of one, named it after the soundgarden song i was listening to at the time</div></div><hr />
