<div class="posttext">I have decided that there must be a really fast way of drawing this fractal in avs, even if it means learning APE programming I'm gonna make it render and zoom at real time. For the mean time though just thought I'd show you this, just 'cos I like it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dunno where I found this APE, but you'd like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Seen it. It sucks, it doesn't draw the mandelbrot set and it isn't very reactive or customisable in any music responsive way. I was thinking of making a zooming mandelbrot ape which uses the existing points known to speed up the render and can zoom in on multiple custom specified points to a custom specified level and uses a custom range of colours to colour the iteration. Once I get the hang of APE I should be able to do it, I made a C++ console program that did a zoomy set before so it shouldn't be to hard to do the same thing in an APE, although, I'll probably need to optimise it heavily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you could yourself shitloads of trouble if you zoomed in on a symettric point (x-axis, i guess) and just mirrored the top part<br />
<br />
but maybe thats just the lazy ass in me speaking out :)<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, the fractal looks cool (most of them do) and good luck w/ this project</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you zoom in on a point on the x-axis you will just get black or flat colour after a short while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry to burst your bubble, Jheriko, but you were late for the bus again.  Static, zooming, and morhping fractals have been done before (by AVS-King, UnConeD, me...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd October 2002, 19:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry to burst *your* bubble Atero but did you realise that technically those fractals are *very* easy to make since they use the same constant for every point? Julia fractals are of virtually no interest to me, you go and make a dynamic zooming mandelbrot set with your dynamic movement methods then come back and tell me how great your mandelbrot associated julia sets are?<br />
<br />
Besides have you actually seen any video/programs of zooming mandelbrot sets to specific points, they are amazing visually and technically compared to the aforementioned presets, that is why I wan't to make this fractal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's my two cents on the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2002, 16:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice two 'cents' there.<br />
<br />
Some cool coding but the set lacks a high enough level of precision to make it look right. Its just a shame that superscopes and dm's require to much processing to make it look right.<br />
<br />
Nice FPS they got though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2002, 23:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jheriko, read the comment. It's *your* code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2002, 23:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't read the comment on the dm one. :p<br />
<br />
That will teach me to assume things...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here is a page with a basic tutorial and a zooming mandelbrot demo: <br />

<div class="posttext">Yup, its a really bad mandelbrot APE. Totally unoptimised, totally static and totally unfinished.<br />
<br />
I'm going to keep coding this for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Karnov</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th October 2002, 05:11</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">mmmm....unoptimized<br />
<br />
<br />
well<br />
<br />
i can say one thing<br />
<br />
ITS FRICKIN FUNNY that a totally static AVS (i do realize its complex, and i couldnt make it in my wildest dreams) only runs at 13 FPS<br />
<br />
hehe<br />
looks cool tho, but being able to add manipulators to change it, somewhat, would be a good thing<br />
<br />
(damn, .ape's are fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th October 2002, 05:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Have a faster more dynamic mandelbrot set...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm not going to update this one too much untill its finished properly, this is just a taste of what it will be like. I'm currently working on making it do progressive zooming by calculation 128 iterations on the first frame then making it do the next 128 in stages whilst it zooms in. The attached one performs 128 iterations every frame, so if i'm spreading these out it will get much better framerates.<br />
<br />
Note this is totally unoptimised and unfinished. I think the finished one will probably have custom colors, a list of custom points to zoom in on, a random point picker and maybe some other cool features.<br />
<br />
Don't expect it soon though, this is my first ape project and I've still got some presets and other things on the go at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Have it zoom to...<br />
<br />
x=-0.577816-0.000000000931323-0.000000000116415;<br />
y=-0.631121-0.000000238419+0.0000000149012;<br />
<br />
And use some sort of table optimization as well. (If you're really smart, you can have it so you only need to recalc 3/4 of the next whole zoom factor. And also render it while you zoom, and prepare it in a buffer.)</div></div><hr />
