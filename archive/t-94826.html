      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D Spheres</strong><br />
      Is it possible to code this 3D Sphere in Winamp?<br />
      <br />
      It&#194;&#180;s coded my Ken Silverman [created Buildt engine]<br />

      <p class="post-content">I assume you mean "code in AVS" rather than "code in Winamp".<br />
      <br />
      It's easy, but the result is kind of boring... there are lots of more exciting things to do with it.<br />
      <br />
      Note that the sphere I generate is not exactly the same as in the program you specified: points are randomly distributed rather than equally spaced apart. The method I used for generating the unit vectors is rather messy too because I map a cube to a sphere: this results in clustering at the 8 corners (turn up the n value to make this more visible).<br />
      To prevent this, add<br />
      <br />
      red=if(below(x1,1),0,1);<br />
      <br />
      under the line<br />
      <br />
      x1=1/sqrt(sqr(px)+sqr(py)+sqr(pz));<br />
      <br />
      in the superscope's point code. This will generate a correct uniform random distribution (though you have less points).</p>

      <p class="post-content">thx<br />
      <br />
      maybe you have already coded so many exiting things you can&#194;&#180;t enjoy this nice simple sphere:D hehe I do;)</p>

      Since there's a sharing thing going on, I thought I'd share mine too. Thers were part of an idea that hasn't come to fruition. The never really worked to my satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the first one still looked quite spherish the second one was just a mess... like a figure eight or something? The first one was cool.<br />
      <br />
      PS I really love the sort of competition element here, makes everyone want to improve, and works!<br />
