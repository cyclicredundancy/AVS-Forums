<div class="posttext">Pretty cool guys! I'm becoming a fan of your work because the previous one you uploaded was really good as well. As for help with the fog thing, check out this version and tell me if it is what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hi peeps,<br />
<br />
&lt;jakeguy, nice idea.  cool horizon effect with the two planes sliding agiainst each other.  your original set has some nice moire effects from the warp in the plane.  funky.<br />
<br />
solamon, i like what you've done to blend some of the jagged edges, makes for a much cleaner image, however in reducing the number of spirals, it loses some of the nice moire i was talkin about. not bad, just different.  what it loses in extra dimensional effects it makes up for in clarity ( as a test i ran both presets without pixel doubling, but at 4 fps it just wasn't worth it, compared to 430x350 with doubling )<br />
<br />
you guys rock.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey solamon, thanks for taking the time to look at this stuff:D im glad you like our work....also thanks alot for the fog help it makes it look a ton less distorted....if me and underoath ever get enough to release a pack would it be alright if we used your remix? we will put the proper credit and everything?.....thanks alot for the good review loungerroom...hopefully we will have more for you guys to see in the near future.....thanks again......LeSsTHanjAKeguY</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sure. Feel free to use my remix. If you want to increase the number of spirals (as suggested by loungeroom), increase the number d is being divided by in the last dynamic movement. <br />
<br />
BTW, you don't have to give me credit if you understand how I added the fog and can reproduce it in other presets. Just a quick thanks for teaching you a new technique will suffice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok cool we will be useing that in our first pack when we are finished......i found the thing for the spirals out a couple of hours ago and sent it to underoath lol great minds think alike(i think it looks best at 30 but underoath likes it the way it is now so what do you think is best?).....also i thought the superscope was alittle basic so i made a picture to go with it that makes it totally disco lol...the picture is 162 kb uncompressed..but 1.3 kb compressed:D  so anyway here is the stuff hope ya like it too....see yah</div></div><hr />
