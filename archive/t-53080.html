      <p class="post-content">I have spent months working on avs presets for myself for fun and then I decided to make a site dedicated to AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Now I know some people like avs and some don't, but all I ask is for some support, just to make sure I'm doing good, but if I'm making crap avs's just tell me .....Its pointless for me to make so many...but then go to waste.<br />
      <br />
      I have had some support from Matt,bonj,dicktease,Psycho Puppet,scarface and the rest of the guys I know (thanks everyone).<br />
      <br />
      I bet some of you are wondering why I typed this....well I feel that my(so called)efforts are going to waste and that I could do better but need your help to get me back on track.<br />
      <br />
      I have managed to get a chat site up and the website is up but just let me know who actually go to my site please<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for your support and ideas.<br />

      </blockquote>I downloaded some and didn't like them much. It is true that you shouldn't make so many. Your effects, or AVS in general, is not varying enough to justify a very large quantity of presets.<br />
