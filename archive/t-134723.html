<div class="posttext">Thick lines in SSC's?<br />
i am never able to draw thick lines in ssc's, i always have to use texer.<br />
could someone help me out?<br />
[\edit] i know i should have posted this thread in avs trouble shooting forum but since it is here any way please help me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you mean like misc/set render mode, line width<br />
<br />
you just set it there to any number. and put the scope in after. only works on lnes, not dots.<br />
<br />
is that what you mean?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Or do you want solid scopes?<br />
<br />
A simple solid superscope analyzer<br />
<br />
Per frame<br />
n=w ; sz=0.3<br />
<br />
Per Pixel<br />
s=1-s ;<br />
x=i*2-1 ;<br />
y=s*sz-sz*0.5+getosc(i,0.1,0)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then put the Misc / set render mode above the scope and use line width 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
To make any scope &quot;solid&quot; try adding the value S somehow in your scopes, i recommend experimenting since i don't know exactly how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">tg:<br />
you should probably put the code<br />
i=if(s,i-1/n,i) <br />
in your code after the first perpoint line<br />
<br />
that way the values correspond properly and you need less 'n's to make the scope solid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">should be able to put line width in with the scope i think. Then you could set it to width instead of those silly x=0 movements. I wont even bother putting it in the wishlist though because it wont get added.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">s=-s kinda does the same thing, &amp; its a little easier to understand what it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th May 2003, 07:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">s=bnot(s) &amp; s=1-s are the same thing, i don't know which one is faster, i remember someone saying 1-s is faster instead of calling a function to do it...<br />
<br />
But honestly, i dunno :) I dunnot care that much :)<br />
<br />
Raz, you're talking about a solid fullscreen scope? Those x=0 movements combined with a scope are much faster than using a hella big solid scope...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th May 2003, 07:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">s=-s is pos/neg swith, you have to assign 's' in init, for egsample to 1. then it will switch from 1 to negative 1 every time the code is run.<br />
<br />
s=bnot(s) and s=1-s are boolean switches, they switch from 0 to 1 every time through, they dont need to be pre-assigned because 0 is default.<br />
<br />
a solid osciliscope (like the 'render/simple' one, as apposed to tuggs example) would be:<br />
<br />
s=bnot(s);<br />
i=(if,s,i-1/n,i);<br />
y=s*v*0.5;<br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
<br />
line width should be &gt;1<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; maybe it would be alot nicer if avs had a render/'dynamic-fill-space&quot; tool hehe-hoho-haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Tug: I think bnot is fastest, because it only accesses one constant/variable rather than two (though if the script library is smart, it'll use fld1 to get 1 instead of a memory fetch).<br />
<br />
Forget about the whole 'calling functions is slow' thing. It only applies when there is an actual clear mapping between the code you write and how the computer executes them, which doesn't go for a highlevel language like AVS.<br />
<br />
Heck, it doesn't even apply to C/C++ sometimes.<br />
<br />
Some people are so proud when they can exchange 2 variables using simple code like this:int a, b;<br />
a ^= b;<br />
b ^= a;<br />
a ^= b;<br />
<br />
But in fact, unless your compiler specifically recognizes that code (not likely), it'll be much slower than simply doing this:<br />
int a, b;<br />
register int c;<br />
c = a;<br />
a = b;<br />
b = c;<br />
<br />
Any decent compiler will turn that second piece of code into the most efficient piece of code possible for an x86.<br />
<br />
Plus there's the fact that an x86 doesn't support direct memory-to-memory copies, you always have to go through the cpu registers first (*), which is exactly what the second piece of code does.<br />
<br />
(*) I believe string ops like &quot;rep stos&quot; are exceptions to this, but they're only useful for big chunks afaik, not an int/float/....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i predicted s=bnot[s] is faster after the argument that y=x*x is slower than y=sqr[x] :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i really really dont think it matters whatsoever..<br />
<br />
eg, do you think one single bnot[var], or 1-[var] per point/pixel/frame is really going to make or break your preset.<br />
<br />
ucd, how the fuck do you know so much about compiler preference and assembly language efficiency blah blah blah..??</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tug i meant being able to set the line width to the width of the screen and there not being a limit to it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yes, ive heard he tutored Carmack everything he knows..<br />
not to mention bill fricken gates.<br />
I think. if memory servs, he invented windows..<br />

and the first computer.<br />

wow, i really milked that joke..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The set line width is buggy &amp; slow, why would anyone wanna use that instead of bnot(s) ? O_o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th May 2003, 12:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">because it can occasionally be slower, as it requires atleast twice as many n's as a normal scope. depending on the shape of your scope, you may need to use line width anyway to fill in the gaps. it depends on how you implement the switch variable anyway. As i said above.. withthe whole i=i-1/n stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th May 2003, 12:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, well both have their advantages, it's just a matter of taste. But if you don't already know then you should know that using line width to create big solid scopes won't work the same in all resolutions. When you use the S thing, it always looks the same in all resolutions, because it grows/shrinks depending on it. Line width stays always the same.<br />
<br />
Anyway, no more of this please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th May 2003, 10:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">there should be an option ot set the line width according to the width, height or both, eg line_width=w/100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th May 2003, 16:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well i think if there's a spacefilling/solidifying component in the next release, that won't be necessary.  but it would be nice, just in case</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">but s=1-s woudnt work if s=10 or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's because any non-init custom var starts out as 0, not 10 or something.<br />
<br />
Common sense, duh!<br />
<br />
As for Siddharta, on :<br />
i really really dont think it matters whatsoever.. <br />
<br />
eg, do you think one single bnot[var], or 1-[var] per point/pixel/frame is really going to make or break your preset. <br />
<br />

These small optimizing moments are pretty crucial because they're everywhere... You should be able to milk out a few extra FPS with optimization tricks. Besides, small things like this would matter on high-res DMs or high-n SSCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th May 2003, 10:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">and they do matter when you are having about 30 to 40 ssc's.<br />
i managed to increse fps by about 4 (?i dont exactly remember) when i optimized blue-spectrum by el-vis)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st May 2003, 07:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">shreyas, you can just do <br />
s=bnot(s); s2=10*s<br />
so it switches between 0 and 10 instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st May 2003, 16:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well, i know that. i just said that if initial value of s=10, then s would to -9 and then go on decreasing by 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd May 2003, 09:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">oh.. lovely. <br />
although that dont work for the bnot version.<br />
it would go 20,0,1,0,1 etc etc</div></div><hr />
