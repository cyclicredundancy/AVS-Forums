      It appears the main bottleneck in AVS's performance is actually the windows drawing routines! You can test this for yourself, place a window over the AVS window, so it's no longer updating the screen (but still getting processed). You'll get a FPS increase.<br />
      <br />
      Blank Preset: AVS Window visible ~145fps (peak 160fps) @ 320x240<br />
      Blank Preset: AVS Window hidden ~480fps (peak 500fps) @ 320x240<br />
      <br />
      Yes, this is a bad example, so I'll do another:<br />
      <br />
      ZAP4 - Into the night: AVS Window visible ~18fps (peak 19fps) @ 320x240<br />
      ZAP4 - Into the night: AVS Window hidden ~20fps (peak 21fps) @ 320x240<br />
      <br />
      ZAP3 - Fireworks: AVS Window visible ~34fps (peak 19fps) @ 320x240<br />
      ZAP3 - Fireworks: AVS Window hidden ~40fps (peak 40fps) @ 320x240<br />
      <br />
      Still not convinced?<br />
      <br />
      J6 - Glass Cube (weeee remix): AVS Window visible ~60fps (peak 61fps) @ 320x240<br />
      J6 - Glass Cube (weeee remix): AVS Window hidden ~85fps (peak 88fps) @ 320x240<br />
      <br />
      This means that perhaps AVS needs to use a better screen display method than what it currently uses. Most of these show the average draw time of 4ms, is this a bit slow in todays hardware accelerated era?</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is quite logical... explanation:<br />
      <br />
      AVS does all processing on the CPU, so the AVS image is kept in system memory. This is because video memory is only fast to the video card, but ultra-slow to everything else.<br />
      So when the image has been prepared it has to be sent to the videocard which takes up some resources.<br />
      <br />
      Note that there might also be some side-effects on Winamp's FPS counter because it is hidden.. i.e. it might not be exact.</p>
