Any comments or suggestions would be very useful.:)

		Sorry to &quot;shoot you down&quot;, but these are very very basic. Nothing really i haven't seen before a thousand times (and done myself also when i made my first :))<br />
<br />
Learning avs takes time. I suggest you try first to figure out the meaning of different components and blendings and such, before stepping into the next step of avs: code customized effects. Some say you should learn to code immediatly, but it's useless to know only one i think. You can't make good looking presets with code alone, and you can't make original stuff with the basic effects either.<br />
<br />
For help learning there are currently 2 tutorials available: Pir's <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=155977" target="_blank">AVS tutorial</a> and Atero's <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=147267" target="_blank">AVS Primer</a><br />
<br />
Both are very good tutorials as to avs's basic effects :)

You don't have to be sorry, we've all made these kind of presets before.
