      <p class="post-content">Sorry to "shoot you down", but these are very very basic. Nothing really i haven't seen before a thousand times (and done myself also when i made my first :))<br />

      Learning avs takes time. I suggest you try first to figure out the meaning of different components and blendings and such, before stepping into the next step of avs: code customized effects. Some say you should learn to code immediatly, but it's useless to know only one i think. You can't make good looking presets with code alone, and you can't make original stuff with the basic effects either.<br />
      <br />
      For help learning there are currently 2 tutorials available: Pir's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=155977" target="_blank">AVS tutorial</a> and Atero's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=147267" target="_blank">AVS Primer</a><br />
      <br />
      Both are very good tutorials as to avs's basic effects :)</p>
