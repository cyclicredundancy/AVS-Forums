my first attempt to do something 3D...<br />
my first post to this forum...

		there's only one reason of having 3 DM's working on the sphere: (the other 2 DM's are to render the sky and the floor). The problem is that you can use only one buffer for one DM, and I needed two different textures and two different sphere positions:<br />
- 1st DM: Sky<br />
- 2st DM: Floor<br />
- 3th DM: Transparency effect using the current buffer<br />
- 4th DM: Texture on the sphere<br />
- 5th DM: Reflection of the sphere on the floor using the same texture<br />
About the framerate, I'm sure it can be optimized. Currently it runs 23 fps on my pc (with pixel doubling).<br />
Maybe I can gain further speed by combining some DM's.<br />
You can safely remove the 5th DM which does the reflection.

		Woah this is really cool good job!<br />
<br />
Although I would suggest cutting down the number of DM's... personally I would leave out the 3rd DM and have the sphere solid, then remove the sky and replace it with a sync'd superscope or something to give the impression of space without the overhead of a DM.<br />
<br />
I'd consider some artistic changes as well since it is more of a technical demo at this stage than a visualisation.

I'll take PAK-9's advise and will try to bring in some artistic changes. You'll be hearing from me!

		Its very nice... why is the camera upside down when inside the sphere though? I think it looks much cooler from the outside perspective than the inside... nice to see a 'tech demo' as always. :)
