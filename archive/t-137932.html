      <p class="post-content"><strong>Overlay mode with alpha blending</strong><br />
      I hope this isn't a stupid question (probably is) but should i be able to alpha blend my overlay mode?<br />
      <br />
      I want my avs running in overlay mode and alpha blended, so that i can still see my wallpaper under the running avs.<br />
      <br />
      I have the cpu and video capabilities to do this, just wondering why it won't work.<br />
      <br />
      I'm running windows XP and winamp 3. I run the avs in overlay mode but with the alpha blending enabled it doesn't seem to do anything?<br />
      <br />
      I can alpha blend my skins/winamp etc plus adjust the opacity on my windowed avs's. it just doesn't want to do it in overlay mode.<br />
      <br />
      am i doing something or have i missed something?</p>

      <p class="post-content">first off, use the edit button instead of double-posting.<br />
      i'm pretty sure avs's alpha settings don't work this way...but i use 98se and alpha blending isn't available to me so i wouldn't know. stick it in the ever growing wishlist, hope someone will update it someday....</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alpha blending only works in windowed mode, because overlay is a hardware 'hack'. In overlay mode, a certain color (a key) is used for your desktop color, which is then replaced by the overlayed image by your videocard before the signal is sent to your monitor.<br />
      <br />
      To see how it works, take screenshot with overlay mode on, and look at it with overlay mode off. You will only see a solid desktop.</p>

      <p class="post-content">K, old thead y know but i will do post anyway, as i got the solution for him!<br />
      <br />
      Grab a IDE, and code just an empty form with a slider (for the alpha value) and a color selector.<br />
      <br />
      Than set the color of the form to a desired one, do the same with the overlay color. Activate overlay, but no setdesktoptocolor!<br />
      <br />
      Should work. (i think i got that by playing around long ago)<br />
      <br />
      If not, you need step by step frame grabbing and resizing but building an application is definately the way to go.</p>
