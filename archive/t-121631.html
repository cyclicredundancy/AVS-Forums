      The bugless (but slow) version of Fistfight. To those who don't like how it reacts, it's supposed to be for techno and rap music. I might've went overboard with the trippy factor tho ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice job Atero. Not much to complain about in this one. The only thing I don't like about it is the visibility of the screen edges after the DMs. Puts a sharp edge to this otherwise sleek preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I was using the d=-d strobe to cover that, since Channel Shift doesn't work smoothly like Color Map does (and I can't use Color Map cos it bugs).<br />
      The problem with fixing the smooth edges is that I'd have to up the grid size a lot, causing a major FPS drag (goes from about 26 to 15). Any other solution would be just as bad, as it'd involve linking the rotation and the zoom together (so that I don't get edges in the corners of the screen).</p>

      <br />
      I really like the colours you used in this preset the are subtly complementary. Nice knocking effect. Can only watch it for so long tho</p>
