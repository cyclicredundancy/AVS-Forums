<div class="posttext">Mmmkay- I understand I'd have to root the file to make it work, same as pictures... but I've see a whole lot of presets, and I can't say I've seen anyone use this render.<br />
I don't really know what format to use with this AVI. So.... um... someone tell... :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I guess AVI's are not used much because they're quite big. Also, why use AVI's when you can create an interactive ever changing video stream with AVS? I've seen some nice presets that use AVI's though.<br />
<br />
If you do use AVI's, I suggest you use the DivX 4 codec: it's the codec with the best size/quality now (divx.com). Make sure you include a clear one-click URL for people who don't have the codec.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">standar avi player of avi reali suck but i find this ape realy rock at http://www.forwind.net/pixelcorps/.<br />
It's stable and fast (i play 3 movie in same preset and run at 60 fps) and have a lot of features like beat and freq reverse movie , beat and freq random jump of movie, beat &amp; freq return at the start of movie, the control of alpha and speed and more. It take same time for load movie in ram it depends of leigth of movie (i personaly use clips from 1 to 10 sec) but you can force realtime. It have same bugs. it work fine on my pc with movie 320 x 240 cinepak and uncompressed. if you make cinepak movie don't use the option &quot;keyframe evry&quot; and don't limit datarate because if evryframe it's a single image it can jump easy to evry part of movie and don't have information when play reverse. don't use mpeg based compression like divx or xvid beacause they have intraframe predicted frame. I personaly play in windowed at resolution 332 x 256 in overlay mode in second screen.<br />
it have same bug about the resolution of winamp avs window and try to resize the window if you seem don't load the movie at 332*256 work to my pc perfect and always load all the movie. If you run at full screen it's better save preset and go fullscreen and reload it using y and u because it load in ram the movie at size of avs window and if you have the avi window bigger or smaller you will see the movies in fullscreen at the size of window.</div></div><hr />
