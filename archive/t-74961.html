      this isnt really a bug but its kinda interesting...<br />
      I'm using winxp pro, avs(any preset), and Photoshop 6.<br />
      This works for me but not a friend of mine (same setup machine).<br />
      <br />
      I run AVS in desktop overlay mode, causing desktop to animate (woooo!)<br />
      Then I open a 'find' window (start+f)<br />
      what do I see? the left pane of the find window animates...<br />
      I take a screenshot to show my friend the funky find window<br />
      paste it into photoshop only to find that it KEEPS ANIMATING<br />
      the SCREENSHOT keeps animating, I can modify it, and it keeps animating (now stretched out of proportions and cut up a bit) but IN photoshop the picture is animating! I found it kinda funny that it does this, probably referring to the same memory or something to get the source of the ss, but its cool ;)<br />
      <br />
      the screenshot, wherever its black, is where the avs overlays on it, its really funny...</p>

      The avs picture is still animating because you have turned on Overlay mode. Anywhere on screen, if the color is the one you selected in the overlay color in avs overlay options in winamp, that portion will be animated. The default color is black. If you open paint and you draw a black line or rectangle or something that rectangle will animate.:p<br />
      <br />
      Here's another bug :<br />
      If you turn on overlay mode and you enter ms-dos mode in fullscreen, when you will turn back in windows the avs is stopped, it's just back.:)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yeah!</strong><br />
      Dude,<br />
      <br />
      When you have overlay mode on, it overlays onto anything that is the selected color. It's not really animating in photoshop, it's just overlaying it onto the screenshot you took that has the overlay color in it.<br />
      <br />
      Your friend probably has different colors selected...<br />
      <br />
      A few fun things to try now that you know this:<br />
      <br />
      You can change the colors of your desktop and windows so that the overlay will show up wherever you want it. I have mine appearing in the title bars, scroll bars and outlines of any window. It gives it that extra punch when you show your buddies.<br />
      <br />
      Overlay mode really is a great feature though (although I've noticed you can't minimise winamp while using it or AVS shuts down).. thanks to overlay, I can display the AVS window on my TV and second monitor using my PCI ATI Mach64 tv-out, AND have it overlayed onto my desktop.</p>
