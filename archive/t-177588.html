<div class="posttext">my latest two presets, i think these two are a bit better than the previous one's, comments welcome (obviously), but if you're not going to give any reason or make a valid point in any way whatsoever then please tell me in advance so i can not waste my time reading you're post ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tips for the &quot;inverse color dots&quot;: The effect list does nothing, you can delete that (effect list suck up fps even if they don't contain anything) Why it does nothing? Well it doesn't contain anything that is one thing, but another is that it's first on the list so the other effects you have don't affect it since you also have &quot;clear every frame&quot; checked (click &quot;main&quot; to see it)<br />
<br />
Another tip: this is a bit tricky, but you can actually combine the two movements into one. Just copy the code d = d * (0.94 + (cos((r-$PI*0.5) * 32.0) * 0.06)); from the movement above and paste it into the below one before the r = cos(r * 3) and then delete the movement from which you copied the code. So the final would look like: d = d * (0.94 + (cos((r-$PI*0.5) * 32.0) * 0.06));r = cos(r * 3) doing this will boost the fps from 30~ into 37~ with this system (800mhz pentium 200x200 window size) :)<br />
<br />
btw. it might not be so wise to post everything here, just play around with avs for a while (1-3 months) &amp; learn new things and then try to make something worth-a-while to look at :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">about the combining the movement's, your suggestion does work well, but it seems to take the sunburst movement off of the larger moving particle and kind of orients it in the middle instead of it 'sticking' to the particle (see attached preset)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just uncheck the &quot;Blend&quot; box on the movement ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmmmm.... <br />
that is pretty badass, but ya don't like it the other way also?<br />
i do see you're point though, the smaller particle is doing a lot more and they don't get so constricted towards the center</div></div><hr />
