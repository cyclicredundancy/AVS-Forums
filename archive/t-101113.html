		That's pretty nice. I'd try and get the background to stobe with the beat though.

		Sweet colors...I wouldn't strobe it though.  I think you should have a background that's either white or black (white'd be better, I'm tired of black presets :P), but not gray...gray's kinda blah. *hides in case he's insulting montana's taste yet again*<br />
<br />
Attached a remix that clips the gray areas out.  Only problem it presents is when the scopes get gray...but since the likelyhood one of them will is 256^-3, or approx 0.000,000,059, and that IF one goes off, it's probably not going to be noticed, I don't think it's that much of a concern :P

		I dunno...I think that a preset that responds quicker is better...although sometimes a slower processor is needed for full effects...(The Landscape is killing me)

		You forget about UnConeD, Duo, S_KuPeRS...me...all people who make very good (hopefully good, in my case) presets that aren't fast at all.  That's the problem with going for speed - you cut corners that you really shouldn't cut.  *cough* 16x16 *cough* ;)

		Dude, calm down...I'm just saying that speed isn't always the thing you want to go for, especially if it makes the preset look ugly - the only thing I was talking about was when you were using a low gridsize that looked really bad.  I was just using that as an example.<br />
<br />
But we digress.  What do you think of making the background black or white?<br />
And was my preset a total insult to your artistic vision(s)? :P

		no, it wasn't a insult, stuart, i felt your remix was a disapointment, it wasn't fully a remix, it was more a edit,

		I didn't mean it to be.  It was mainly a color remix, not a rendering remix...I was thinking about feedbacking it (probably putting the whole thing in an effect list, setting it to output: maxblend and input: adjustable blend 25%, then blitter feedback on the outside :D) but I thought it would take away from the preset and didn't try it.

		Atero, here's a proper way to remix :p (attached)<br />
<br />
I think there are 3 levels of remixing... Edit (only edits), Mix (Some edits, some additions), Remix (a lot of changes, a lot of difference in looks)...<br />
<br />
Anyways, enjoy the mix.

		LOL, never tell me I'm dissapointing ;) I was nice this time and only did one, if it wasn't late at night I would've done about seven, then kept going on :P<br />
<br />
And ya never know, I could even make something better than the original :D

		That depends.  For instance, take a normal C chord.  Modify it to a Cb1-3add9add11, making it a G7 chord.  So if you like dominant sevenths better than 'vanilla' chords, the modified version is better.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Seriously tho, there's several ways to make the 'original' spiral ssc supplied with AVS more dynamic and, therefore, better...that's just one example.  There's probably ways to modify UnConeD's Water Cube to make it look or work better (without sacrificing the looks or speed), too ;)
