      <p class="post-content">Default scopes with a very slight change (one number) and a couple of built in effects are not really remixable. Please code your own preset scopes from scratch. By all means learn from the default scopes, what each effect does, etc but do not try and pass them off as something you achieved.<br />
      <br />
      If you'd used them to learn about things and made your own mixed up effects with them and actually tried instead of selecting one, changing a couple of numbers and submitting it so people can remix it because you can't even be bothered to finish a preset you didn't start then i wouldn't have rambled on like this.<br />
      <br />
      Not to be insulting or spiteful or to discourage you but to motivate you to try harder than this. Come on man, experiment with different effects, try things out.</p>
