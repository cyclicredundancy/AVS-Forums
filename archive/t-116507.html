		<a href="http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=124571" target="_blank">This is a page with it.</a> Previous release had good success. Dont' look at envy messages there. Download and have fun. To make this properly working AVS window must be set to double size as default main WinAmp window. Another way - open AVS code window to see sizes and then resize AVS window to 540x200. This preset doesnt' have low res bitmaps and modes. If you use low res - you have download previous. If you already have previous - just install new over it.

		I want the classic Winamp2 Fire spectrum style with one bar per pixel horizontally rather than the ugly-ugly-ugly spectrum bars in WA3. Never got used to those ugly bars.

Amen!<br />
<br />
Why don't you use WA2 again ?<br />

		Agreed to UnConeD - WA2 had very good fire-looking built-in spectrum analyzer. I preffered it. Even I like old vis_satan (Sexy Attached Analyzers) spectrum analyzer. It represented spectrum as fire behind water. Very good looking with lots of tunes. I run it in WA3 using Classic Vis plugin. But it has several big lacks - AVS 2.5 window can't be attached to WA3. It even can't be minimized - therefore when I run it in overlay mode - AVS 2.5 window always remains on top. And WA3 doesnt' save it's sizes.<br />
<br />
But how it all relates to VU-meters? <br />
<br />
I think sometimes about writing a preset looking as vis_satan. As you can see - in VapourMachine there is small window with dancing flame. May be large preset will appear later.
