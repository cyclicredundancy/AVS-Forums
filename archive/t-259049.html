      <p class="post-content"><strong>Remixing</strong><br />
      Hello there, I was wondering what the "policy" might be on remixing someone else's AVS presets and then releasing a pack of those. I don't get much time to code so I fiddle with others stuff while I am at work once in awhile and usually come up with some pretty cool stuff. If I were to give credit where due would there be any problems with me releasing a remix pack of presets?</p>

      <p class="post-content">People release remix packs fairly often, so no there is no problem with it.<br />
      <br />
      For naming it is conventional to use the original preset name followed by the name of the remix and who it is by in brackets. Most people request that you include the original preset comment with the remix and it is generally polite to do so.<br />
      <br />
      Those are just guidelines and generally accepted practice however, you may want to contact the preset authors directly if you are particularily concerned.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To be safe read the comments in the packs. Mostly people put something like "feel free to use portions of this preset as long as I receive credit" in their preset comment etc.</p>
