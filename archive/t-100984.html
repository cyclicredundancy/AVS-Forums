<div class="posttext">Just thought I'd post a message up here to see if anyone could download my avs packs and tell me what they think, some of them are quite small (smallest 45k, biggest 520k). They're over at deskmod(where they got staff rated at 84, 84, 82, 81) and i'll put some links at the bottom of this message. <br />
<br />
The reason there are so many all at once is because:<br />
<br />
1.)the first one contains mainly presets i made over a year ago, the last one contains presets I finished last week, so they are spread out in age.<br />
2.)i rarely used to get a chance to upload stuff and use the internet - now i have broadband (finally after almost a year of practically no internet usage...)<br />
3.)they take time to review them here at winamp.com (thats not a bad thing tho' plz don't see this as a complaint in anyway, i'm just impatient)<br />
<br />
If you do decide to check them out could you please post a response here and don't be afraid to tell me which presets look like dog poo and which ones look like the dogs er..., well, which ones look really great.<br />
<br />
Thanx in advance<br />
<br />
Here are those links i promised:<br />
<br />
JHERiKO - RePack 1 - The Atonement (http://www.deskmod.com/core.mod?state=view&amp;skin_id=15008) <br />
JHERiKO - Pack II - The Geometry of Light (http://www.deskmod.com/core.mod?state=view&amp;skin_id=15009) <br />
JHERiKO - Pack III - Redemption (http://www.deskmod.com/core.mod?state=view&amp;skin_id=15011) <br />
JHERiKO - Pack IV - Clarity of Vision (http://www.deskmod.com/core.mod?state=view&amp;skin_id=15012) <br />

<div class="posttext">:eek: Do'H!<br />
<br />
Hey jheriko, if you want to top that, you have to make more stuff than him...  I am trying to get close to him myself...Look at my megapak2.0 to see what I've been doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i am learning at a really high pace, being half through a maths degree and having programmed opengl for c++ for over a year now helped a lot, i've been programming for more than ten years now (i made my first qbasic program at age 8 it was a string encrypter/decrypter) hopefully i should be able to compete soon. I really just need to sit down and plan a good preset, i know the theory i just have to put it into practice.<br />
<br />
i'll go look for that megapack right now...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">He posted them in the forum. I'll check your packs in a bit, no time right now. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you really should check them out if you get a chance, some of them are insanely good some are really technical as well. I would download them especially pack iv it has tons of new 3d superscopes and DM's and I haven't stolen any code either, I've done some things that others have done using different methods altogether. <br />
<br />
I could be biased towards my own packs, but I'd put some of those presets up there with the best...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th August 2002, 06:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I took a quick look. I am impressed. I haven't done a good 3D DM yet (unless you count moving kalidescope in my pack, but I don't). I have a couple of nice 3d scopes, but that haven't been released yet.<br />
<br />
I do like your packs. :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th August 2002, 14:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thx. speaking of 3d scopes, i'm working on an avs version of my avatar...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I had a look.<br />
<br />
I think i even kept a few.<br />
<br />
Your smoke effects are pretty cool and i like your landscape images. I'm probably gonna do something similar in my next release (with my own spin, of course).<br />
<br />
It might be cool if you found some way generate those clouds without using a picture. Or this might reduce the fps too much.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, you should work on doing more with less. I haven't looked too closely but in some presets you seem to use too many components to achieve an effect.<br />
<br />
All in all, i like it but if they were mine i'd work them a but more before releasing them.</div></div><hr />
