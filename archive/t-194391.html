      <p class="post-content"><strong>Maths Problem</strong><br />
      If you have completely different numbers (like in my case 16, 17, 25, 26, 31, 51,), how do you change a variable (on random or sequential) between just these integer numbers?<br />
      <br />
      If the numbers were for example 5,10,15,20, it would be very easy (something like: var = var + 5 * rand(3) set onBeat will be enough).<br />
      <br />
      But in this case.... aaRgh... How do I skip all these unregular "gaps"?<br />
      <br />
      I hope someone can help me solving my little math-riddle...<br />
      <br />
      Thank you!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd use something like:<br />
      <br />
      3 'random' numbers: 3,9,5<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br /><b>var=rand(3);</b><br />//where 3 is the amount of variables<br /><br /><b>var1=equal(var,0)*3+equal(var,1)*9+equal(var,2)*5;</b><br />//extend to how much is needed. Quite fast.<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      Of course you can use variables instead of constants too.

      <p class="post-content">I'm sorry but that solution is manky icky and horrible...<br />
      <br />
      use the megabuffer inniiiit, say you have 5 numbers you want to change between<br />
      <br />
      init:<br />
      <br />
      assign(megabuf[0],1);<br />
      assign(megabuf[1],3);<br />
      assign(megabuf[2],6);<br />
      assign(megabuf[3],7);<br />
      assign(megabuf[4],11);<br />
      <br />
      then when you need the number:<br />
      <br />
      currentval=megabuf[index];<br />
      <br />
      cycling sequentially:<br />
      <br />
      index=(index+1)%5;<br />
      <br />
      ....randomly:<br />
      <br />
      index=rand(5);<br />
      <br />
      my syntax might be a bit wrong (I'm not in front of winamp) but you get the idea.</p>

      <p class="post-content">megabuf the way the to go.<br />
      You can use it to easily make and change what numbers you want it to put out and you can easily make it global using gmegabuf.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This sounds good too! The point, that gmegabuf can be globaly used in the whole presets also brings an advantage.<br />
      But the use of the megabuf ends up in a slightly bigger expression. And indeed warrior's term does give me the solution i need. The ssc i used it with works the way i wanted it to. So why is it an advantage to use the megabuf, when avs-code should be as short as possible?<br />
      <br />
      Have a look at what i used it for:<br />

      <p class="post-content">AVS code is not ment to be as short as possible, but as <i>fast</i> as possible and from what i've hear megabuf (or the g version of it) is faster to use than what regular AVS means prior to 2.7.<br />
      <br />
      But what would i know, i don't use megabuf because i can't understand that shitznazz :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't really know faster or not, but it would probably require more lines of code to input the variables. Since you just want the output numbers to be static, you can have them be set on init, so that shouldn't be a fps problem. Once you get into the actual preset it should be close enough to the same fps that you couldnt tell a difference, in fact, megabuf might even be a hair faster, becuase both methods are doing basically the same way to get the random number, one just uses the megabuf to load the values while the other uses a multiplier, so theoretically, the megabuf one should be faster because it has less operations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think, i agree with tuggummi: use the kind of code you understand! On one hand the meagbuf thing seems to be not that difficult, but on the other I completely understand the math behind the first code thing. Also, if it's not a big difference in fps, it will be a decision of favour... ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">var=1;<br />
      result=equal(var,index)*number;<br />

      is slower than<br />
      <br />
      var=1;<br />
      result=gmegabuf[var];<br />
      <br />
      because you have at least 1 equal and a multiplication. Furthermore the previous method gets linearly slower the more numbers you have to pick from. My method<font size="1">tm</font> does not get any slower even with a million numbers because they are cached into the (g)megabuf on init.<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm just about understanding the point with speed: it's a question of how many calculations avs has to make; the more the slower it gets. on the opposite you can write an essay about your last holidays and use it as an variable (as long as you don't use spaces) for example.<br />
      However you write the code in this example, there will probably always be another way to do. Thats the point why we all love avs, isnt't it? The only limitation is your imagination (and fps, of course.. ;))</p>

      </blockquote>Hmm, not quite. Any variable longer than 8 letters will be discarded. This means that you can still write long variables yes, but longcode1 is the exact same as longcode2 since it doesn't count anything beyond the letter 'e' which is the 8th letter in both of them.<br />

      </blockquote>Well actually you could cache the variable name into the megabuf on init using acsii codes and a control character to represent the termination of the variable name. Then reference the first item of the variable name, add up the codes that make the variable name and apply a hashing algorithm to turn it into a unique number representing a point in the megabuffer where the variable is stored (probably 1,000,000 minus the result to avoid conflict with the variable names). Simple really.<br />

      If i use your method to name a variable or anything else after my essay about last holidays, i will be able to use spaces and all other characters. But is your method capable to format my cute little story in paragraphs and so on? How would you do that, hm? ;)

      <p class="post-content">Oh thats simple you just take a formatting standard or a file structure. You could use the rich text format which uses a series of control characters for example. However if it was me I'd go for a standard like html, where you would brace formatting characters like [b], it would require 3 or more megabuf elements per control character which is quite expensive; however the html format would let you define all sorts a zany variable names, like web pages with text and pictures :D :D :D</p>
