      <p class="post-content">I'm really sorry that got stuck in there:( I mean I didn't do it but I feel bad anyway. The thread is not silly, and I think you two are just joking around with each other, and it's kind of funny(made me laugh anyway), I thought this thread was well, semi-dead. Like no new posts untill The_King_Pin decided to release a new version(btw I really like this version:)).<br />
      <br />
      I think Matt must have read where Atero said that the ranking of 'Major Dude' has nothing to do with skill, and everything to do with the number of posts you make:( This is the second time he's gone a grave diggin' today, and not to add anything constructive, or even make a complimentary comment, but just for the sake of getting in a post. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starting to get really annoyed. Tuggummi(Tugg to his friends, I just got here) said to ignore him. Ignoring him doesn't seem to work. Since here in the U.S. Thanksgiving just came and went, I suggest seating him at the kiddie table ASAP. The kid needs to take his Ritalin and start behaving himself like the good boy he thinks he is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">it's definitively NOT silly what we were talking about. in all honesty it's a pitty that you don't know the IAPCPA. I should probably tell them about this one, so that they'll pay you a short (and probably painful) visit.<br />
      So please keep calm and stay inconspicuous around here, o.k?<br />
