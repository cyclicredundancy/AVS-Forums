			<strong>What the hell?</strong><br />
		
		

		I was in the middle of one of my best avs creations when I tried to add a channel shift and winamp crashed. First I thought it was just that time, but after I started to do some presets again I saw that it crashes when I try to add the channel shitf.<br />
<br />
What the hell is wrong with it? I tried reinstalling winamp and it didn't work so I was wondering if I was the only one with that problem. If not can I get some help?<br />
<br />
Best regardz Florin.

		Try removing the channelshift.ape from your AVS folder (if you have one), because channel shift was integrated within AVS some time ago having a separate channelshift.ape file in your AVS folder can cause some problems, you're certainly not the first one to experience this problem.

		Yes, i did that when I got that problem, but i had it with more than just the &quot;Channel Shift.&quot;<br />
I had it with:<br />
Channel Shift<br />
Multiplier<br />
Color Reduction<br />
Video Delay<br />
And i think that's pretty much all.<br />
Thank you
