      <p class="post-content">yeah I wouldn't worry bout only being 14, a lot of the folks making some really kick a$$ presets are younger. And as for the math side of AVS... you could always get help from your math teacher, copy the code from a superscope, and take it to school. They love that stuff. I guess it shows them what they're teaching really has something to do with the world outside the classroom.<br />
      Keep it up.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, here's a pack of pre-made scopes. It'll help you get started.<br />
      Always make sure you give credit to the folks that made them. In this case the credit goes to <a href="mailto:Pmog@bigfoot.com">Pmog@bigfoot.com</a>.<br />
      Also make sure you ask before posting a preset with other folks DMs,movements, and so on. They always say yes, most just want a copy of the preset you've made, and credit in the misc/comment.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So what if you're 14? I'm 13 and I can morph superscopes...and I haven't even been using AVS for a year. The math really isn't that hard, all you need is an elementary grasp of any programming language, then you need to learn the AVS language (which isn't really hard). And as I've said before, I'm willing to help anyone, as long as they ask ;)<br />
