      <p class="post-content"><strong>avs for artwork</strong><br />
      have read some of the forums, need some confirmation, i'm an multimedias artist, painter, composer, writer blah blah, have composed some of my own music, written words etc, and will create my own avs presets using tutorials and nullsoft, then would like to use them as a layer in another multimedia artwork piece that i am creating,<br />
      <br />
      so if i have created the avs components, are there any copyright issues?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      am working towards art installation piece for gallery or exhibition, usually struggling artist story,..<br />
      <br />
      finally i would give credits to nullsoft winamp program.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just as long as you don't use the work of another artist you should be fine. ie. use components from any other avs preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks for the responses. I have downloaded a large tutorial on the program, that is how to make presets with explanations of the maths etc, so will create my own from scratch and probably create some images in photoshop , etc and tweak them , then drop them in, ... I would not copy anyone else's. I understand how important it is to respect someone else's creative work. That really brings up another discussion about what is original. ideas of how we are all ultimately influenced in some way by other works... i'm especially interested in experimenting with fractal geometry and fibicinni's spirals etc all found in nature, which we all ultimately copy either consciously or unconsciously.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sounds interesting. Just a warning tho, fractals and spirals generally make poor avs presets. Fractals are especially troublesome to render in AVS at interactive rates without them looking like total poo. Almost all of the fractal presets around rely on piles and piles of hax to work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks for the advise about the fractals, perhaps simplicity is better, less distracting in design. especially if the music is complex, makes a nice contrast.<br />
      <br />
      sometimes we can get carried away with what's possible without stepping back from it and asking why.<br />
      <br />
      appreciate your responses.</p>

      This deals with the plugin itself but still might be useful.</p>
