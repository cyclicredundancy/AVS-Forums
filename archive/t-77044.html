      MMMkay, this is the 3rd preset I've posted. *sigh* and I'm just going to have to keep posting them.<br />
      Once again, tell me what you think. Ya know I like to think I'm doing good at this avs stuff as far as newbies go.<br />
      and if you look at this one, go look at my other two posted presets, you're already in the right place what can it hurt? (besides your eyes):rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Matter O fact, I'd like to see some people change this one a bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">K... Not bad, needs something though. Maybe just a scope infront of it. For me it's not varied enough to be just that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not bad, once you move the superscope down in the list so you can see it. I still thou it needed somethinf a little more happeneing withthe scope though, so I messed with it abit.<br />
      <br />
      I liked the text, the only problem was that when the DM was on you couldn't read it. :( I pushed it down the list to just above the superscope (which I also pushed down), but it just didn't look as cool. I thought a smoke effect a la smokin' kalidoscope (see Whacko AVS II), so I came up with one that probably slows it down a lot more than necessary. :p I still didn't seem trippy enough though, so I set the DMs effect list to always on (tweaked the DM a bit too, so it didn't zoom out as far), and added a colourfade to the smoke.<br />
      <br />
      End result. :D :up: :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey I like it! I can see what you mean by not trippy enough.<br />
      love the remix though. Yeah I've seen all of UnConeDs stuff (well the posted stuff). All Hail UnConeD.<br />
      I'll make sure the next preset I post is up to par.<br />
      Thanks for the feedback-</p>

      <p class="post-content">Np... keep posting you presets though, constructive criticism only helps.<br />
      <br />
      By the by; would you mind (if I ever get off my ass and do anything about it) if I include this in a pack?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah you can put it in a pack, make sure you keep the misc/comment in there though, since the scope was made by UnConeD.<br />
      I think the DM needs some work though, I'll see what I can come up. The current one breaks up the liquid effect a bit too much, which is why I had it set for 10-15 frames. In that short of a time it couldn't bunch up into little blobs.<br />
      <br />
      Here's a DM that has more of a rolling liquid feel to it. I'm not all that great at these darn things yet so this DM needs some touch up, it squares off too much. well you'll see...<br />
