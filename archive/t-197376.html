			<strong>FPS adjustment for each preset</strong><br />
		
		

		Looking at some older presets, you might experience some perfomance problems: Older presets are often too fast for modern CPUs. Then you might adjust the fps within the avs options, but that has to be done for each single preset. So my idea is to create the possibility of saving fps limit information in the presets itself. Thus, your presets will look the same way on different computers.

		Let me just jump in before Tugg...<br />
<br />
You can do this yourself in code, by using gettime(), so that movements are frame rate independant. It doesnt apply to 'moving particles' and other crappy codeless AVS elements...but you shouldn't be using them anyway ;)

		Oh PAK-9, you totally jumped the gun on this one, see if im right (which i am of course) he isn't looking a solution for making presets, instead he wants to view the old presets he already has with a little lesser framerate and also wants to save those fps settings for them.<br />
<br />
There has been much discussion about a framerate limiter APE, but so far no one has done that yet.<br />
<br />
So sorry, there isn't any other solution to this right now than to stick with the performance slider.

		Rectification: The slider doesn't have to be set per preset, it should stay as you have set it. <br />
(Stored on HDD when Winamp closes if I'm right... not sure about that)

			<strong>here it is</strong><br />
		
		

		I just compiled such an ape, I think it is really usefull for &quot;oldschool&quot; presets that run too fast with nowadays CPUs.<br />
<br />

		Another idea: I think, it would be very useful to have the Limiter in &quot;Main&quot;, right under &quot;clear every frame&quot;, with an enabling option, so that people don't have to download the APE.

		May not be possible ... I say &quot;May&quot; coz' I know someone made an APE capable of resizing AVS editor window without having to add the APE to each preset so it also &quot;may&quot; be possible ... I promise I'll have a look :)
