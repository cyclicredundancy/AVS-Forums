      allright i got to speak about avs..it's a while i use it and...yep .....still the same prob....<br />
      <br />
      the list mode/mayby the playlisting stuff..almost the way to switch a preet to another without pressing y or u to go back and forth..h&#195;&#169;h&#195;&#169;<br />
      <br />
      also when you load a preset ffrom hotkeys if you press y or u it goes straight back to the start/end..then it shall better go to the following presetname<br />
      <br />
      also there is the prob that it is only sorting by date and not by name so you can't make a code slideshow (starts with a.avs , finish with z.avs and then next comes aa.avs next zz.avs)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      then about the preset/hotkeys and loading stuff stuff<br />
      i got some ideas soluces..<br />
      <br />
      first..mayby a bit expention<br />
      <br />
      there could be a hotkeys preset loader (like the arrows or the right side num keyboard)<br />
      <br />
      so it could be possible to load a range of about 25-40 presets loaders<br />
      list ..then press an arrow and get another list with diferent presets/order<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      or mayby another one..<br />
      d=next5 e=next8 f=next12 g=back12 h=back8 j=back5<br />
      <br />
      (ok i use a french canadian keyboard so there may be some differance through)<br />
      <br />
      this in a name classified list<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      now lets talk about bigscope/movement/...<br />
      <br />
      there must be a mathematical's preset loader cause i'm kinda tired to copy the commands in notepad..<br />
      <br />
      mayby it coulds load from txt files..i dunno..but it's still a great move to do<br />
      <br />
      also the rest of this is almost well made<br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      transparency<br />
      now about avi/picture loader.........and mayby colorclip<br />
      <br />
      there should be transparence withins it..by clicking a wanted color's code (like #256-223-4)i don't realy remember how those codes are writen..and i don't wana goes taking a look trough it<br />
      <br />
      ok and also about colorclip command make color transparent should be added..<br />
      <br />
      (the matter withins those is that it'd be great to use rotto blit/water behind something else)<br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      angle/position.........and perhaps effect list....<br />
      <br />
      ok when you add an effect list you just can't put nothing in it if it's empty..h&#195;&#169;h&#195;&#169;..so it'd better autoadd an empty effect like "empty"<br />
      <br />
      angle to makes the page flip on landscape mode or on 4 walls mode ot whatever..<br />
      a spheremaker could be great too..<br />
      <br />
      position to get the thing you want to the upper left to the upper left without being breaking the rest of the fx<br />
      <br />
      also a screensize adjuster with a limit of 48x or 200x or something like that..<br />
      <br />
      to makes the desized angle being a maze of squares or rectangles<br />
      <br />
