      <p class="post-content">some of them are a bit too empty. Mostly the ones with just scopes. They need something in the background.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, some of them are definetly empty looking and need more effects and/or bigger scopes. But overall some nice stuff here, i especially liked the 3D tunnel, it made me realize why the hell i didn't use colorcode in my tunnel scope ("so i fell" in strobotonic II) to make it "move" forward :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Nice, decent stuff :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Which are empty? Just wondering, do you like the intro? I changed it a lot before I thought of using the skulls.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a quick question about the DM. Is there any set variables to use in it? I know r, d do something and x is x and y is y. Because i noticed people using, seemingly, any letter they want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You just missed b Limpet. But this should be in another thread, or not mentioned at all because is has been mentionsed before. Do a search back far enough and you'll find it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I liked Strange colours. It's simple, but colourful. Adding some kind of move black hole would be cool, and could give some musinc responce.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, a good exaple of an empty preset would be rings.</p>

      </blockquote>That one is fairly empty. I am not sure why I included it.
