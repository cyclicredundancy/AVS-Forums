<div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
I'm currently in need of an AVS Preset that looks somehow like these   3 images I've posted here:<br />
<br />
look here (http://www.romanklein.com/avs.html)<br />
<br />
It should simply be a matrix of black dots growing or shrinking according to the music and changing area around a kind of center.<br />
<br />
If there's no sound it should be blank white, if it gets very loud it should almost be black allover.<br />
<br />
I don't know if there's an AVS that comes close to this. I haven't found one yet - so if anybody knows one it would be very nice to let me know.<br />
<br />
If there's none I'd be very thankful if someone would like to build it :)... I guess it ain't very difficult if you have some experience in building AVS. Sadly I got none. But if you tell me that I could reach this result in one days  work as a newby I'll maybe give it a try.<br />
<br />
thanks alot for any advice,<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I'm Working on it now......<br />
If you want to try it yourself. Change the colour code in this to something by deleting the whole thing, and adding something like. red= getspec(d,0,0);green=red;blue=red;<br />
sizex=w/iw*red*0.1;sizey=h/ih*red*0.1;<br />
It doesn't look that good, but it's a start....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Like this? It's basically AVS within AVS though. Has a trans/movement, render/superscope plus a per pixel renderer.<br />
<br />
I've marked them with *!* in a comment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whoops, I should add my attachment</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Unconed... That is great! Don't worry about mine sun</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hey wow thanks!<br />
I haven't expected an answer that fast!<br />
I'm in hurry right now, but I'm gonna check them later today...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">There's a glitch unconed... If you enlarge the screen/go fullscreen, and shrink it again, the dots go fullsize and don't change.<br />
But It's great for how little time it took to make *most likely 20min?*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th January 2005, 21:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah there's a bug with the buffer flipping. Replace the &quot;buffer flip&quot; line and the line after it in the texer 2 per frame with:<br />
<br />
/* buffer flip */<br />
ip=1-ip;bf1=n*ip;bf2=n*(1-ip);reg05=bf2;<br />
<br />
Also, for more blackness, change the scale line to:<br />
<br />
scale=if(mode,1,min(1.6,max(0,4*sqrt(scale))));<br />
<br />
Took me about an hour, though most of that was tweaking the visuals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Also looks cool if you change the movement line to<br />
x=atan(x);y=atan(y)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PJ-Avser</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th January 2005, 02:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">or it looks cool with<br />
dx=sin(x)*0.99;dy=sin(y)*0.99;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">underwatersun</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th January 2005, 17:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thank you both very much!<br />
<br />
The dotthing-visual really comes close to what I'm looking for...I especially love the waving borders when the sound is at low volume. That's perfect! I've written you a mail about it, unconed... I hope you don't mind!<br />
<br />
If anyone really feels like spending some more time on it, it would be nice to make the visual way slower, more dense around the center, lighter at the borders, the dots fading slower and the movement more plasma- or magma-like... that would be perfect!<br />
<br />
The dots should only reach the borders if it really gets loud and really be blank white then the sound is off.<br />
<br />
And as it should work as a mask for a video it really would be great if there would appear some kind of larger black areas around the center, where the dots are melting together...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for that bunch of details.<br />
Critizizing something you get for free ain't that fair.<br />
But I've tried some changes by myself and it didn't work out...<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I just made some changes to unconeds code. I hope this iswhat you mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">underwatersun</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th January 2005, 23:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks alot pj! It's getting closer :)<br />
<br />
Is it possible to let the little white dots disappear, which remain inbetween the black spaces?<br />
A little smoother fadeout of the dots and some more black area would be great too...<br />
<br />
Although I don't really understand the avs code i played around a little bit and reached a version which is quite perfect concerning dot- and blackspace-behavior.<br />
<br />
Only the basic-type of movement and the fact that it still keeps playing when the music's over make it somehow useless.<br />
<br />
It looks nice while it keeps small... but as the sound gets loud it gets to blownup.<br />
<br />
It would be quite interesting to combine that kind of dot- and blackspace-behavior with a basic movement like seen in Unconeds &quot;Rainbow Ball&quot; of the finalwhack-set. If something like that is possible.<br />
<br />
I'll keep on trying.<br />
And I'm still thankful fory an kind of help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hm, all i get is white screens, unregarding what version i download.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2005, 22:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Try to apply the fix I mentioned earlier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">wish it helped :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">underwatersun</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th January 2005, 14:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hey pj!<br />
thanks for your last try... it looks nice, but it's not what I need ;)<br />
It really should be only black and white. No grey.<br />
<br />
The UWS-V1 I've posted above really comes close, only the white holes in the middle and the fact that there's still something black when there's no sound make it useless.<br />
<br />
If somebody could fix that I'd be really thankful... I tried, but I didn't get any further than this version...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PJ-Avser</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th January 2005, 04:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">How about this... If you don't like the shifting ( I know it's not in the picture ) delete the last line of code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">underwatersun</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th January 2005, 11:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hm... sorry but this one is a little to chaotic even if I delete the shifting. But thanks alot for your enduring help.<br />
<br />
I've optimized my version so that the white holes aren't a real problem any more... <br />
<br />
So everything looks the way I want when there is sound, only when there's none there shouldn't be anything black left and I really cant't get this managed... there's always still the basic motion...</div></div><hr />
