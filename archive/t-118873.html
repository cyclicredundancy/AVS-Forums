<div class="posttext">Have never seemed to be able to set my screen mode to 32bit and can only run in 16bit. Ive checked my graphics card settings and noticed my antialiasing was converting 32 to 16bit which I've disabled. <br />
Still no workee. It happens on avs packs as well so I don't think its my colour range on the presets. hrmmm....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so why are you here?  it's not an avs problem</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you can't see your desktop in 32 bit mode, it's not an AVS problem. It probably is your vid card.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not my windows desktop dude. When running avs no 32bpp<br />
Sorry thought that was OBVIOUS!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't mention AVS in there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, try using overlay mode. Maybe that'll help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;set my screen mode to 32bpp&quot; implies the monitor, not avs</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a 'test preset' for checking if you're in 16-bit:<br />
<br />
- Render / Superscope:<br />
per point: x=i*2-1;y=0;red=i*.5+.5;green=i*.25;blue=1-i*.5;<br />
(other fields default)<br />
<br />
- Trans / Movement:<br />
custom: y=0<br />
<br />
<br />
This will show a color gradient with a low variance in colors. In 16-bit you will see clear vertical bands between the colors, in 32-bit it should look smooth.<br />
<br />
Anyway this is the first time I've heard of this problem, so we can't really give you a clear cut solution. Trying 'fullscreen overlay mode' (checkbox at the top of fullscreen options) might help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well Ive reinstalled my system (even though my graphics card won't install because of motherboard bios conflict)<br />
And hey presto Ive got 32/24 and 16 bpp options which all work fine. <br />
I have tried only reinstalling winamp several times to see if this was a credible fix however maybe there was an issue beyond winamp/.avs itself.<br />
<br />
hmmmm...<br />
<br />
Cheers anyway.</div></div><hr />

That right there is screaming at me. Try updating you BIOS (just don't turn the computer off half way through) and disbling any onboard graphics that you might have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can fix the card issue when I get a few weeks!! (never get an asus A7v333 motherboard - it likes to crap out for just about anything!) Just good that Ive got 32bit colour running in avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No - build my own systems.<br />
Cheaper+faster+more reliability (except where shitty motherboards are involved)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay...so you're technical enough to build your own systems, yet you're not smart enough to realize what a &quot;performance&quot; slidebar does....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">legohead</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th January 2003, 22:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ummm... not smart enough??? I don't think thats appropriate.<br />
Ive got no fikn idea what a 'performance' slide bar is. But I don't think thats because Im dumb. Maybe its because I haven't learn't it - along with the majority of the infinite amount of things to learn out there in the universe that everyone (including atero's) could never entirely learn even over a million lifetimes.<br />
<br />
But please enlighten me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2003, 00:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">dude, what the fuck did you think 'performance' means?  i mean, you started a whole thread about trying to improve avs performance...besides that, right below the damn slidebar says &quot;higher framerate&quot; and &quot;lower framerate&quot; - but you couldn't figure out what that meant, when you were trying to boost the framerate in the first place??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">legohead</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2003, 01:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ummm... no shit shirlock - what settings do you think I meant - the ones in CorelDraw???. Who the fuck calls it a 'performance slidebar'. The fact that you've decided to refer to it as 'performance slidebar' or anything else doesn't make it statutory.<br />
<br />
I think you mean 'the rendering performance slide bar in your fullscreen settings'?? Correct?<br />
<br />
Obviously 'I not down wit yo funky lingo' - and straight forward use of english is (as always) a better alternative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th January 2003, 02:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, it says &quot;windowed performance&quot; and it's a slidebar - hence PERFORMANCE SLIDEBAR.  And a &quot;slidebar&quot; slides back and forth, and it's a bar - hence SLIDEBAR.<br />
I wasn't talking about the one in Fullscreen settings, but it works just as well as an example, especially since you were using it for fullscreen in the first place (unless, for some odd reason, you were running it at 800x600 windowed with screen setting 1600x1200).<br />
<br />
ummm... no shit shirlock - what settings do you think I meant - the ones in CorelDraw???.<br />
What in god's name are you talking about?  Next time, try making statements that actually relate to the thread....<br />
<br />
(BTW it's &quot;sherlock&quot;, dumbass)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">'What in god's name are you talking about? Next time, try making statements that actually relate to the thread.... '<br />
<br />
Yes I should - such as talking about  'performance slide bars' and 'compaqs' in a thread that is discussing a colour mode issue. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and 'windowed performance' is no good to me in fullscreen mode!</div></div><hr />
