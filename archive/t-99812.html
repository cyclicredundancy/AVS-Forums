      <p class="post-content"><strong>A question for UnConeD</strong><br />
      Hi, UnConeD<br />
      <br />
      I am posting this topic directly towards you after trying out your latest pack of presets, which continues on your tradition of blowing away the boundaries of what AVS can do. Right now, I am a fan of your AVS work.<br />
      I am wondering how do you get DM&#194;&#180;s to describe 3D surfaces. I have looked at the equations, but still I would like to understand the basics of this technique, if there is a basic way to it...<br />
      <br />
      Also, I would like an explanation as to what the Buffer tool is, what is it used for and how to use it.<br />
      <br />
      I would like to share my presets here, but since I make extensive use of AVI files in them, they are way too heavy to post.<br />
      <br />
      To all of those working with 3D Dynamic Movements, I extend an invitation to share their knowledge and questions here.<br />
      <br />
      Thanx<br />
      <br />
      Nicol&#195;&#161;s Mendoza</p>

      <p class="post-content">When you say Buffer option, do you mean the one in the DM?<br />
      <br />
      If it's so :<br />
      <br />
      It sets the input of the DM. The DM calculates whatever "distortions" will be applied to the image, and then sends the completed image as an output. The buffer option have a difference - When alphablending is used, the blended part won't be affected by the DM, and the input part for that blended part is "current" in the buffers section. This means, you can make 1 buffer in one area and the other for other areas.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Basically a buffer is a general purpose extra image in memory which isn't displayed. If you need to calculate two separate images which need to be blended in a non-standard way (i.e. an effect list won't do), then you need buffer saves/loads.</p>
