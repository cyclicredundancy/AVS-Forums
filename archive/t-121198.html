		:( <br />
I made something 3D and added some pasic things, but it just not it (it not soundrepsonsible, its boring etc.). Maybe u all can hint me littlebit. And how can i make this ssc little more solid (more dots) without having major slowdown.<br />
And plz dont judge me hard (i know that this is #ßçNÈñ AVS and im newbe).

		Go for some background visual to go with it, layer it ontop of another preset you make that is a good background, using the |+| button on the control screen and go into preset and you can add a whole preset to another good for part-ones that you make ...You can stitch them together. If you didn't know that already ....<br />
<br />
Cool :)

		To make it more soundresponsive you can either use the on-beat box to do different things(change velocity, position, rotation, etc.) or use the getosc/getspec functions or use v.  In order to increase the number of dots without sacrificing speed you will have to take other things out (blurs slow it down a lot).  Also, optimizing your code can help some.

		No offense kid, but your remix isn't that great.  You really can't see much of anything because of the blur/water/color clip combination.  It really hides the superscope which now looks like a blur of color in the middle.

		criticism^, according to ms word, still dont look right tho. Then again, does it really matter.<br />
<br />
Anyway as for the remix annubis is right, cant see the superscope at all, the colours are quite nice but colours cant hold up forever. anyway you get a nice phsycadelic effect with the superscope in the middle if you take away some of the effects.

		Agh, too much white!  Another side effect of water with a colorfade.  It is better now that you can see the SSC though.  Instead of using the built-in effects use a DM.  I'll post one if I get around to making it.

		VisualAgnosia - i can't find good background for it, it just melts together with it and the point of this AVS is gone. But i WILL make some-kind-of-like-good-bascground for this AVS <br />
<br />
anubis2003 - I knew that (i gess). <br />
<br />
KiD cHaMeLeOn - the ssc is not that complikated, my coded is just this part:<br />
x1 =  r * sin(p2 * i * 500 + s);<br />
y1 = r * sin(r *  i * (s + 10));<br />
z1 =  r * cos(p2 * i * 10);<br />
s = bnot(s);<br />
And colours.<br />
All the rest comes from EL-VIS<br />
The &quot;s = bnot(s)&quot; is used to get kind of &quot;solid&quot; cube.  <br />
s returns 1 if s == 1 or 0 if s != 0 (U know what i mean).<br />
 <br />
Jaheckelsafar - uuu.. Nice but ssc dont show out very well.<br />
<br />
As soon as i get time ill wodify (!spelling!) AVS: make some background, make it more dynamick and and eeee...<br />
<br />

In lines it gives bretty good efect, try to add &quot;set rendel mode&quot;.<br />
Yea it makes it grey and i like full cube more i guess I just keep trying to get rid of my newbyness and make this look better...<br />
May anyone hint me with making 3D ssc-s Anubis2003 u did it onese but i cant find enything useful there for making good AVS ssc.

		The scope is nice, and no, there's no way to add more dots without adding more dots :p<br />
Check out the Cubism (Artist-like) preset from my second pack (get it somewhere <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">here</a>), it's got a nice cube-effect (though that's all it's got :rolleyes: )

		Atero thnk u again. I read all about everything and I feel 10 times smarter than i was before. Now I get the 3D ssc main idea <br />
<br />
x = x1 / (z + 2);<br />
y = y1 / (z + 2);<br />
<br />
but the rotation part <br />
<br />
a = a1 * sin(t) + b1 * cos(t);<br />
b = a1 * cos(t) - b1 * sin(t);<br />
<br />
is still little fuzzy (i donno how it works), but i guess that isnt ment to be known for me...<br />
Jaheckelsafar if u look at my preset u will see that i have allready read EL-VIS real_3D_tutorial...<br />

		The rotation part comes from the multiplication of the rotation matrices and the 3-D coordinates.  However, since avs doesn't support matrices, they had to be converted into this format which is a lot harder to use (IMHO).  You can find out more about this in almost any 3-D programming tutorial.  Just search the web.

		you know what...i honestly don't *really* know how it works either, nor have I been able to find a proof of it's correctness.  i'm gonna remove that piece of shit page from the tutorial about translation and rotation... :hang:<br />
<br />
anyway, basically if you want to rotate an object on the X/Y plane, you need to replace a1 and b1 with x1 and y1, the coordinates of the original image.<br />
if you absolutely must, you may use the code given in the tutorial, but i strongly suggest you try to figure it out before you use it :)

		Yeah, There are very few who do know exactly how it works (Unconed does).  Most of us just trust them that it does work and use it with the knowledge we have.  I've tried figuring it out on my own, but I could never get it to look right.  By trying, however, it helped me out a lot with understanding other peoples code because there were some similarities.

		OH my GOD!<br />
Atero are U joking, please say this is a joke, that U are going to remove the translation and rotation part from &quot;AVS Primer&quot;...<br />
This part IS (atleast for me) the MOST useful (I dont say that other things are useless) part of Ur tutorial. How the f***k are newbs (like I am) going to learn the 3D ssc-ing?<br />
No way remove it, make it better ,biger, clearer etc.<br />
And don't worry about that that im going to do just copy_paste from Ur tutorial (I bear math stuff bretty well in my mind) and I dont like to copy from others stuff (it just makes me feel empty) and I get the 3D thing bretty well, exept that rotaton part...<br />
I have noticed that ELVIS uses same code for rotation, doesn't he? <br />
And once again dont U, Atero, never remove this part from your &quot;AVS Primer&quot;...<br />
Anubis im gonna ceck it out as soon as I start learning 3D scriting in C++

		jack, it's totally and completely incorrect.  it'd be much better if I just put a clear, consise explanation of the equation and how to use it.<br />
<br />
and everyone uses the same code for rotation, those rotation matrices are the fastest way to rotate an object.  to be honest, el-vis's code really isn't that great.  for one thing, it's not as fast or as dynamic as it could be, and it isn't even that special in and of itself.<br />
<br />
btw, I know HOW the rotation matrices work, I just don't know WHY

		Atero here is the proof:<br />
Lets take the x,y&lt;-&gt;d,r formula as a prooved fact:  <br />
We will start from <br />
d=sqrt(x1*x1+y1*y1);r=atan2(x1,y1)+t;<br />
x2=sin(r)*d;y2=cos(r)*d;<br />
and <br />
x2=x1*sin(t)+y1*cos(t);y2=y1*sin(t)-x1*cos(t);<br />
<br />
this means that<br />
sin(r)*d=x1*sin(t)+y1*cos(t);<br />
cos(r)*d=y1*sin(t)-x1*cos(t);<br />
<br />
rise this to the power of 2 and you will get:<br />
sin^2(r)*d^2=x1^2*sin^2(t)+2*x1*y1*sin(t)*cos(t)+y1^2*cos^2(t);<br />
cos^2(r)*d^2=x1^2*cos^2(t)-2*x1*y1*sin(t)*cos(t)+y1^2*sin^2(t);<br />
<br />
now add one equalation to the other <br />
d^2(sin^2(r)+cos^2(r))=x1^2(sin^2(t)+cos^2(t))+y1^2(sin^2(t)+cos^2(t))<br />
<br />
now becouse of the sin^2(alpha)+cos^2(alpha)=1 its proven that<br />
d^2=x1^2+y1^2<br />
and since d=sqrt(x1^2+y1^2) you can write this as<br />
x1^2+y1^2=x1^2+y1^2<br />
or<br />
0=0<br />
what is true and that means that <br />
x2=x1*sin(t)+y1*cos(t);y2=y1*sin(t)-x1*cos(t); <br />
is true too

		Jack, that post was completely useless. Nixa was proving that the 3-D rotation equations are true.  And Atero, I think Nixa did answer your question.  If you want personal proof, just sit down and try to figure it out yourself.  This is what I did and although I did it wrong I was easily able to figure out how they actually do work by looking at the equations in you're primer and elsewhere.

		the reason it doesn't work is because you're assuming it's true before you prove it, then using the matrix to prove itself.  you can do the same thing with any arbitrary formula.

		So all proofes made by mathematical induction are wrong then?

		No, all proofs using that which is to be proven to prove them are only using circular logic.  However, looking back at your post I don't think you did this.

		Actually it's in between.<br />
<br />
The only things nixa proved is that if we know that cos^2+sin^2 = 1, then the formula for rotation doesn't modify a point's distance to the origin, which means it was either rotated around the origin, or not moved at all.<br />
However he didn't prove that a point was rotated around the specified angle ;).<br />
<br />
I believe Jheriko will post the actual proof soon in the &quot;AVS Primer - now hiring&quot; thread. I'd post it if I'd remember it from high school ;). In that same thread I've already explained how you go from the rotational formula to a matrix btw.

		Atero,are there actually any more ways to rotate a superscope then the way described in the AVS Primer?  If you want you could  <br />
remove rotation from the AVS Primer but it would be a good idea to leave 3D-2D tranlation in it.
