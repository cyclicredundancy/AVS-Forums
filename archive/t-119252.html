      I have a wish<br />
      <br />
      When you open the AVS editor, and you turn on that little window in the corner......<br />
      <br />
      If that window is on when you try to close the editor, winamp will freeze up. Is there any way someone can fix that? I've lost some good presets when that happened sometimes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can. Check 'dock in config'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And I'm pretty sure that's a problem on your computer only; I usually close AVS with the editor open and no problems here. Try re-insalling Winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oops, didn't read the bottom of that post. :o<br />
      <br />
      Never use the docked window myself. It's too small.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I got the same problem. When you dock the AVS into the Editor, and then close the editor the AVS freezes up and you have to restart Winamp for some reason. I wish that it would automatically undock when you close the window so the damn freeze doesn't occur all the time...</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah...if you're using 3.x you should probably go back to 2.x until the next release; it's much more stable (overall)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have both installed. There are some presets that work in 3.x that don't work in 2.x for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Saying that presets work differently (or at all) with wa3/wa2 is a load of cack. Avs is still the same in both of them although the window in wa3 is different (and looks really ugly IMHO).<br />
      <br />
      I use only wa2 and every preset i have ever viewed worked like a charm.<br />
      <br />
      But again it's a personal situation for every computer... there is no general magical fix it solution to those ones unfortunally :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's true. Crashed Winamp in 2.7, worked fine in 3.0. Tried it again, same result. Tried it after a reboot, same result. :igor:</p>
