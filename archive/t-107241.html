			<strong>I need YOU for The Forward Flow 1.0</strong><br />
		
		

		I need someone to make me some graphics, and a couple people to remix presets.  I'm not going to post anything here as it's a secret and no one would download it if they realized how shitty it really is (j/k).  Is anyone willing to do...anything?<br />
<br />
BTW, Karnov, you could be emotional support.  And UnConeD can be the midwife.

		What do you mean by making graphics? You mean the screenshot?<br />
<br />
And i would be glad to remix too if only a simple play out with color and flow will do... i don't think i will touch your code anyway, it's too far out for me ;)

		S_KuPeRs: Screenshots and a couple other graphics.  What I need is a good quality screenshot made...I have no experience with graphics programs so I wouldn't know how to get what I wanted out of it.  'A couple other graphics' means a bitmap of my name and my pack name...again, no good graphics program.  I want that before I do my screenshots.  Basically I want it in red westminster...but with dancing women and fireworks and...a pony.  I want a pony.  Gimme a pony goddammit!<br />
<br />
I'll post the three presets I need remixed

		Here's a remix. I'm not entirely sure as to whether or not is different enough to qualify as one but I think that it looks phat.<br />

		Ignore that one, I made an idiotic mistake in the preset that costs it fps big time. Here is an even faster version of the same thing.

		Atero, I think you mean Tuggummi, he asked what you meant with graphics. But I would be happy to also do the graphics, but I don't have the westminster font and the dancing women and pony will be difficult. :D <br />
<br />
Oh, and I can't wait to get started with the 'remixables'. I have some great *secret* ideas.

		Augh, I really should review the thread before I post.  Blame it all on short-term memory (or lack thereof) :p<br />

jheriko: As much as I like the effect created, I think the coloring leaves something to be desired.  Sorry :(

		Thanx S_KuPeRs.  The Channel Shift in Spiralesque was meant to change the color of the DM, not the SSCs.  They change automatically on beat, so that channel shift can be gotten rid of ;)

<br />

		I guess I could do the GFX. Personally I would recommend Danjoe, I think his preview pics for his packs are the best in AVS.

Your too late you üb3rfu(k3dn00b! <br />
I already made the remixes...<br />
<br />
As you can clearly see and what might be just <b>slightly</b> obvious i aimed for speed and simplicity in my mixes...<br />
<br />
Damn i just noticed i missed Dark Angel last night because of these!!! :mad: :cry:<br />
<br />
Oh hell... These work from 7-10 fps with my comp which should mean that they work above the enjoyable 25 fps with your comp... not sure about that though :weird:

		Thankeez Tuggummmi :D :D :D :D :D<br />
<br />
I fixed the Starks Raving preset for you...All it was was the scopes were supposed to be circles, not lines :)<br />
(and the rotozoomers were fucked up, but since you got rid of 'em (ya bastard ;) ) it's okay)<br />
<br />
And now...The moment you've all been waiting for...INSTALLERS!  I'm gonna write an installer script right now...Probably going to base it off of jheriko's code, if he doesn't mind, and he doesn't :p<br />
<br />
THANK YOU ALL! :D

		I for one can't wait for it, what I've already seen is good. Hopefully this pack will go down well and raise your standing in the community, you have done some nice coding and some good effects.<br />
<br />
Also I can release some leet 4-d geometry once I get some fast code down for the 4-d shadow matrix with a moving light source. ;) Maybe even make a 4-d julia set cutthrough if I'm feeling really clever, even if it runs at 0.1 fps. :P<br />
<br />
Nice to see people using my script, I think its much better than those ones with message boxes asking you to choose winamp 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck with the release and everything.
