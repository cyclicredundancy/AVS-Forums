      <p class="post-content"><strong>hi quality bitmap rendering/export?</strong><br />
      hello!<br />
      <br />
      is there a possibility to render and export avs visualizations in a very high resolution? (4000x4000 and above, framerate doesn't matter).<br />
      <br />
      i want to print a few screenshots in poster size, that's why i ask.<br />
      <br />
      thx for your help<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thats really great idea, i like it. But right now only way is to set your screen resolution to 4000x4000 :p<br />
      And framerate will be dead slow like this, maybe below 1 :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">dead slow...i don't care if it takes 10 minutes to render one frame for printout...; can i set the screen resolution to a resolution above my actual hw screen res? somehow? or pull the window that big?<br />
      <br />
      an .ape would be helpful, i guess...</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can make a screenshot at max resolution of your AVS. Then open it up in Photoshop. You need a Photoshop plugin called Genuine Fractals. This will allow you to enlarge the image <b>without</b> any quality loss to a quite high resolution. It sure will go to 4000x4000 if you take your screenshots at 1280x1024. It's the way I made my AVS poster, which was 8000x6500.<br />
      <br />
      Genuine Fractals is not free, though I'm sure you can find a place to download it from... ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">By the way, don't waste your time with a screensize like that. (Most) presets are designed for low screensizes and simply don't work right when you enlarge them, esp. texer presets.</p>

      the hi qual file, which resolution has it? 300dpi?<br />
      <br />
      and is the printed image really sharp?<br />
      <br />
      i want to print on 160x120 cm hi quality paper (endless paper inkjet); but i'm afraid it won't be sharp enough for my standards.<br />
      <br />
      besides, genuine fractals scales up lossless only if you once had the image in a big size (the program just uses a different compression than jpeg for instance)...<br />
      you get the same results with normal resizing...</p>

      <br />
      once again.<br />
      <br />
      you are not going to get any sort of quality using avs. if you really need 160x120cm prints that badly, then there are MUCH better options for you. why the fuck are you trying to print fractals with avs anyhow? 1: avs's maths aren't precise enough to get boundless graphical precision, 2: there's faster, better, and less time consuming ways to generate fractals - that send them straight to the disk even. see also: ultrafractal, fractint.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, he wants shots from AVS, not fractals. Genuine <b>fractals</b> is the name of the photoshop plugin that can enlarge images.<br />
      <br />
      @ haagen. It's 600 dpi or something like that. It's not ultimately sharp, but it's good enough to my standards.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you get a big AVS screenie and resize it in photoshop as suggested, then stick it on a disk and take it to a reprographics place and get them to print it. They have huge printers for exactly this kind of application, they'll do it on glssy paper too so it'll feel like a real poster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think there's any way to get higher resolutions than your monitor supports in AVS at the moment though.<br />
      <br />
      Here's an idea though... there's a utility called Powerstrip which allows you to make your own monitor drivers (choose the maximum resolution and refresh rate and such). Using it, you can force a high resolution even if your monitor doesn't support it.<br />
      After doing this, you can go to AVS and select this resolution in fullscreen mode (use regular Fullscreen mode, not Fullscreen overlay). Go fullscreen in AVS and wait a couple seconds (or even 10-20) for the image to render at full res, press the print-screen button on your keyboard and hit escape. You should now have a high-res screenshot sitting on the clipboard, which you can paste in a graphic editing program. If this doesn't work, there are special screencapture utilities that could work, most of them have a timer function and such.<br />
      <br />
      All of this is 'at your own risk' of course. Though any monitor worth its beans should simply refuse to display any resolution it cannot render. I suggest you try with one resolution-step higher than your monitor supports first, to see what happens. If your monitor still tries to display the image, it's a good idea to simply turn off your monitor before going fullscreen, and to turn it back on after going back to normal to prevent damage.<br />
      <br />
      I think most videocards today go up to 2048x1536 which should still look nice when printed (most AVS pictures are quite blurry anyway), especially if you touch it up with Photoshop or something later.</p>

      <p class="post-content">will try the powerstrip thing.<br />
      <br />
      another possibility would be some virtual device driver for a very-high-res monitor... sth in that direction...<br />
