      I use winamp 2.8 if that makes a differance. what is docked or windowed(winamp minimized to task bar or just a extra small line)? I don't see avs display I think your talking about 3.0. Sorry I did not mention that before.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Jaheckelsafar is wise the answer is still there my friend:<br />
      <br />
      Question #1a: What is AVS?<br />
      Question #1b: I downloaded a bunch of AVS plug-ins/presets, but they don't show up in the Winamp plug-ins list!<br />
      <br />
      AVS is a visualisation plug-in that isn't limited to predefined effects: the user can combine the library of built-in effects in endless ways to create so-called presets. There are tons of presets available for download on the web, most of which are a lot better than the default presets (they're a bit outdated).<br />
      To view these presets, start AVS like any other plug-in and right-click the display. You can then choose from all the presets installed.<br />
      <br />
      I do not what more I can say. Right click on the AVS box with the swirly images in it and all becomes clear. I pursume by you first post the section that AVS is working. As the FAQ says these are preset pack not seperate plug-ins.<br />
