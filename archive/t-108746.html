      Dutchguy made the original preset. I played and came up with the other tunnel3. I'd like to distribute it, but Dutchguy never gave me the go ahead when I asked and he seems to have disappeared. If I do distrubute he'd get credit for the background because I didn't make it at all, but the movement that IMHO makes the preset is all mine. Could I sneak it in as a remix of a never released original? :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Remixes of never released originals are fine in my mind.<br />
      <br />
      Also I'd say that if you made the movement (ie the preset) then you should release it as your own. Maybe thats just me and my 'code is everything' attitude... i dunno.<br />
      <br />
      Hm... guess I haven't been much help here.</p>

      If you do use code from other people, give some credit in a comment</p>

      Please. It does my head in when someone says something crap like: 'Thanks go out to r4nd0m_n00b for his excelent movement code', then the movement turns out to be x=0.

      I'm not sure I want to include it now thought. The twistest mix of bizarre space twisting is sooo much better. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Of course dumb, small things like that should not be credited, I was referring more to code such as in the example you gave. To rephrase what I said eariler, give credit to <i>original</i> code that is not commonplace, such as the DMs el-vis used.</p>
