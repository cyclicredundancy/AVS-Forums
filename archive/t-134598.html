      <p class="post-content"><strong>a good idea.</strong><br />
      i have an idea for your visualization studo. when i download music, i like to download music videos too. with the wonderful technology of winamp3, i can have them in the same playlist with all the mp3's. but i like to watch visualization studio fullscreen while i listen to music. it works great until a video comes on. i wonder, could you build an add-on that automatically plays video fullscreen, but only when avs is fullscreen? then, it could simply override the avs window, play the video, and close the video window at the completion of the song. it would be perfect!!!<br />
      <br />
      if there's already something like this, please let me know...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, this needs rather a fix in the winamp playlist than in avs itself. I hope for you the nullsofties will read this somewhen.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>seeing as they put the option in, i think that it is meant to be there. whether it is optimal or not is another issue.<br />
      Plus, i think it kindof ruins the whole idea if you can NEVER watch avs in fullscreen.<br />
      <br />
      The thing you want to do is not an APE, in fact, it probably should be in a different forum. All that needs be done is that when a video comes on, winamp closes the avs window, and the video launches fullscreen. Done simultaniously, so your monitor doesnt have to flick between avs/windows/video res's, just avs/video.
