			<strong>visbot.net japan only packs</strong><br />
		
		

		what's the deal with visbot.net and their japan only packs i thought that avs presets were ment to be downloaded by anybody worldwide i find it quite insulting that there are avs packs ment for one country only and not for the whole world to download what if somebody made a pack for australia for example that means that most people would not be able to download it most of these japan only packs are made by yathosho and duo and i think they should do something about it otherwise whats the point of trying to download something then realise that you cant because it's ment for another country only

		I agree, it is frustrating.<br />
<br />
The very fact that I'm not allowed to see what's on the other side of that door certainly piques my interest. I was so upset about it that at one point I messaged Yathosho inquiring about it. I've since lost the reply, but it wasn't a very direct answer.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about it. It's probably nothing all too exciting. I've resided in the fact that there probably aren't too many Japanese viewers of AVS. How many Japanese AVS artists are there? I don't think I know any, but I'll bet you can count them on one hand. :p

<br />
Political reasons?

		Maybe it involves text, and text needs to be translated (lazy jerks).

i don't see why you find it insulting. it's up to the artists to decide who is going to see their creations, and also to decide if anyone is going to see them at all. and in any case, i don't think that bringing this matter to the forums is the fastest nor the most appropiate way to get an answer.

		I think some people on the Visbot team think its cool for some reason... I can kind of see their logic. Its sort of cool to make hidden features and more personalised installs. <br />
<br />
At the same time I can see the reverse side of the argument, which is that AVS is way to small and crappy niche of entertainment to be making these sorts of efforts. i.e. its not cool.<br />
<br />
Personally, its never bothered me that much... I just think of it like a quirky visbot personality trait..  besides, if you change your country settings you can undo the effect anyway :P
