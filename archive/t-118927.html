<div class="posttext">Someone please answer with a little more information this time!!!<br />
<br />
How do you make a screenshot of an AVS preset?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hold alt and PrtScrn. go to a graphic program (MS Paint or something) and press edit and paste. Do that when the AVS is the current window. no harder no easier...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay...you've asked this question 3 times now.  Every time, we've given you extremely clear answers.  If you forgot, then search the forum; don't make another annoying post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Kagnar</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2003, 02:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I got it figured out now, at the time I didn't really know what a graphic program was.  But when Jonasc1 said MS Paint, I got it.  <br />

<div class="posttext">Forget about MS Paint unless you want to be stuck in the stone age. You should've followed my advice (http://acko.net/node.php?id=21) :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th January 2003, 08:48</div></div>

<div class="posttext">The fact that it's stone-age isn't the reason not to use it - it's the craphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I use Irfanview (http://www.irfanview.com) to capture screenshots...it allows you to use any key and can also caputre every x seconds, so you get a range of presets to choose from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, seriously, micheal, you should REALLY stop bringing up dead-ass threads.  Look at the timestamps.  This thread is nearly a month old.  I don't care if you don't think that means it's dead, the fact remains it's been inactive for a month, which means it's just not cared about anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st February 2003, 01:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, the person originally asking about this hasn't made a post since january 4th.  They most likely will not check back and see this (unless if they are subscribed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Reviving old threads is only good when the thread is very specific (e.g. instead of all the repeating threads about live AVS, we should have one big 'live AVS thread'). In that case it's good to group everything together.<br />
<br />
I just wish vBulletin would have an indicator of when a thread spans more than 2 months or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st February 2003, 07:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It'd work about as much as &quot;Before you start a new thread, search the forums...&quot; or whatever it says</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st February 2003, 17:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No but I mean then you wouldn't think &quot;huh? new big thread and I haven't noticed?&quot; but you'd see &quot;aha, old thread revival&quot;. For example by making the background of the thread's entry in the forum slightly darker, or reddish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd February 2003, 07:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">based on the last post, not the thread start, i assume :p (thread start would be eternally obnoxious considering threads that last weeks and weeks before they die)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd February 2003, 22:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually no, I was considering total time span. I said &quot;2 months&quot;, which is quite enough time for a regular thread to die. And if it isn't, well then it IS an obnoxious thread :).<br />
<br />
Only referring to the last post would make a revived thread that has been replied to seem normal again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd February 2003, 22:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">But what about threads like the &quot;what would you do if&quot; game thread in GD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2003, 02:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Exactly.  When the person sees the thread and it's all reddish in the background, he'll say &quot;Hey!  It's an old thread!&quot; and won't revive it.  I think having a trigger signifying a post that has been revived after 3-5+ weeks (turning it yellow or something) would be kind of nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2003, 03:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, but this wouldn't stop people from reviving old threads.  Also, they would have to make the amount of time given before the thread becomes dead forum-independent. In GD, 2wks of no posts should be the limit, but in the Other Visualizations Forum, it could be more like 2 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2003, 12:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Stupid suggestion here.<br />
<br />
The longer the thread has been dead, the longer it will take to post.<br />
1 minute per month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2003, 15:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Reviving old threads isn't bad in most cases though, I just want an indication that is old.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">just browsing around and got all excited with the words live and avs. as you know im into this particular subject and think it would be pretty cool to have a bit more attention drawn to it. ive played around with a few other apps for vj-ing, visual jockey and arkaos and i think winamp avs is in a different class. and with you lot out there  producing preset packs of such high quality, .....you know where im going with this. in short, a live avs section thingey should happen. just realised this aint a problem post. emm........sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th February 2003, 02:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Why are you talking about live avs??? This thread has nothing to do with it.  You can do live avs with the linein.  Just search the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th February 2003, 02:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Live AVS?<br />
<br />
First of all, it WON'T go nicely - There will be long moments of crappiness, working on huge DMs/SSCs will result in long times of emptiness, and besides, the pressure...<br />
<br />
High-quality presets take from an hour from a month - So Live AVS won't work unless you're going from mediocre to good presets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th February 2003, 02:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nic, I think he is talking about having AVS work with live music. Not AVS being created live. I.E. having AVS render to something a band is playing at that moment.  This can be accomplished using the linein:\\ stuff.</div></div><hr />

i just thought that was a good idea is all. im getting a bit tired of this &quot;search the forums&quot; stuff, i thought i was just being relevant to something that was mentioned. i am soon to be syncing avs to a gig true, and im throwing myself in the deep end, but if theres a better place to get info on this subject, like i said, pls link me.</div></div><hr />

This thread was never a &quot;thread about live AVS&quot;. Unconed was just using that as an example. Read what is being said before assuming something.  If you did you would realize that live AVS was not actually discussed about, except in the context of a generic example.<br />
Here is a quote from the FAQ on the main avs page.  It's not that difficult to find.  There are many threads on this topic.<br />

Yes you can use AVS or any other visualization for that matter for live sets: <br />

This has nothing to do with AVS, so I would post any questions that searching the Forums will not answer for you in a Winamp technical help forum.  AVS merely runs off of whatever winamp is playing, so to get it to respond to live music, that live music has to be fed through winamp.</div></div><hr />
