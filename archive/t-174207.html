      <p class="post-content"><strong>back to life! physics, metaball refraction (what i made last week)</strong><br />
      it's been a horrible week. NO WINAMP FORUM! me was :cry: and :( and :mad: and also :confused: .<br />
      but now it's back again.<br />
      well just wanted to show you my newest presets. i dunno why i post all this crap here. maybe i just need some response to it.<br />
      the first thing i made is, more or less real physics. there is one preset with two colliding objects. i didn't manage to make real real physics, with rotation and so, but it fun to watch it. the second one is a simple rope, with very lousy physics.<br />
      the thing i'm really proud of are my metaparticles with refraction. i know that this ain't new, but i made it all myself. noone helped me.<br />
      then there is also one problem, hehe. i added phong shading like lighting to the metaparticles. there is a light floating around, which lights up the metamass. the strange thing is that the light source only emits light towards the meta mass. what i expected is that there is a big light ball which only is interupted by the "hills" of the metamass. if you want to see what i mean, just set the output of the last effectlist of "drips physique2" to replace.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know. Btw, can someone out there tell me a places which offers complex physic-maths?<br />
      Hm, I got 17 downloads. Cool.<br />
      Please reply more. :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Physics has been done before (and with more objects)... plus your objects seem to stick together when they bounce against eachother.</p>

      <p class="post-content">where? can you tell me where to get those presets?<br />
      <br />
      i know that they stuck, but i was not yet able to kill this nasty bug.</p>
