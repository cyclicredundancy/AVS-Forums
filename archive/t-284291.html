			<strong>Wfc7</strong><br />
		
		

		Lets do WFC7.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to do all the gathering of presets, making of installers etc. plus it would give me a reason to write a preset beyond finishing my own &quot;4 years late&quot; pack.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking no strict limits on preset count, but preferably 2-4 from each artist and one remix each.<br />
<br />
Sound fun?

		i urge all contributors to send submissions together with all required external files such as texer images. that's most of the work i had with past wfc packs. send submissions as one zip file that includes all the presets and extra files, maybe you can even adapt the naming system for your presets minus the preset number.

Are you to Jheriko? (with presets and remixing? - I would like to see some stuff from you - maybe more of this awsome Hypercube projection.) You (and Pak's) projections really turned a switch in my head. I don't understand the preset, but i really got interested for 4d ... . (by the way this: <a href="http://www.polytope.de/arch4.html" target="_blank">http://www.polytope.de/arch4.html</a> is a very cool page - it's in german, but with some random clicks it might still keep up your fascination).

Nanaki: 5D is on my list of possibilities. I was thinking of projecting the 5-simplex onto a 4-sphere onto a 3-plane onto a 2-plane...<br />

anyone know how to do 3d wall bouncing. i've tried converting a simple 2d window bounce code so that it detects a 3rd dimension but it just get borked after the 3rd hit on one of the walls.

		since i guess that in your 2d bouncing code x and y act independently from each other, i think it should be trivial to write the same lines a third time and use <i>z</i>'s instead of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.<br />
if you need anymore help, detail your probleme a little bit more...<br />

			<strong>Idea.</strong><br />
		
		

		I just watched Ghost In The Shell SAC SSS<br />
and i noticed a interesting visual.<br />
the visual consisted of dots following a line pattern on the joints in random intervals while following around the screen.<br />
just wondered how i would be able to do that in avs.<br />
this might be beyond me but i normally try these things without buffers but this sounds like it can only be done with them.<br />
<br />
if yer confused on this then it might help if I say its the intro to the movie I'm speaking of.<br />
<br />
any help in this would be greatly appreciated. i suck at buffers and normally these things escape but i really want to do that visual and was wondering if someone can make the basic structure of the buffers for me. so i can build the preset around it. all credit will be given off course.

		chillax. i stole tons of ideas for my presets... trying to recreate a specific effect is a good thing to do imo. it trains you in how to think about these things. and makes you realise precisely how useless a description like &quot;the visual consisted of dots following a line pattern on the joints in random intervals while following around the screen.&quot; is.<br />
<br />
got a picture?<br />

I should probably download the film asap having watched both series (serieses? serii? f#@king english... irregular plural nouns... grrr). the wiki page is loaded with spoilers btw :/

		hey micro! cool to see you here :up: <br />
<br />
you said you have 2 presets and one remix, right?<br />
I think you missunderstood one thing a little. The wfc-&quot;system&quot; works as following:<br />
<br />
every participant sends 2 preset to the wfc-god (this time it's Jheriko). maybe it's up to 4 presets this time - the page before someone said he'd sent 4 - don't know.<br />
<br />
After the time is over (april i think - it's also the page before :confused: ) the wfc-god will send to every participant presets from another one. So everyone gets a presets he has never seen before and remixes it - or not - no problem.<br />
<br />
tada lala<br />

		j- how many presets have been sent in? it's almost april and i can't wait to see how this compilation turns out, but from what i gather from this thread it looks like a pretty small turnout. a lot of the biggies are nowhere to be seen.

		I think i'm here back after i dont know how many months(years maybe?)....<br />
<br />
I need to do a little warm-up though before i can make something worthwhile(as if i did make anything worthwhile before :p ).<br />
I'm totally out-of-touch...<br />
&quot;Duh! whats a superscope?&quot; :D<br />
<br />
I hope i'm in time for WFC8 though... I'll make some crap(which jheriko will filter out entirely, &quot;according to his /perfect/ standards&quot; ;) )<br />
Anyway, Good luck with WFC7! I'll be waiting for it!<br />
<br />
(I dont even remember which was the last WFC i took part in... Anybody?)

		funny.<br />
it seems we are one person short this time.<br />
what happened to J-avs<br />
his work next to Nudges i always did my best remixes on.<br />
hmph.<br />
lol<br />
oh well. i'll miss his work but at last we haves Nudge this time lo. now i can be real creative depending on what this dual rotation thing looks like =^_^=<br />
lol<br />
hey jheriko my presets make it ok.

		nankiwurkz; my dual rotation idea is still just an idea because i suck at the maths required and i have a feeling it'd be next to impossible to do without megabuf, which i have very little knowledge of. however, i'd made sure to send in 2 okay-ish presets and 2 that should raise my standard a little.

		nudge. elaborate on your idea<br />
<br />
its possible to crush n rotations down to 3 dot products per frame using change of basis, as long as they all have the same centre of rotation...<br />
<br />
if you are planning a 3d flow it can be done... also warn me ;)

If you need any help give me a shout or come into #avs. Certainly, this is not a hard problem from my perspective... so I am sure I can help you get over the hurdles if needs be.<br />

		What would be realy cool is if a rubix cube would scramble itself for a like 30 seconds based on the music playing, and then either solve itself, or do a high speed rewind.

as a matter of fact that would be quite cool.<br />
or even better<br />
keep the auto solve and scramble but put in interactivity where you have 30 seconds to solve it or the music resets it.<br />
<br />
that would make quite the fun little preset. you can watch or play what ever you prefer, and i know this would take some serious coding but i'm sure it can be done using the ol avstrans ape.<br />

		There aren't too many presets yet.. but enough to make the pack if needed. I'd like to extend the deadline and give everyone a bit more time... however if nobody else will join we might as well start remixing.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think...<br />
<br />
I of course will be contributing a couple of tech heavy presets. Because there is quite a good variety of skill levels here it might be nicer to do some really collaborative remixing... I much prefer collabs to remixes... but I know that it is just my opinion... by interacting more heavily during the process you can explain to others how something they want to change works... or even change it for them because you are familiar with the preset etc... although that sounds most handy for code, its probably more useful for all the hacky effects out there. :)<br />
<br />
Let me know anyways...

	<blockquote>

I disagree, I think remixes have bloated all the previous packs out and that many are only marginally different from the originals... something which stems from the difficulty of messing with someone elses code in my experience. Not that all the remixes are crap, but a pack where there are as many, or more remixes than originals can be irritating...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I am doing the intro btw, clearly... no offense guys. I was planning on a 3d model and dynamic lighting extravaganza. Intros are particularly amenable to huge piles of tech. :)

		hmm<br />
thats true to jheriko but remixes is always been what WFC was about.<br />
it would be hard to leave them out.<br />
but i suggest this time you let the people choose if they want to remix or not.<br />
lol<br />
that might help.<br />
seeing as theres only a handful this time.<br />
maybe if we had like 10 artists then the remixes could start flying.<br />
lol.

		sounds all fancy in my pantsy.<br />
i would love to see remixes still, but maybe only one remix for every 2 originals. we'd remix both, but leave it up to J which one made it into the pack based on quality.

		sorry guys, i've been awol a bit recently. between internet problems and social life i haven't checked my e-mail in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
I will start putting the thing together tonight. I think I'll wait for 30th before starting the remixing off... just so any late people can get their stuff in on time. :)<br />
<br />
I'd like to do a full collab with someone too if possible... imo they are usually the presets that stand out above the rest. I have quite a few &quot;half a preset&quot;s that can be used...

If you read this please remove one of the presets, i send you.<br />
i want to put &quot;simple 3d #4 new __ the dream i tried to catch.avs&quot; in a pack later. - Or at least i want just my two presets in the wfc7 pack. The others are much easier to remix i think.<br />

<br />
deadline is ... erm... lets say end of june to give micro d plenty of time for his. :)

		sorry guys. i've been offline loads recently... i'm not gonna make any promises to do anything when i get home this time!<br />
<br />
i really wanted to do some collabs... i have a couple of model presets ready but i have two problems. one of which grandchild may have noticed already... which is that i need to take the time to set up xp again if I want to see my presets with correct &quot;gettime&quot; code, so atm all my &quot;time independent&quot; code is almost complete guesswork. second is that my internet is going up and down like a yo-yo.<br />
<br />
i'll try my best though... :)

i could be the one to compile it if j is unavailable. i'd happily do that :) deadline in my book is end of june, correct? extensions would be fine with me, since uni is cracking down on me :p

		i have to admit that i have done no avs work for the wfc7 in the recent weeks, and i will try to do that this weekend. (the first one in some weeks that i am home :P)<br />
university is really keeping me busy and since it's so math-heavy i have little inclanation to fiddle with code and functions for hours on end... i'll be more active on the scene in august/september when i have vacation.<br />
<br />
but i'll do sth this weekend, so if you could hold on a little longer, i'm sorry :(<br />

I was most impressed with your stuff Nudge. even tho 3 of them were from Nudge V_10 as re-works.<br />
<br />
lol<br />
like i care tho.<br />
your re-works are so far different each time they are virtually new presets<br />
lol.<br />
<br />
and the fact you said my stuff was impressive just made my day.<br />
D.N.A was prolly the most hardest and single most worked on preset i ever did.<br />
try 3 months of tinkering.<br />
mostly due to me not picking up avs for a month and the rest for lazyness. i had to relearn everything using my presets.<br />
<br />
also i say this.<br />
woooooooooooooooooooooooot!!!<br />
Jheriko i love yer winamp icon it is so beautiful.<br />
now i feel like trashing it with remix galore<br />
lol.<br />
ok maybe i'll kill the starfield and add some of my usual pizaz.

ok ok its not much better then Jheriko's original.<br />
but at least its cool looking<br />
Jheriko please don't kill me.

It paid off... its one of the best presets I've seen for a while... way beyond the standard that I was expecting from you to be honest.<br />
<br />
I'll check the remix later. The starfield was there so that an easy remix could have been made by changing it to something good, so I probably won't be doing any killing today...

let me guess.<br />
it brought back memories of your long lost DNA Analysis presets for the days of old.<br />
<br />
<br />
tell you one thing the triangles thing was a pain in the butt to get to move right seeing as i had to make all the rotation matrices by hand.

		don't complain at me about rotation matrices. you won't get sympathy. if you find the actual matrices hard to remember then use the correct, easy to remember form:<br />
<br />
c1 = c1*cos(rc3) - c2*sin(rc3);<br />
c2 = c1*sin(rc3) + c2*cos(rc3);<br />
<br />
c1,c2 are two of the coordinate axes and rc3 is the rotation about the third axis. remember that you should cycle the coords, e.g. do x,y around z, then do <b>z,x</b> around y, then do y,z around x. if you try doing x,z you will hit a snag.<br />
<br />
another tip: if you have a load of identical rotations, rotate the basis vectors then transform. i.e. rotate X = {1,0,0} Y = {0,1,0} and Z = {0,0,1} into components so that the rotating X gives rX = {rXx, rXy, rXz}, Y gives rY = {rYx, rYy, rYz} and rZ = {rZx, rZy, rZz}. You can then convert an x,y,z in the original coordinate system into a new, rotated, x',y',z' based on the new basis vectors:<br />
<br />
x' = x*rXx + y*rYx + z*rZx;<br />
y' = x*rXy + y*rYy + z*rZy;<br />
z' = x*rXz + y*rYz + z*rZz;<br />
<br />
saves one multiplication per point at the cost of a rotation matrix per frame, and this is for each rotation used. since its possible to combine multiple rotations (but not translations) on frame and recreate the results by using this same method. (rotate X,Y,Z more than once to produce the rX, rY and rZ components).<br />
<br />
this can be extended to include translations as well, provided that you store an extra set of components to describe them and you rotate these vectors too.<br />
<br />
not sure if this helps, but i'm guessing that this was part of the problem... the great thing about working with basis vectors is that you effectively rotate the whole space at once, rather than each point one at a time, so you can store the basis vectors in registers/megabuf and reuse them as you wish. the result is a little more efficient, and easier to reproduce, than using the 3 2x2 matrices normally used (3 muls less), and although its fractionally less efficient (per frame only) as the 3x3 matrix its a lot easier to remember.<br />
<br />
on second thoughts... this is all quite a lot to remember. sorry. :P

*spins around in confusion.<br />
i was complaining.<br />
i had to relearn half of the math stuff i learned in avs so it was sorta hard to do.<br />
that and i had to translate 3 axis of movement in the triangles to a 2D screen not the easiest thing in the world for seeing as i'm not a mathmetical genius as you and UnConed are.<br />
<br />
:-P<br />
<br />
anyway thanks for the small lesson i'm sure i'll figure it out someday.........*faints from trying to calculate it<br />

		its easier if you don't take the attitude of &quot;i'm not a mathematical genius&quot; use google and copy equations. you don't need to understand them all that much. :)<br />
<br />
if you can lose that attitude you are halfway to finding maths easy. you have the capacity for it... your brain solves a relatively complicated mathematical problems several times a second... orders of magnitude more complicated than the kind of crap avs requires. so you do have the capacity for it... most of us all do. :)<br />
<br />
for the matrices though just try to remember that it is cos - sin, sin + cos. that saves me looking it up every time<br />
<br />
it has other nice properties too, e.g. the first is the negative of the second and vice versa. cos(-x) = -cos(x) = cos(x).<br />
<br />
the &quot;correct&quot; circle formula in radial coords is x = cos(r), y = sin(r), lining up with the matrix<br />
<br />
if you go round clockwise you get a 90 degree rotation at each &quot;step&quot;<br />
<br />
cos(r) - sin(r) = cos(r) + cos(r + 90deg)<br />
sin(r) + cos(r) = cos(r + 270deg) + cos(r + 180deg)<br />
<br />
so no actual need to use the sin function ever... its just a notational convenience.<br />
<br />
<br />
i used to find remembering the rotation matrices hard too. in fact i used to universally despise matrices... but thats another story altogether. (where the hell does that multiply really come from, eh? at least i know now. :))

		Good job getting the pack out at last ;)<br />
<br />
Nanakiwurkz most of what you are discussing is covered in the programming guide, I recommend you look there for an AVS-centric guide to rotation matrices.
