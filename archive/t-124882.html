      <p class="post-content"><strong>Kaliedascope??</strong><br />
      Has anyone created any Kaliedascopic visualisation?? I find them quite enjoyable. Wouldn't mind putting together a pack for it. I'd like to see what anyone else has got first?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes they're certainly hard to find. Ive watched a Kaleidascopic music dvd which prompted me to look into it. Trippy!</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not hard to find attempts at kaleidoscopes, but it is [nearly] impossible to find one. Maybe UnConeD will look at this preset and make one. *hint* *hint*. If anyone could make one, he probably can.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice kaleidoscopes Nic. Still not perfect, but some of them are close. Of course, some of them aren't even really kaleidoscopic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i tried to make a true kaleidoscope movement a while back, but I couldn't get a proper reflection on D. the simple R reflection is:<br />
      r=asin(sin(r*pi*6))/6 (or something like that, i'd check but i'm a bit busy right now)<br />
      anyway i couldn't get a polygonal reflection for D, only circular ones, which aren't kaleidoscopic</p>

      <p class="post-content">Excellent I'll check these out when I get home tonight. It seems to me that the colour spectrum is the hardest aspect. The solarised colours we usually see in .avs don't really give off the realistic textural effect Im after (ultimately). Maybe working with a BMP texture could be worthwhile. Anyway Ive managed to get some good forms happening in the meantime. Cheers</p>
