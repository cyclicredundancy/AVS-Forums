      <p class="post-content"><strong>Sneak peek at AVS pack!!!</strong><br />
      Here's a sneak peek at assorted stuff I've made. Some of them are repetitious-but it's just a preview.<br />
      <br />
      I especially appreciate feedback that says which preset out of a bunch of similar ones you like best (or if you like multiple ones).<br />
      <br />
      I'm looking forward to any kind of feedback, suggestions, or criticism.<br />
      <br />
      Again-just a preview; so tell me what you think.<br />
      <br />
      --C. Mountford--<br />
      P.S. - the preview is starting out fairly large; but as I get feedback as to favorite similar presets, I'll refine it.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>which ones to cut</strong><br />
      Which to go, which to go? A tough question...<br />
      I know some of the presets need to be cut out from my final AVS pack, so as to give it enough variety; but being the creator of them, I have trouble deciding which presets should be removed from my final pack (I still keep them saved). I'm looking for other opinions as to which of the similar presets are the best; that's how I'll decide which to keep for my actual AVS pack release (that's why this is a preview)<br />
      <br />
      As always, suggestions or improvements are always welcome<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>one more preset</strong><br />
      Here's another preset I made. It started out as one of my presets in the last pack, but I changed the superscope quite a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Newbies: I have a lot of presets with superscopes in them. Some of them are very similar, but some of them are fairly different but obviously related (came from the same original preset). Only one or two DMs though. I'm still working on learning that.<br />
      <br />
      I have a couple few questions about DMs. How would I make a DM that would be like a "shifted big swirl out" that would reverse nicely? By that I mean that it would do the reverse more gradually than the semi-selected ("ghost select") source map does? By semi-selected, I mean that the checkbox is gray (if you click it twice, starting out with it unchecked).<br />
      <br />
      My 2nd question is a question related to all the presets in my pack that are different versions of "attempted recovery." What do you guys think would make it a little liss boring (DMs)? I want to get a smooth reversal possibly like the one in my first question, but if you can explain something better, I'll put it in the book I'm writing, too. The more ideas, the better. (The section in my book will be about making the transition from movements to DM. I'm trying to create a DM version of the built-in movements that will be like the semi-selected source map-so it can reverse.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I just realized that these next questions are more suited for answering in my thread called "LOTR Fans!!!"<br />
      <br />
      Thirdly, is there some way to make a DM/Superscope combination to make a preset that looks like the tower of Barad Dur (in the Lord of the Rings movie, it's the tower built by the Dark Lord Sauron. I may have to settle for Mount Doom (Barad Dur will probably be too hard to do in AVS without using a Bryce picture I made, but I don't think movements work well with pictures. I don't know about DMs, though).<br />
      <br />
      I'd like the preset to make some object appear in the distance. Then, I'd like it to start zooming in until the object becomes closer and closer. If I do Barad Dur, I'd want it to zoom into the bottom of it, then have it be like the camera were on top of an elevator and have it move up to the top of the tower. If I do Mount Doom, I'd want it to definitely zoom in, and if possible, distort it to where it appears that the the camera is rotating around it. If that's not possible, how would I just zoom in on the top part that's erupting?<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure if any of these are possible to make in AVS, (but if any of you know software made to create stuff like that, I'd be interested. But I have to admit it would take some of the fun out of making it if I used something exclusively made to create stuff like that. It's just one of those things that's cool simply knowing it's possible to make in AVS).<br />
      <br />
      Any new ideas that would be more practical would be greatly appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      (Here's a little note to explain the unusual name: The reason I called the preset "attempted recovery" was that I had created a cool preset on the laptop a few minutes before, but then I went back to doing homework for a while. I needed to type somethign up for homework, but the monitor turned off, so I pressed the spacebar not realizing that it would load a new preset in Winamp. I realized that I'd just lost it, but I had to finish my homework first, so I couldn't try to re-create it until the next day. Of course, after a day goes by, it's anything but imposible to get every setting exactly the same as before, so I called it *attempted* recovery.)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>still need opinions &amp; help with DM</strong><br />
      I'm still anxious to hear your opinions about which presets are your favorites in my AVS pack! Please tell me your favorite presets so I can trim my pack down to eliminate all but the best out of the very similar presets!<br />
      <br />
      I'm hoping maybe some of you experts can give me some help with my DM questions in the previous post. :)<br />
      <br />
      In response to a post by Atmo The Freak "Not bad, but for that many presets i'd prefer to see some more variety."<br />
      <br />
      I made some new presets today that I think have more variety than the ones in my previous presets (I hope). Please check these new ones &amp; all my old presets so I can know which you like the best. Tell me what you think about these; if there's something you don't like or if there's something you'd like to see. I'm considering replacing some of the similar presets with these new presets I just modified today to give more visual variety.<br />
      <br />
      "There are too many remixes that just look too similar IMO."<br />
      <br />
      I agree that I need to get rid of some of them, so please give me some idea which presets that you like best.<br />
      <br />
      "Most of them give a nice high frame rate though."<br />
      I started out trying to design ones to be good for fullscreen VJs, but I started doing some other projects that had slower framerates(like my LOTR-themed presets that are supposed to look like Sauron's eye). But I *hope* :D they aren't too terrible :)<br />
      <br />
      Do you like them? Do you hate them? I have no idea right now, so please tell me (if you're saying that they're bad, please tell me which ones are bad so I can cut them out)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>finally got araound to it</strong><br />
      I finally got around to looking at all your presets. Here's wha I come up with.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      specifics:<br />
      <br />
      chaz 3.5 - increase line width<br />
      color waterfall - again, linewidth - perhaps scope that reacts more to the music<br />
      colorful lazerlight - looks kinda like chaz 3.5<br />
      eye 2.5 cat 2 - already gave you my oninion on this :)<br />
      fountain of life 2.5 with colorfade - liked this one :)<br />
      ghosts in anoth dimension 2 - the colors work better in this one<br />
      goblet of life - coiuldn't really tell a difference between the mixes<br />
      blinding cydonia - looks like high gforces 2<br />
      high gforces - liked nuber 3 the best<br />
      much fanicier lightg effects - also looks like chaz3.5<br />
      superscope collection - these looked prettymuch the same<br />
      swimming in colors - again, couldn't tell much of a difference<br />
      the eye - I believe this one was covered in another thread<br />
      twisty freaking box - I couldn't see much of a difference again<br />
      new superscope change - lookes like some others, but the blitter feedback makes it better<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      overall:<br />
      <br />
      - Check you movements. Some you use x and y when they are set to use polar coordinates. THe slows things down.<br />
      - You like the wather effect, don't you :)<br />
      - In some presets, you what going because there is too much going on. Combine that with a water effect and you completely lost.<br />
      - You might want to develop a bigger variety of superscopes, I saw the same one used several times, which isn't really bad, provided it isn't in a leading role<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      general comments:<br />
      <br />
      Some I liked. Some I did not. I like trippy colours, but you can have too much of a good thing. I think some work needs to go into this before publishing. Trim it down (definately!), keep only the ones you feel are truly exceptional. Remember, we all design presets for ourselves, not others. In the end, you decide what goes and what stays, not us. They are your presets, don't let others pollute your vision.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thanks</strong><br />
      Thank you for your input. I've been working to make some better presets.<br />
      <br />
      I've noticed that not many people have downloaded my new presets in the more recent .zip files. (fyi: they are just add-ons to the previous .zip files; none of them are actually a complete set.)<br />
      <br />
      I'm still hoping for some help with my DM question earlier in this thread, and for some input for some of my newer presets.<br />
      <br />
      With that said, I made a few more presets over the weekend. I hope you like them.<br />
      <br />
      --------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      As always, input is always appreciated. Praise and criticism, suggestions and complaints-I'm always grateful for any kind of input<br />

      --Edit--:<br />
      P.S. I haven't forgotten; I'm still trying to figure which ones to throw out...but I'm making progress :)<br />
      <br />
      --2nd edit--<br />
      This zip file may contain some duplicat presets (I did some weird stuff because I originally named it the same thing as my previous zip file, so I had to change some things, which may have messed things up a little bit.</p>

      Nice work. Kalidoscopeaphobia and Strobacolorific plasma scopes are pretty cool, nice high fps.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Here's something that may help with your DM question. It's a PM reply I sent someone posted in entirety (frankly I don't know why it's on my HD). :weird:<br />
      <br />
      Gimme a few days before I check the updates out.<br />
      <br />
      **********************************************************<br />
      <br />
      Here's an equation I used in a dynamic movement that you might be able to modify to use in a superscope. It was used in "moving kalidescope" in my AVS pack where it included rotation and zooming. It produces a nice movement that can gradually or suddenly change direction depending on the value for cmx for x and cmy for y.<br />
      <br />
      ----------------<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">perframe:</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">mx=mx+incmx*.2;<br />
      my=my+incmy*.2;<br />
      incmx=incmx+(destmx-incmx)*cmx;<br />
      incmy=incmy+(destmy-incmy)*cmy;</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">onbeat:</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">destmx=rand(200)/200-.5;<br />
      destmy=rand(200)/200-.5;<br />
      cmx=1/((rand(200)/10)+1);<br />
      cmy=1/((rand(200)/10)+1);</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">per pixel:</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">x=x+mx;<br />
      y=y+my;</font><br />
      <br />
      ----------------<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">Variable Explanation</font><br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">mx</font> = the amount to move x by<br />
      <font color="blue">incmx</font> = the amount to increment mx by<br />
      <font color="blue">destmx</font> = the target value for mx to be<br />
      <font color="blue">cmx</font> = how long you want the change in direaction to take to take (the smaller, the longer)<br />
      <br />
      ----------------<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">How it works</font><br />
      <br />
      - <font color="blue">x</font> is changed by the value in <font color="blue">mx</font>, multiplied by .2 to scale it down<br />
      - <font color="blue">mx</font> is changed by the value in <font color="blue">incmx</font><br />
      - [COLOR=blue]incmx/color] is changed by the value of the <font color="blue">incmx</font> minus <font color="blue">destmx</font>, all multiplied by <font color="blue">cmx</font><br />
      -<font color="blue">incmx</font> minus <font color="blue">destmx</font> gives how much <font color="blue">destmx</font> is greater than <font color="blue">incmx</font> (call it <font color="orange">diffmx</font> for convenience)<br />
      - devide <font color="orange">diffmx</font> by any value to get that fraction of the difference<br />
      <font size="1">eg.<br />
      mx=5<br />
      incmx = -2<br />
      destmx = 1<br />
      cmx = .2<br />
      <br />
      second frame:<br />
      mx=3<br />
      incmx = -2 + (1 - -2) * .2<br />
      incmx = -2 + 3 *.2<br />
      incmx = -2 + .6<br />
      incmx = -1.4<br />
      <br />
      third frame:<br />
      mx=1.06<br />
      incmx = -1.4 + (1 - -1.4) *.2<br />
      incmx = -1.4 + 2.4 *.2<br />
      incmx = -1.4 + .88<br />
      incmx = -.52<br />
      <br />
      fourth frame:<br />
      mx=-.54<br />
      and so on...<br /></font><br />
      - <font color="blue">distmx</font> is determined by a random number devided by the number of values to put it in the range [0]..[1], then shifted down by .5 so the range becomes [-.5]..[.5]<br />
      - <font color="blue">cmx</font> is determined by a random number, devided to make sur it isn't too big, then shifted up by 1 so there is no devision by 0, which can cause funky things to happen :wierd:<br />
      <br />
      ----------------<br />
      <br />
      I hope that helps. Just ask and I'll post the development preset (I still have a version with just the scrolling, no zoom or rotation) in the forums so you can DL it to get the visuals to go with.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps. :)<br />

      I'm still working on it, but I've made a few more I'd like to post here. One is a really old one I almost forgot I had, and the others are kind of chaotic.<br />
      <br />
      Please be sure to check out my earlier zip files with my other presets &amp; tell me what you think. As always, any suggestions, input, criticism, or other opinions are always welcome</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, the new ones.<br />
      <br />
      I liked meltaway superscope, eye spy, and AI. The others I found there was too much going on. Sometimes all they needed was a little more black and maybe a bigger linewidth. Others I have no idea.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>which ones</strong><br />
      Could you give some specific ones that you thought needed more black? I'd be very grateful if some of you guys would remix my presets to where you think they look better. Sometimes I just don't know what to do to them to fix them up.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I know it's a little early for 4th of July, but I've started making patriotic presets. Check them out &amp; please tell me what you think/remix them.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Please review previous presets :(</strong><br />
      :( :( :( Please Please Please take a look at my previous posts in this thread that include zip files of presets. Many of them have not received a single review, and some haven't even been downloaded. :( :(<br />
      <br />
      Well, I'll also include another zip file of different versions of the same preset. It originally looked much cooler, but I messed it up &amp; couldn't quite re-create it.<br />
      <br />
      Please tell me what you think :( &amp; review this &amp; my previous presets. I know there's a lot of you signed in right now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm... Mostly variations of the ones posted before. Dude, you don't have to run everything by people here. Do your own stuff, only you can make yourself better, not us.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, to the presets. Like I said above, most were variations of ones posted above. I saw them and thought something like "more of this". It's hard to come up with new meaningful reviews for prettymuch the same thing. I did like the smooth mix of colours 3, and the smoke and comets mix of 4th of July.<br />
      <br />
      You use the fireworks APE a fair bit. Try stepping away for it a bit. See whatelse you can use to inject color and fill space. You may surprise yourself.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>how's this?</strong><br />
      I've made something without the fireworks APE, like you suggested. I've been experimenting implementing u &amp; v variables, but I'm not quite happy with the results of my experimentation yet. I'll get back on this. Unfortunately, these are only remixes to old scopes of mine to make them do something new (like rotation/gyrating/etc). So they'll probably have the same old fireworks APE. But I'm still working on it :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry for bumping, but cmountford indirectly told me to review this preview pack in another topic (I haven't tried them yet)... Sides, I *think* that he *might* be a good AVS artist in development...<br />
      <br />
      Review for the original preview pack :<br />
      <br />
      Damn, a s***load of presets....<br />
      <br />
      K, detailed review... (I only review "final"s and some of non-finals)<br />
      <br />
      Weaving Trough a Spider Web : Yawn... Pretty much a chaotic (Chaotic, not dynamic!) SSC and screen filled up with the same color oftentimes.<br />
      <br />
      Alien Galaxy Extrapolation (Both versions) : A bit similiar to the preset above in some ways... Yawn?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Attempted Recovery (All versions) : Not again!<br />
      <br />
      Blinding Cydonia Rays : At last, a little break. Nasty effect on top half of the screen though...<br />
      <br />
      Chaz 3.5-4 : Eh? Quite boring, I must admit...<br />
      <br />
      Chaz 5 : <i>That</i> theme is already used quite a lot of times in the pack so far, don't you think?<br />
      <br />
      Chaz (UnConeD Edit) : A nice break from the theme, but quite similiar to his intro in overall look. I must admit though, the blue flame you managed to pull out is quite nice.... But then, it's simple color-exchanging.<br />
      <br />
      Chaz Parkinsophobic : Hmm, a break from the Chaz theme... "typical" preset.<br />
      <br />
      Chaz Psycho : Quite nice, but then, it's that simple on-beat colorfade randomize...<br />
      <br />
      Colored Laser Light : <i>Too</i> similiar to the Chaz 3.5-4.<br />
      <br />
      Entering Dimension of Pure Color : A "typical" preset.<br />
      <br />
      Eye Almost Perfected : Shize! THAT's a crapload of starfields! I attached my try of what you seem to want to create... (I never read/watched LOtR, so I don't know what Sauron is like...)<br />
      <br />
      Fountain of Life : Yawn?<br />
      <br />
      Freaky Tube Box Experiment : Not appealing, but it's obvious you've screwed around with SpiralGraphFun... Screw around some more if you want to learn - see what do which.<br />
      <br />
      Ghost in Another Dimension : At last, something that looks a bit nicer... Looks alot like Justin's Bumpaphobia though.<br />
      <br />
      Goblet of Life : Looks a lot like Freaky Tube Box Experiment...<br />
      <br />
      High G-Forces : Looks a lot like something I made when I was a newbie... Anyways, in #1 and #2, that flaw looks quite a bit familiar... Hmm...<br />
      <br />
      Journey Paranoya color.2 : One of the nicer presets... I think it have a little of Paranoya's style in there =)<br />
      <br />
      Journey Through Another Dimension : Well, it's a bit appealing, but that's about it...<br />
      <br />
      Oh jeez... It's 11:33 already? Man, I'm quite sleepy here...<br />
      I viewed some of the rest...<br />
      <br />
      Overall : 2.5-3 Stars. 3 most likely...<br />
      Now, if only you would <i><b>code</b></i>...</p>

      I can't believe you actually looked through my initial vault of...hmmmm? What about some of my newest presets, though? They're much better (but until you get fairly recent; they're all fairly similar). A lot of my first ones were originally just slight variations of the same thing :D. As you probably noticed.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>okay.</strong><br />
      I've been messing around with the idea from Drunken Smoking Flares. I've also been doing slight remixes to some of my old presets.<br />
      <br />
      I can't always tell if things I do to my presets really make a difference, so I include several versions. For those of you who've already seen the originals, please hold your peace about comments like...Oh no! Not again! That sorta stuff? If I can make a couple more **good** ones, then I've only got to pick the best out of the remixes to include in my AVS pack. Have any of you seen my old preset called Awesome 5.2.3? In case you hadn't, I'm including it in this zip. If you have, please ignore it. I haven't modified it or anything. It's still one of my all-time favorite AVS creations of mine. I made it long before I even before I got my membership in the forums. I still think it's awesome...lol.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I can't exactly tell whether or not is it better than the first preview or not... It's just a tiny bit better....<br />
      <br />
      Note : Awesome 5.2.3 looks like random stuff thrown together.<br />
      <br />
      Aesthetics : 3 outta 5 stars... You're, quite unfortunately, seems to be stuck there... Start to learn to code... It's the only way to get to the "great" 4-star level.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>go ahead and post them here, pls</strong><br />
      I just got back from the most fun week I've had all summer! Woohoo!!!<br />
      <br />
      Okay, down to business. I think this might be useful to other AVS artists stuck in the rut of not being able to get the effects they want, and wondering if we'll ever get good enough to make really cool stuff. Geez! It's been a long time since I've typed anything (I've been sailing all week). It seems hard all of a sudden.<br />
      <br />
      So in short, I think it'd be a good idea to post them in this thread.<br />
      <br />
      I always thought I'd have to wait until Calc before I got the explanation I needed to have a goal &amp; then figure out how to make it in AVS (code). I just hope this is more solving (like algebra instead of Geometry). I did okay in Geometry (93%), but I'm much better in Algebra (Algebra I grade was 98%).<br />
      <br />
      The more, the better! Thanks a lot.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Where to Start Coding for Dummies =)</strong><br />
      First, we'll start with movements. Stiff, plain, no dynamics (Ugh, I hate to say that first 3 words of the list....), but basic and easy to learn (Or copy, actually).<br />
      <br />
      I - First words<br />
      Ia - So, what things you could've done that makes you want to code?<br />
      ---- 1. Staring in awe of a masterpiece from one of the better AVS artists, then having a brain overload after looking at the coding involved.<br />
      ---- 2. Reviews of your presets said in one part, "Code!"<br />
      ---- 3. You just want to.<br />
      Ib - Hopefully, you read the AVS FAQ at the main AVS forum first. If you don't...<br />
      Ic - This part is useless, dontya think?<br />
      <br />
      -----------------<br />
      II - Basic Coding<br />
      -----------------<br />
      <br />
      IIa - Variables!<br />
      --------Yes, there are many variables - Despite the fact that you can see as much as 100 variables in a single preset, but guess what, most of them aren't even something that come with AVS! More than half of them would be custom variables. That's something you don't need to know if you're just starting coding.<br />
      --------So, what are the actual variables?<br />
      -D, for distance<br />
      -R, for rotation<br />
      -X, for... X axis<br />
      -Y, for Y axis<br />
      -The rest should be custom variables...<br />
      <br />
      IIb - Now the Basics<br />
      --------Where to start coding? Somewhere simple. Let's start with a simple zooming-in. It's simple, and easily substitutes Blitter Feedback. Don't forget that handy moving particle.<br />
      -The code is simple, and short : d=d/1.01;<br />
      -It's slow, but it's a start... want it to be faster? set it to a higher number! Note that 1.02 will make the zooming speed <i>twice</i> the current speed. Be careful, or you'll end up with... Something chaotic.<br />
      -You can also substitute the code with d=d-0.01; It's quite a lot faster, and it unfortunately adds a bubbling effect to it. Use it when appropriate... We're talking about plain zooming right now.<br />
      -Oh yeah, be sure leave bilinear filtering on and don't use "Clear Every Frame".<br />
      <br />
      --------Now that you zoomed in, let's zoom out!<br />
      -The code is... d=d*1.01;<br />
      -Not surprising, huh? It's simply the opposite of zooming in, so it just changes the division sign with the multiplication.<br />
      -You can also change the code with the - sign into a code with a + sign. Zooms out, but with a side effect too.<br />
      ==Math behind it? Just read the formula, and remember, d is distance.<br />
      <br />
      --------So you've zoomed in and out... Now rotate.<br />
      -R is rotation, so the code is simply r=r+0.05 or r=r-0.05;<br />
      -"+" goes anti-clockwise, - goes clockwise<br />
      -R doesn't cope well with "*" or "/". Don't use them.<br />
      -Use with combination of D for a zooming and rotating movement. You can easily replace the "Tunneling" movement with combination of D and R, AND make newbies think you're a coder... Well, possibly.<br />
      <br />
      --------Move left, move right, move up, move down.<br />
      -Now you'll learn simple x-y transition! Simplest thing in terms of math.<br />
      -Check the "Rect Coords" checkbox. Sounds weird, but it needs to be used to make them transition work.<br />
      -Simple X transition? x=x+0.01; or x=x-0.01;<br />
      -Replace X with Y for Y transition.<br />
      -Use combination of 2 at once for diagonal movement.<br />
      -You can use x/y with d/r movement in conjunction, but that would take some advanced coding... Sorry, but you'll have to wait for a bit till you're able to do such thing, which seems like a simple thing, but definately isn't.<br />
      <br />
      III - Dynamics!<br />
      <br />
      IIIa - Simple dynamics<br />
      --------Now, you get to play around with something more - The "Dynamic Movement". It's not named Dynamic for nothing.<br />
      -First of all, change the grid size. What's your AVS window size? It should be "AxB", A and B being the size in pixles. The grid size should be A/10 and B/10. Do the math yourself. This is done to prevent the DM's tendency to move the image slightly to top-left.<br />
      -The box you want to type in is the 3rd big box from the top, labeled "Pixel" or somwthing like that.<br />
      -Try the basic movements that I told you in the previous chapter. It works the same as a typical movement! Good, eh?<br />
      -One new variable : B. 1 on beat, 0 otherwise.<br />
      -So, wanna dynamics? Try this : d=d/(1.01+b/10)<br />
      -There! Now it got some nice beat-detection!<br />
      -BTW, you can substitute a black OnBeat clear by using the code d=d+b.<br />
      <br />
      --------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      Er, that's it for now. I can't stand typing long things... I'll continue this somewhen later. At most, tommorrow..</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>easy</strong><br />
      I understood that okay. So now, how do I get more advanced DMs? I mean in terms of math? That's what I thought I had to wait for more advanced math classes to get. Like the really cool stuff.<br />
      <br />
      BTW: Did you every check out my presets kaleidiscopaphobia and mirrors mirrors everywhere? And all the other movement presets in that group? Would that be considered coding? These presets will be in a zipped file in a thread a while back.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-time small text-muted">30th June 2002 01:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p>

      <p class="post-content">For "A few More", "Please Review", and "A few more goodies" : Most coding is in SSC, which is edited spiral graph fun... In Chaz Parkinsophobic... you made that? Doubtful. In Escape from longwordthingy... Type-away coding?<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, let's continue on.<br />
      <br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      IIIa (continued)<br />
      <br />
      -Mess around with the number after B. It sets the speed. The higher, the less the change (You can even make it slow down! Use - for that.)<br />
      -You can use R, X, or Y instead of D, too.<br />
      <br />
      IIIb - More dynamic!<br />
      --------Now, you get to do the real deal. It changes every beat. Hopefully you got spare neurons ready.<br />
      -Now you also get to tinker around with custom variables, and a function.<br />
      -For this one, let's start with a rotation. it's quite short, too.<br />
      <br />
      On the first box (Init) : (none)<br />
      On the second box (Frame) : (none)<br />
      On the third box (beat) : t=rand(401)/1000-0.2;<br />
      On the fourth box (pixel) : r=r+t;<br />
      <br />
      -Definition? It's quite as simple as r=r+0.01; but the "0.01" is replaced by a variable that changes its value every beat. So, one beat it can be 0.2, another 0.125, another -0.199, and even 0 in another one.<br />
      -rand spits out a number which is in range of 0 to the number in the pharantheses... in this case, it goes from 0 to 400.<br />
      -Rand is very random. It's linear-proof.<br />
      -Remember to use a beat-ty song to see the difference!<br />
      <br />
      -------Now let's implement this to x/y movement!<br />
      1st box : none<br />
      2nd box : none<br />
      3rd box :<br />
      tx=rand(401)/1000-0.2;<br />
      ty=rand(401)/1000-0.2;<br />
      4th box :<br />
      x=x+tx;<br />
      y=y+ty;<br />
      <br />
      Check "Rect Coords"<br />
      <br />
      -Happy? You should probably be. Satisfied? Doubtful.<br />
      <br />
      IV - More coding...<br />
      -------Getting to a bit more advanced stuff now. You're allowed to use typical trans/movement again now...<br />
      -Let's do a "simple" one for now, shall we?<br />
      -Code : d=d-cos(r*2)*0.01<br />
      -Note the movement, it's not zooming in. It's not zooming out. Confused? Shouldn't be.<br />
      -You can replace the number after the r with a lot of other numbers... it changes the number of "spouts" that exists.<br />
      -The math? Just think of a cosine wave. You'll get it someday.<br />
      -You can replace cos with sin. Only a location difference.<br />
      -Want to rotate it around? use +# or -# (# being a number) after r*2, still inside the pharantheses. The good part is, now you get to use big numbers!<br />
      -If you want to tilt it 90º, use +acos(-1)/2. Remove the /2 for 180º rotation. Acos(-1) (Arccosine of -1) is very damn close to pi. in AVS, r is 2pi, so 2pi is 360º rotation.<br />
      -Try d=d-abs(cos(r*2.5)*0.01)<br />
      <br />
      -------Let's move on to x and y again.<br />
      -Code? Let's try to use cos again!<br />
      -code :<br />
      x=x+cos(y*10)*0.01;<br />
      y=y+cos(x*10)*0.01;<br />
      -Now you've made a swirly stuff!<br />
      -Looks nice, and the number after x or y is the number of swirls. Play around.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>DMs</strong><br />
      Okay-here's the DMs I've made according to your advice. Some of them I included some of my own modifications (usually to make it more of what I consider "dynamic").<br />
      <br />
      BTW: I'm not sure whether I included the comment in the preset Parkinsophobic in the zip file in this thread. Be sure to check out my new thread called Final Draft AVS Pack. It has all the most current versions. In the most current version, I'm positive it has the comment saying it's a modification to one of Justin's presets (or one of the newpicks).<br />
      <br />
      What do you mean by "type-away coding?"<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">"Type-away Coding" Is non-coding coding... you just type the functions and operations without knowing what it do (Tho Variables is another story). I must admit, I used it few times =þ<br />
      <br />
      As for the presets...<br />
      <br />
      Direct copy? almost...<br />
      I attached a nice remix of the 4.2 one.<br />
      I must admit tho, the name is now getting <i>too</i> long...<br />
      <br />
      BTW, Haven't d/led the other one yet... Gonna go there afta this.</p>

      Classes? We don't need no stinkin' classes! I dropped calculus, and algebra-geometry. ('cause I was failing both :( ) Now I wish I'd paid better attention, but every thing you need you can find on the internet. Here's a good place. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/" target="_blank">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/</a><br />
      <br />
      Here's the all the stages of the moving kalidescope preset up to, including, and after the final cut. Feel free to mess, slice, dice, and do whatever with. Hope it helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>more DMs?</strong><br />
      when combined with r, t makes the DM rotate, right? And t1 is what stores values into the variable t every time there's a beat? It seems that t also controls the zooming in &amp; out effect. r alone doesn't seem to have much of an effect without t. And to make the rotation change direction you change t=t+t1 to t=t-t1 in frame. Or you could change the pixel value from +t to -t. So I could rename t1 "cat," or any other non-predefined variable, right?<br />
      <br />
      I think I understand everything so far. What's next?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again for your help. This is cool. :)</p>

      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      -------Now let's kick some movement presets outta the window.<br />
      -Tunneling. Easy to duplicate!<br />
      -Code?<br />
      d=atan(d*1.01);<br />
      r=r+0.05;<br />
      -There! You've duplicated one of the preset movements!<br />
      <br />
      -Slight Fuzzily. Not exactly hard to duplicate...<br />
      -Code, ye ask?<br />
      x=x+(rand(126)/10000-0.00625);<br />
      y=y+(rand(126)/10000-0.00625);<br />
      -Don't forget to (For the first time ever) disable Bilinear Filtering and enable rect coords.<br />
      -It's not complicated - Remember the rand function? Now we moved it into the Pixel part (The only part in movement, in this case), made it into a tiny movement, and subtracted by exactly half of it, so it scatters the image around every pixel.Different direction for each pixel too.<br />
      -So you've downed another preset. Be happy. There's still one more, though.<br />
      <br />
      -Shift Rotate Left. <i>very</i> simple.<br />
      -Code?<br />
      x=x+0.03;<br />
      Disable bilinear filtering, enable wrap.<br />
      -That's it...<br />
      <br />
      -Big Swirl Out. Another simple one!<br />
      -The code is...<br />
      d=d/1.04;<br />
      r=r+0.1*cos(d*3);<br />
      (Don't forget to disable the rect coords. I won't bother to tell you to enable/disable it from now. You know how it works, don't you?)<br />
      -The r function varies for each pixels' distance from the center one, behaving in a cosine-wave sort of way.<br />
      -Another easy one down! Want another one?<br />
      <br />
      -Sunburster! It's quite popularly used among newbies (Ouch), and is not as easy to duplicate.<br />
      -Code...<br />
      d=d/(1+(cos(r*32)/25)+0.1);<br />
      -Took me quite a bit longer to duplicate than other ones.<br />
      -Yes, I know, it doesn't <i>perfectly</i> duplicate it *sigh*<br />
      -Anyways, the number afta the r is the number of rays.<br />
      -For 5-pointed Distro, use the following slightly-edited code :<br />
      d=d/(1+(cos(r*5)/50)+0.05)<br />
      <br />
      -Swirling both ways at once. Long name, "short" code.<br />
      -Code :<br />
      r=r+sin(d*20)*0.1<br />
      -I still have yet to fix the purely visible edge between each direction of swirl... But it's not THAT visible, right?<br />
      -That was easy!<br />
      <br />
      -Sorry. That's all the preset movements you get to kick, folks!<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      Gonna continue this later...<br />
      Oh, And I get on converting those boring linear movements to DMs tommorrow.</p>

      Congrats on the senior membership. Thanks for the movement help. I started tinkering around with them almost as soon as you replied, but I've been busy messing around &amp; going to the movies with friends &amp; cool stuff like that. I just hadn't gotten around to replying yet.<br />

      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      IIIc - Combining Boredom and Freedom<br />
      <br />
      ------You've learned how to duplicate some preset movements, and they got boring quite quickly, does it? It's time to spice it up.<br />
      <br />
      ------Tunneling : Remember the random-rotation DM? Use it here, plus these lines of codes :<br />
      <br />
      Beat : dt=rand(101)/1000;<br />
      Pixel : d=atan(d/(1+dt));<br />
      <br />
      -Remember, adding dynamics to movements may be as simple as making a number change each beat/slowly over each frame<br />
      <br />
      ------Shift Rotate left... Just take random x/y movement, and omit the y part!<br />
      <br />
      -----Big swirl out...<br />
      -It now undergoes a plastic surgery... looks so much better, and might even make you feel like a professional ;)<br />
      -Code :<br />
      Beat :<br />
      dt=rand(101)/1000;<br />
      t=rand(201)/1000-0.1;<br />
      ra=rand(11)+5;<br />
      Pixel :<br />
      d=d/(1+dt);<br />
      r=r+t*cos(d*ra);<br />
      <br />
      -There! imagine that, 3 parts are randomized each beat - Zooming speed, rotation speed, and the "amount" of rotations.<br />
      <br />
      -----Sunburster<br />
      -Only a change... Rotating the rays around doesn't give much difference on higher amount of rays.<br />
      -Code :<br />
      Beat : ra=rand(16)+10;<br />
      Pixel : d=d/(1+(cos(r*ra)/25)+0.1);<br />
      <br />
      -The amount of rays is kept high so that the purpose of a sunburster is not gone. Unfortunately, it makes the change not very noticable too *sigh*<br />
      -Change the beat part to "ra=rand(15)+1" if you're making dynamic 5-Pointed Distro. Feel free to add a good rotation too (t=t+t1 on frame and t1=rand(401)/1000-0.2 on beat)(Add inside the cosine function)<br />
      -Enable the blend... I like it more that way =)<br />
      <br />
      -----Swirling Both Ways At Once<br />
      -The amount of swirl now changes! I made it able to jiggle and wiggle too ;)<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      Frame : t=t+t1;<br />
      Beat :<br />
      ra=rand(15)+10;<br />
      t1=rand(501)/1000-0.25;<br />
      Pixel : r=r+sin(d*ra+t)*0.1<br />
      <br />
      -The amount of "ra" is kept high so that the swirling-both-ways is visible... Lower numbers don't seem to swirl both ways very well.<br />
      <br />
      -----Implementing your knowledge<br />
      --What can you do with your newfound knowledge?<br />
      -More tinkering. This time, you know a bit more of what you're doing.<br />
      -Making kickass presets<br />
      -Making your first pack to be presented to the world make people think you're going to be a good AVS artist :p ;)<br />
      -Giving yourself satisfaction<br />
      -Not tearing your hair because not knowing coding.<br />
      <br />
      -Anyways...<br />
      <br />
      -----"Presets" that I Made<br />
      --Preset DMs! Not intended to be used as the only thing you use.<br />
      <br />
      -"Shifting Flower Flow" (I'm not good at naming)<br />
      Frame :<br />
      t=t+t1;<br />
      td=td+td1;<br />
      <br />
      Beat :<br />
      ra=rand(14)+2;<br />
      da=rand(14)+2;<br />
      t1=rand(501)/1000-0.25;<br />
      td1=rand(501)/1000-0.25;<br />
      <br />
      Pixel :<br />
      r=r+sin(d*ra+t)*0.2;<br />
      d=d+sin(r*da+td)*0.04;<br />
      <br />
      (Best when blend is on, offsetting the bad edges)<br />
      <br />
      -Whoops, did I say presetS? oh, whoops...<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      That's all for now. I think this is the final chapter for "trailer" DMs... Non-trailers are next (Either that or SSC)...<br />
      <br />
      When this is done, should I copy all of it and post it as a new topic? I mean, there's not many people viewing this topic anymore...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Okay</strong><br />
      Maybe you can give me some ideas on how to implement some new variables into the previous things we did. I liked your thing, and I have some ideas, but I'm not sure how to add them in smoothly.<br />
      <br />
      I *slightly* changed the swirling both ways at once...but I'd like to try to implement more variables into that one sort of like you had in the preset you made. (I was thinking about dt &amp; dt1 in particular).<br />
      <br />
      I think it would be a great idea to put this in a guide (as soon as I better understand it, I'll use what you taught me to write my own. I think it'd be great to post it as another thread. You might even run it by the mods, see what they say. Let's slow down just a little bit. I'll probably understand it as soon as I take a look at it tomorrow (my medicine had worn off at the time I looked at this).<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the help.<br />

      edit: For the name...if you've heard of moonflower DJ lighting (if not...go to <a href="http://www.pssl.com" target="_blank">www.pssl.com</a> and look up the "Electra"), if you could make a superscope to resemble a moonflower light, then I think you could name it "sempiternally fluctuating psychadellic moonflower love generator." Okay okay...I'm sorry if the writer in me is taking over. But it was just an idea. BTW: sempiternal is a real word...look it up at <a href="http://www.dictionary.com" target="_blank">www.dictionary.com</a> to see what it means.</p>

      please ignore the comment in my previous reply to slow down. :) My medicine does help a lot! I'd still like to figure out how to do the ideas I mentioned in my previous reply. But I'm ready for whatever you had next as well. So I'm ready for both. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Give the color wheel a spin</strong><br />
      I was wondering if I could use this preset I slightly modified of your remix in my AVS pack. Would that be okay with you? I'm calling it "Give the color wheel a spin." Reminds me of a somewhat melancholy song. "If you stand in the middle you can keep your balance...if you stand in the middle you won't fall down...etc." The song's about this space pilot who ends up a slave.<br />

      I'm not sure I made it very clear in one of my replies that I'm ready for more. I am officially ready for more coding work. :) SSC or non-trailer DMs are fine (it still would be cool to know how to add more variables to achieve a desired result by modifying a trailer DM. But it doesn't matter...I just want to work on some more coding! :)</p>

      IV : Morph the Image<br />
      <br />
      -----So you made a good lookin' preset... What's next?<br />
      -----NOTE : Work with a good BG that also nicely display morphing for this part. Simply add a good and FAST preset for that. Interleave with the buttons 4 steps from left works nicely too. White color, clear every frame, of course. Change the color to non-white color (Or a bright one) and add Bump for... umm... boundary tracking. Make sure it's set to bumpiest. Oh, and recommended code for bump :<br />
      <br />
      Pixel :<br />
      <br />
      x=0.5+cos(tx)*0.3;<br />
      y=0.5+sin(ty)*0.3;<br />
      tx=tx+Tx1;ty=ty+Ty1;<br />
      <br />
      Beat : tx1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;ty1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      <br />
      (It just makes it move randomly)<br />
      (Oh, and setting the DM's grid size to w/10 × h/10 is recommended... Since you can't punch in w and h, calculate yourself)<br />
      <br />
      -----Ready? Good! Type in "d=d*3" in the pixel section.<br />
      -It makes a simple movement (It's in DM, but who cares?)... but it can be made using Roto Blitter. Without the painstaking pixel-perfect setting, that is.<br />
      <br />
      -----Fine, you want something un-Roto Blitter like. Note that this is quite a leap from the previous code...<br />
      <br />
      Frame : t=t+0.1<br />
      <br />
      Pixel : d=d/(1+cos(d*10-t)*0.2)<br />
      <br />
      -There! A nice ripple!<br />
      <br />
      Change pixel to :<br />
      <br />
      d=d/(y+(2+sin(y*10+t)*0.1));<br />
      <br />
      And you get a Y-axis ripple with distance to the top.<br />
      <br />
      -----Dynamics? Why not!<br />
      <br />
      Frame :<br />
      <br />
      td=td+td1;<br />
      tr=tr+tr1;<br />
      <br />
      Beat :<br />
      <br />
      dd=rand(10)+1;<br />
      rr=rand(10)+1;<br />
      td1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      tr1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      <br />
      Pixel :<br />
      <br />
      d=d*(1+cos(d*dd+td)*0.1)*(1+sin(r*rr-tr)*0.1);<br />
      <br />
      Yes, a lot like that "preset" DM, but hey, translating 2d trailing movements to 3d depth (Distance translated in pixel = depth) have no guilt in it.<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, short edition today... Hopefully I'll continue tommorrow...<br />
      <br />
      It's 2:34 AM here... Gonna sleep... *yawns* The comp needs some rest too...<br />
      <br />
      BTW, if you want a "soft" interleave, add a slightly darker Clear Screen before it. The difference is clear when a bump goes on it.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>DM problems</strong><br />
      I just got back from vacation last night, so I'll be more active in the forums now.<br />
      <br />
      So what's all this you said about 2-D to 3-D? I've been looking at some webpages that have been talking about 2-D to 3-D stuff. So what exactly do you mean by your comments about 3-D?<br />
      <br />
      For a while, you confused me with that thing about interleave. I accidentally created a very freaky UnConeD Whacko AVS Pack IV type-effect. I don't remember off the top of my head what the name of it was. But it's on the other computer. I'm not sure if I posted a preset I remixed with your DM in your preset shifting flower flow, but it reminded me of Austin Powers because of the colors.. "Yeah baby, yeah!"<br />
      <br />
      I kind of want to start a thread with a subject "Yeah baby, yeah!!!" just to see how many people look to see what it is.<br />
      <br />
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
      Brain-snap!!! I've gotten off-topic<br />
      <br />
      Back to what I was saying...I was kind of thrown off for a while trying to figure out what you wanted me to start with for a preset, so I tried both, but I liked the ones I'm attaching in this zip file best.<br />
      <br />
      I've been trying for some time to try to figure out some way to make a randomly-changing, smooth rotation. Perhaps you could hint at what sort of thing I'm supposed to do to get a randomly changing, controlled rotation in the DM. You'll see the problems right away as to which two I tried to get to rotate randomly.<br />
      <br />
      I'm curious what's going to be on the menu next...in terms of coding. I'm hungry! :D<br />
      <br />
      Guess that's all for now---thanks again for all the help</p>

      <p class="post-content">CMountford, even with your hunger of coding, don't eat a programming tutorial book =)<br />
      <br />
      To tell you the truth, non-trail DMs are not exactly the easiest to make... A lot of the good ones takes complicated coding (*Stares at Duo, Degnic, UnConeD, El-Vis, and others*), and the simple ones can be as good, but not as "Spectacular". I'll dig up good simple non-trail DM =) Maybe tommorrow, I'm laughing my @$$ off at Somethingawful.com. But then, there's time.<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      IV (Continued)<br />
      <br />
      -----So you've made a (very) nice DM... Why not go a little simpler and try a simple rotozoomer!<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      Frame : td=td+td1;tr=tr+tr1;<br />
      Beat : td1=rand(401)*0.001-0.2;tr1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      Pixel : d=d*(2+sin(td));r=r+tr;<br />
      <br />
      Turn on wrap, of course!<br />
      <br />
      -So you made a rotozoomer... It's a classic effect! It doesn't quite replicate UnConeD's rotozoomer (On-Beat speed-ups, smooth rotation), but that can be done with more advanced coding. Not now, though.<br />
      <br />
      -----Since we don't want simple stuffs...<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      Frame : tx=tx+tx1;ty=ty+ty1;t=t+t1;<br />
      Beat : tx1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;ty1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25; t1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      Pixel :<br />
      x1=x+sin(tx);<br />
      y1=y+sin(ty);<br />
      z=sin(x1*2)+cos(y1*2);<br />
      x=x*sin(z+cos(z*(6+sin(t/2.5)*5)));<br />
      y=y*cos(z+cos(z*(6+sin(t/2.5)*5)));<br />
      <br />
      Another bulge-here-bulge there? Try this with the my recommended setting, then disable the interleave. Oh, and cranking the grid size up to 50x50 helps, too. What you have now is an overly shiny thing. Shiny, moves around, morphs... Something people can stare for hours =)<br />
      Why not use single D command, and use x and y? Using d makes an annoying trouble-area in the middle... we want good-looking preset... That troubled area is one ugly thing. We don't want ugly presets, do we!<br />
      <br />
      Ok, enough bulge this and bulge that. Time for something that's a bit less... bulgy.<br />
      <br />
      IVb - If Only I Master Coding...<br />
      <br />
      -----As in, "If" Commands. That command is not exactly easy to use, but is quite friendly once you know it.<br />
      <br />
      For starters, let's mirror!<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      <br />
      x=if(below(x,0),-x,x);<br />
      <br />
      -This is just like Trans - Mirror - Mirrored Right side to left side.<br />
      -Switch around -x and x for different side (Or change Below with Above).<br />
      -You can also replace x with y! Just make sure it's all x or y, or you'll get a serious distortion.<br />
      -No, don't use d or r.<br />
      -You can add the line of code at the very end of the DM to replace a Mirror. I don't know if it's less system-intensive than mirror or not, but it sure gives a more professional look (Look ma! no mirrors!)<br />
      -Yes, you can use X and Y together.<br />
      -"0" is the position. In X and Y, it runs from -1 to 1 (0 is the center). In D, it runs from 0 to 1. In R, it runs from 0 to 2*pi.<br />
      -You can type in more coding after "-x" and "x". You can replace "-x" with "x" (So both sides have "x") and type in a whole coding in each space! Edited part of the left "x" will do its stuff on the left side. Same with other part.<br />
      -In the pharantheses, you can change it between "x" and "y" to choose the "division" point.<br />
      -When using "d" for the part left of "=", never mind about not doing it - Just make sure you don't use "d" or "r" as the division point. You can make one side zoom in and one side zoom out! Imagine the possibilities! Such thing will make peoples' head hurt though =)<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      All for now. "If" command yields a lot of possibilities once you know how to do it, so explanation of "If" alone might keep you occupied for some time =)<br />
      <br />
      P.S. : Yes, you can make the division point dynamic! Make sure the "0" part is dynamic, not the "x" or "y" part.</p>

      Just so you know, I may not always reply, but I'm always ready for more :). So what's next?<br />
      <br />
      How exactly do you make one side zoom in and the other side zoom out? Some of the things you mentioned pointed out the possibility, so is that something I'm supposed to figure out? Guess I'll try to figure it out again</p>

      <p class="post-content">IVb - Continued<br />
      <br />
      -So, how do you make one of those odd effects? (Note : This is a trailing DM. Use multiple particles just for test)<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      <br />
      d=if(below(x,0),d/1.01,d*1.01);<br />
      <br />
      -There are many other possibilities... That's for you to figure out!<br />
      -You can also get a bit crafty :<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      <br />
      x=if(below(x,0),x/1.01,x*1.01)*if(above(y,0),1.01,0.99);<br />
      y=if(below(y,0),y*1.01,y/1.01)*if(above(x,0),1.01,0.99);<br />
      <br />
      -What about using the IF command on non-trailing DMs?<br />
      -Say, what's a better place to start than a "Dance Hall" effect?<br />
      <br />
      -Code :<br />
      <br />
      FRAME :<br />
      <br />
      tx=tx+tx1;<br />
      ty=ty+ty1;<br />
      <br />
      BEAT :<br />
      <br />
      tx1=rand(501)*0.001-0.25;<br />
      ty1=rand(251)*0.001-0.125;<br />
      <br />
      PIXEL :<br />
      <br />
      x=x/if(below(y,-0.2),-y+0.5,if(above(y,0.2),y+0.5,0.7))+tx;<br />
      y=y/if(below(y,-0.2),-y+0.5,if(above(y,0.2),y+0.5,0.7))+ty;<br />
      <br />
      -It's recommended that you remove "+ty" at the end of the Y line - It makes the Dance Hall effect <i>too</i> weird...<br />
      -As you can see in the code, we're using If inside If. yes, you can do that!<br />
      -This is a very simple form of a Dance Hall... The more complicated ones are definately more than 2 lines of code.<br />
      ______________________________________________________________________<br />
      <br />
      Err, I'll stop for now. Today's edition is quite short, but I have a reason : Should I continue with SSCs (Making the preset look good), or just continue with DMs?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>SSC</strong><br />
      How about we try SSC for a while? Should be a little easier to understand because they're just graphs. Trying to figure out equations for movements seems much harder because they---well---*move*! :)<br />
      <br />
      After we get some good superscopes maybe we can work on some much better DMs. (hopefully)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>do you have my most recent presets</strong><br />
      Yeah, a lot of my early presets were quite less than I would have hoped. The movement I repeated in a lot of my presets (if it's the one I think you're talking about) was quite a lot of trouble. My newer zip files should be much better quality presets (it stays kind of :P for a while, and then the quality IMO starts improving). Try looking at the presets in the .zip files after the quality of the presets starts going up. Don't forget to check out the questions that still haven't been quite answered (favorite gollum pictures is one question I have in mind) in my LOTR thread. Note that the newest version of Sauron's Eye is "Sauron's Fiery Eye.3" Use the link in my signature to find the thread---it's kind of buried underneath some of the newer threads.<br />
      <br />
      Here's the names of some presets that you should have if you've downloaded some of my better presets: Drunken Smoking Flares, DiscoDaFunk, (I can't remember if I ever gave the newest file in my ancient thread called "What is this?!?")<br />
      <br />
      My thread <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=92870" target="_blank">Final Draft AVS Pack</a> turned out to be NOT the final draft, so there'll be a lot of newer presets in this thread.<br />
      <br />
      I'll also attach a .zip file of just a quick selection of some of my favorite presets. I'm probably missing a few in this list (I've been messing around with NSIS and it kind of messed up some of my folders), but a lot of the newer-old ones should be in the .zip file (again...very newest most likely appear in this thread). I'm also including some of my messed up presets in development and experimentation stages---like the Hyperbola_____... series.<br />
      <br />
      You still might see a little bit of that line problem you mentioned, but I think the new variety should calm things down a little bit. Oh, yeah. I recommend making a separate folder for the files in the attached zip file. That way you can add some of my other new zip files without having to look at some of my older "not so good" presets</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reason that line appears is because 'r' is a cyclic variable (it represents an angle). So when you apply a square root or something else that's non-linear, the cyclic property is lost.</p>

      V : SUPERscopes!<br />
      <br />
      Va - Introduction to "super"scopes<br />
      <br />
      -----What? Superscopes? (SSC for short) Yes, the stuff that anyone can resort to if you're daunted by DMs. Yes, it's the stuff that makes ugly-looking presets that much better (IF you use it right).<br />
      <br />
      -----Why Superscopes? It's useless to have kickass environment if the texture is crappy. Superscope can accomplish this task of creating good texture (when coupled with the right movements, of course).<br />
      <br />
      -----Superscopes are a lot similiar in terms of coding with DMs, but there ARE differences...<br />
      <br />
      -The variables x,y,v,i,w,h are the only preset variables.<br />
      -No d, no r. You can use them as custom variables though...<br />
      -...Or you can customize them to act a bit like d and r from DMs. That's a whole other story though...<br />
      -You determine the location of points, it's a whole new game!<br />
      -Two different points in different locations make a line if you choose to render in lines.<br />
      -V is... Err...<br />
      --Take out Render-Simple, put in oscillioscope mode. It gives the value of the height of the line (Think of it as a coordinate graph, 1/2 top is 1, 1/2 bottom is -1/2). V does the same thing, except that it's twice the height (It now reaches top and bottom of screen)<br />
      --Make sure the selection you have near bottom is set to waveform, not spectrum to make this work. The Spectrum have a different way of numbering it.<br />
      <br />
      -i is...<br />
      --i have a different value among each point, a bit like V. This one, however, is linear (Yes, that's a good thing), and also is perhaps the most useful variable below x,y, and n (It's not a default variable, but required. More on that later).<br />
      --i goes from 0 to 1. The sequence is 0/n-1, 1/n-1, 2/n-1, ... , n-1/n-1.<br />
      ---n-1/n-1? The numerator is n-1 because the first number is 0, not 1.<br />
      --So, what is it used for? Wait for a few moments.<br />
      --What is "n"? it's next.<br />
      <br />
      -n is also an important variable. I didn't put it in the list for some odd reason...<br />
      --It determines the amount of the points the SSC have. The more, the more detailed. 100-500 should do until you get to the advanced SSCs...<br />
      --You should only need to define n in Init box until you get to advanced SSCs...<br />
      <br />
      -w is width of screen in pixels, h is the height in pixels. It won't be much use except for advanced uses (How many times have I said that?)<br />
      <br />
      -Enough talk, let's start!<br />
      <br />
      -----All superscopes (Well, hopefully) career starts with the simplest and most basic line of code... (Put in n=100 in the Init box first, you won't need to change it for a while)<br />
      <br />
      (Make sure you clean up the whole place first and set it to lines)<br />
      <br />
      -PIXEL : x=-1+i*2;y=0;<br />
      <br />
      --A line! It all starts here. A simple line. Of course, you'd want more!<br />
      <br />
      -PIXEL : x=-1+i*2;y=v/2; (Or y=v*0.5)<br />
      <br />
      --This one displays the music...just like Render-Simple!<br />
      ---More definition?<br />
      ---Here, x puts the dots from -1 (left side of screen) to 1 (right side of screen). i is multiplied by 2 to make it go all the way. This can be done with just 2 points, but those 100 points will be used later on. Sides, I want it to be convenient to you ;). y is the height of the dots, and it follows the same height as render-simple (halved because it goes with the REAL value!)<br />
      --n=w will make as detailed of a Render/Simple as you can.<br />
      --That, of course, shouldn't be enough to keep you satisfied. We always need more, do we!<br />
      <br />
      --Making a circle takes pi. You can always do pi=3.14whateverwhateverwhatever on Init, but there's a shorter way!<br />
      ---pi=acos(-1). A very indeginious equation (Yes, exagerated =P). It comes very close to pi!<br />
      ---22/7 works as well, but acos(-1) goes closer. I doubt you'll need it to go THAT detailed though, so it's ok to use it.<br />
      ---Now, put pi=acos(-1) on the Init section!<br />
      <br />
      -Circle!<br />
      -PIXEL :x=sin(i*pi*2);y=cos(i*pi*2)<br />
      --Why sin and cos? well, it's a long discussion and explanation... The whole explanation is available in Atero's AVS Primer. (Available at atero.deviantart.com [look at gallery]. You can also search for it, and you can even ask him personally for it [don't expect good reply, though...]. It also have explanations for WAAAAY many other things too! A must for beginners, I'd say...) (No, that wasn't sponsored by Atero)<br />
      --If your window is not square, add /w*h at the end of the x line. Just simple resolution correction, don't worry ;)<br />
      --You want a spiral? add *i to the end of both lines of code (I know they're at the same line, but let's just refer x as line 1 and y as line 2. You might want to change the number (As in, the non-variable number) inside the sin and cos to make more rotations done in the spiral. Just make sure the sin and cos numbers are the same. If the 2 are different, it makes interesting things, I admit (Also happens when there's no *i, too!)<br />
      --Circle... Not very exciting, isn't it?<br />
      <br />
      -PIXEL :<br />
      x=sin(i*pi*2)*0.5+v*sin(i*pi*2)*0.25;<br />
      y=cos(i*pi*2)*0.5+v*cos(i*pi*2)*0.25;<br />
      <br />
      -Aye, a music-detecting circle! The size is halved to show the whole thing better, and the v is quartered as a result first from halved for circle size, and halved for the usual halfing (hopefully you get what I mean).<br />
      -If you want a resolution-correction, get the whole x (Just the part after = and before ;, of course) in a pharantheses, and apply the res-correction)<br />
      -What? You don't care about music detection, and just want a cool stuff?<br />
      <br />
      -BEAT : tx1=rand(201)*0.001-0.1;ty1=rand(201)*0.001-0.1; (You can use /1000 instead of *0.001. *0.001 is slightly faster, and it became a habit for me)<br />
      FRAME : tx=tx+tx1;ty=ty+ty1; (The variables can be anything, just like DMs, you should remember that. In fact, you can make the variable cusswords... but we AVS artists are civilized [Or at least I hope so], and it gets quite sore on the eyes when it comes to editing)<br />
      PIXEL : x=sin(i*pi*2)*0.25+sin(tx)*0.75;y=cos(i*pi*2)*0.25+sin(tY)*0.75;<br />
      <br />
      --A circle that moves around! Yay!<br />
      --Res-correction should be put before the +sin(tx). If you want the place the circle is kept in to be square to, apply pharantheses to the whole thing and do the res-correction.<br />
      --To make it detect music too, add +v*sin(i*pi*2)*0.125 at the end of each line (Change sin to cos in y line)<br />
      --The movement is reduced to keep the circle in screen.<br />
      --If you had a spiral (refer to a previous section) and want it to rotate, you can add a random-on-beat number (Like tx-tx1 combo) and add it inside both sin and cosine. It doesn't do much in normal circles unless the number inside the sin and cosine are different.<br />
      <br />
      --Remember "If" from the last section of DMs? You can also use it here. Since you can't use big whole numbers, you'll either have to use decimals or the line p=n*i-i in pixel section (p=p+1 in pixel with p=0 in frame section will also do, and I think it's faster). After adding that line, what "p" will signify is the number 1 up to n, and the number is the number of the point! (As in, point #1, point #2, etc). This way, you can make several dots floating around, all in 1 SSC! If you use lines, it gets quite ugly, but there's where colorcoding comes in...<br />
      _______________________________________<br />
      <br />
      I'll stop here. Next stop is colorcoding, then more scopes, then perhaps 3D scopes.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully this will hold till tommorrow...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nic01: I saw you were in the forum, and I was just hoping for some more AVS guide stuff. Here's a preset I made on the laptop yesterday. I'll get my big computer hopefully back by tomorrow. I had a few presets on it I was debating whether to release or keep them secret and wait until I make them really cool. (oops! I just told you!) :D<br />
      <br />
      Pls tell me which version of the preset you like best</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>pi=acos(-1). A very indeginious equation (Yes, exagerated =P). It comes very close to pi!</b>
      </blockquote>cos(pi)=-1 so acos(-1)=pi, it gets as close to pi as your computer can get.<br />
      <br />
      I expect you knew that but reading that 'tutorial' it sounded like you thought it was just a good approximation.
