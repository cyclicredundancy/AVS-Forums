      <p class="post-content">Hmm... I was hoping for a bigger responce. Bad timing? Exams? I dunno. Well, thanks for the reply Montana. I assume that by simple ones you mean 'waterbugs' and 'missile swarm' + their remixes. (I like the hyperspace mix)<br />
      <br />
      Ah well... atleast two people have downloaded it now... maybe the means I'll get another review.:D</p>

      I don't know why I just waited until now ti d/l it... anyways...<br />
      <br />
      Overall : 3/5.<br />
      <br />
      Originality : 3/5<br />
      <br />
      Nothing's exactly revolutionary, and heck the SSCs from "Escaped Superscopes" seems like Marco's "Science of Superscope"...<br />
      More remixes than originals, too.<br />
      <br />
      Aestethics : 2.5/5<br />
      <br />
      Some are slightly trippy, some are boring (sorry), some are... average. They all cancel each other out rather nicely.<br />
      <br />
      Completeness : 3/5<br />
      <br />
      Not a big pack - but more Rmxs than originals is... weird (except if it's an all-rmx pack).<br />
      It does provide a rather nice variation of presets... not quite enough to bump it to 4/5 tho.<br />
      'Sides, some of the presets look almost the same (Take inverted remixes).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Suggestion :<br />
      <br />
      For the originals, add more and add quality =)<br />
      For the remixes... try to give a somewhat drastic change (Underwater rmx - Only AVS Artists will prolly notice the difference)<br />
      For examples of great remixes... look around this sub-forum. Lots of good remixes 'ere.<br />
      For originals, again : All complicated SSCs + DM,DDm,M are made step by step. To decode the bigger DMs other great artists made, look step by step - Don't get overwhelmed. You can learn about stuffs kinda better this way. Most of my AVSs' DMs are simple as heck<br />
      (You've DL-ed my pack right? Look at "Marble Floor" (Use Fast Brightness x0.5 if necesary), look at the DM (Not the alphablenders), and look at it step by step. It's just a simple movement-OnBeat randomizer.<br />
      <br />
      (Suggestion's overall : Learn, buddy. Try to make better RmXs, too)<br />
      <br />
      Good Luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, it would be kind of hard to review yours if I didn't DL it. :p<br />
      <br />
      Constructive criticism is good. It's the only way to improve (well, aside from practice :) ). All I ask is an honest review, no need to be sorry.<br />
      <br />
      btw, my superscpes are alot simpler than marcos.:p</p>
