<br />
Water Bugs-I used to make presets like these when I first got started... Sorry, but this is just too simple. Moving particles are a good base, however. Add some dynamic movements (DM is what makes or breaks most presets these days) and experiment. The biggest part of making a good preset is to have it look like noone elses (hell of an undertaking now). Also, try adding a movement at the botom (d=-d), make sure it's blended, this works much better than the mirrior effect in this situation if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Lines-Again too basic. It does look kinda cool with low sine wave synth sounds. It might be a good start to add a DM that makes the bars move in an undulating manner. As before, just experiment.<br />
<br />
Water Beat 1/2-I was never a big fan of the water bump. It's never been changed since the first release of AVS (they could at least add bilinear filtering) and it doesn't seem to effect the pixels on the edges of the window. I don't really think this one's going anywhere, too blocky and not enough going on.<br />
<br />
Pinwheel-I think everyone has made one of these before. I could never really get much more out of this idea than you have right here. There is no need for the effct list, by the way.<br />
<br />
In Too Deep-Getting better, but try to make it more dynamic. I'd suggest moving the particle above the blitter feedback.<br />
<br />
Starburst-Very simplistic, not to say it's bad, I actually like it, but it won't win any awards. Spice it up. I also like it better without that blur.<br />
<br />
Whirlpool-I'd add a irror to get rid of that asymetry. Same as usual dynamic, experiment. I must sound really annoying by now.<br />
<br />
Bug on Water- That's a pretty cool blending effect, now do more with it. Never be satisfied with your work, or it'll never get better. Learn as much as you can about blending and effect lists, they can be just as important as DMs.<br />
<br />
Water Bugs 2-When remixing any preset make sure it makes a big difference. It can be one effect or variable, as long as it makes a very noticeable difference.<br />
<br />
Simple- Add an additive blended unique tone to make the green line more visible. I don't sugest you continue with this one unless you intent to really alter it. I mean, I could have just loaded the simple effect and gotten almost the same thing.<br />
<br />
Wild- Good, but.... ahhh, you know.<br />
<br />
Windblown- I like the idea for the movement, but dynamic, blah, blah, blah. I also don't think that the blinear filtering isn't neccissary.<br />
<br />
In the end I'd say you just need to learn more, try not to be too hasty in releasing your work scrutinise it, and scrutinise it well.<br />
BTW, I was'nt as good as you my first two days. I'm just shocked you didn't have Winamp earlier. Shows how much I trapped in my own little world.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lol, thanks. I posted so i could get some criticism (and show off of course XP)<br />
<br />
The mirror suggestion on one of them definetly helped it. <br />
<br />
I dont know what bitlinear or whatever is... I dont see much of a diffrence.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Simple&quot; one i made to try to emulate the simple one on windows media player, because for some songs i really like that. I used two thinks on it to make it stand out more, i didnt like what it looked like with just a Render/Simple thing. <br />
<br />
I made a couple more, some of them look pretty nice. I figured out how to mirror stuff more then just with Trans/Mirror (using dynamic movement thing... r=r*numberofmirrors) its not exactly a mirror, but it makes the image more symetric. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the advice/criticism.</div></div><hr />
