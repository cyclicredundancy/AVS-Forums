<div class="posttext">It was a (purple?) 5 or 7 sided leaf shaped thingy that rotated and spun around the middle of the screen ot the beat, with 2 linear scopes on either side of the screen.  Ring any bells with anyone?  I had it installed before I redid my system, was part of a avs pack that I liked, but I'm not sure which one it was.  Going through every avs there is seems to be a last resort, so I thought I'd ask here.<br />

<div class="posttext">Raz, next time please don't encourage n00bs to seek answers like this in these forums. I mean, we are already swamped by the &quot;AVS IS SLOW!!!&quot; &amp; &quot;STOP CHANGING OF PRESETS!!!&quot; posts by now. If you add the &quot;DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PRESET WAS?!?!&quot; posts to it, there will be no more room for good &amp; constructive posts.<br />
<br />
And Necromaedian, the AVS forums shouldn't be used to seek presets that you already have but can't find! You need to just seek out them yourself! Don't come here and post something this pointless, it annoys the hell out of the regular forum members.<br />
<br />
Did i sound bitchy? GOOD! Some common sense people! Please?</div></div><hr />
