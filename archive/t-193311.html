      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS and Text/Image</strong><br />
      I'm part of a concert in two days time (<a href="http://www.eclecticbit.com" target="_blank">www.eclecticbit.com</a> - techno:centric // musicians plugged in), and I am hoping to use an AVS plugin for a background in some of the works.<br />
      <br />
      What i'd Really like to do is impose over the top of it, the text techno:centric // musicians plugged in in the appropriate fontage for the concert.<br />
      <br />
      Ideally, I'd like to be able to use something like PowerPoint and arrange text like I was arranging it for a black background, with the AVS in place of it. While that works great for static images, I don't know about the technical feasibility of doing this with a real-time visualisation.<br />
      <br />
      So would anybody have any suggestions as to how I could go about putting the logo of the concert over the top of the visualisation?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've worked out a solution - I've placed AVS into overlay mode, and then set Powerpoint to the background colour which acts transparent - so that when the slideshow is playing, instead of the solid colour, the background is replaced by the visualisation. Very cool.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice idea :)<br />
      <br />
      I would have suggested a fixed effect list after the end of each preset that had the title in it, but that would be a small fps drain whereas your idea is not.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Because it's not in fullscreen mode, the thing runs a lot faster - excellent for a laptop without a great graphics card or processor.<br />
      <br />
      Only problem is that I can't control the visualisations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">control them how? If you want them to change between only a few presets, put those presets in their own folder and tell avs to only use the presets in that folder instead of the main one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Positive thing here is that blendmode also blurs away the pixels a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Wasn't there some external plugin for manually switching presets? Try searching for it. (not sure)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well if you can get a video mixer? Or a titler?<br />
      <br />
      The other way to do it is make images at the screen res you are using. Then use ACDSee (an image viewer) to select and sequence them.</p>
