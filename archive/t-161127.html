      I can't understand your logic behind wanting the newpicks from 3 over 5 but if you must, re-download winamp 3 <a href="http://www.1001winampskins.com/download_winamp3.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, the newpicks for winamp5 are more oftenly preferred over those of winamp3, but if you like the basic effortless crap that is "the newpicks of the version that FAILED MISERABLY", go nuts....</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are some nice ones in the old newpicks. No reason in denying that. Though I think that generally most people will prefer the new newpicks. As for that people can have their own taste, I won't deny that one. :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Depends if your talking about mass visual appeal or what the hardcore AVS'ers like. I think the old newpicks had more mass appeal, but WA5 stuff is more techy and probably more appreciated by the devoted crowd.<br />
