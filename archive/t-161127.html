<div class="posttext">Use words, typing/speaking like that just makes you look like a complete prick. Just some friendly advice.<br />
<br />
I can't understand your logic behind wanting the newpicks from 3 over 5 but if you must, re-download winamp 3 here (http://www.1001winampskins.com/download_winamp3.html).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yes, the newpicks for winamp5 are more oftenly preferred over those of winamp3, but if you like the basic effortless crap that is &quot;the newpicks of the version that FAILED MISERABLY&quot;, go nuts....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Some people like the other stuff.  Nothing wrong with that.  Besides, not a lot of 5 Picks have super-high FPS.  Just something to consider.</div></div><hr />

gotta agree on that.. and weren't there even presets from duo and el-vis in the newpicks?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There are some nice ones in the old newpicks. No reason in denying that. Though I think that generally most people will prefer the new newpicks. As for that people can have their own taste, I won't deny that one. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Depends if your talking about mass visual appeal or what the hardcore AVS'ers like. I think the old newpicks had more mass appeal, but WA5 stuff is more techy and probably more appreciated by the devoted crowd.<br />
<br />
Except Nic.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">im not going to complain about the new newpicks, after all, it was up to us to pick them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The new newpicks suck cos I'm only in one preset... and its remix.<br />
<br />
Its not just sarcasm... I'm really bitter about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th December 2003, 04:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah that does suck a little. I've not released a single pack and i've got a remix in there. And your presets own mine a large ammount of times over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">without commenting it, here are those default presets of winamp 2 and winamp 3</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I only worry that the advanced presets may scare new potential AVS'ers off... For the next WA-version, perhaps both could be mixed.. Like WA5 basic presets/WA5 Advanced presets or so</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The other thing about the WA5 picks is that I like skupers and everything but BaJeZus what percentage of the WA5 picks are his?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Approx. 95%<br />

Most of his are also remixes of other people's presets.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">lol, but who cares? they're good. A lot of great presets are released in packs already, and not wanted in the Winamp 5 picks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">They all look very nice and I can really only find one I don't like, (his remix of  jhriko's(sp) bendy tunnel), but I would have prefrered(sp) a little bit more variety since it ended up being basically just a Yathoso pack, :).</div></div><hr />
