      <p class="post-content"><strong>Fullscreen isn't fullscreen</strong><br />
      First of all, yes. I have set the vertical height to 100%. That isn't the problem. The problem is that when I set fullscreen mode to, let's say 400X300X32, I end up with a box that doesn't fill the whole screen. The animation is fine, but it is surrounded by a large, black border.<br />
      It seems like it fails stretching the animation to fill up the entire screen or something... Or maybe it's picking the wrong reolution..<br />
      <br />
      What to do?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you tryed bps overlay in the fullscreen setting.<br />
      I find it to be effective when i get that problem.<br />
      <br />
      Another solution would be to use a larger resolution because 400x300x32<br />
      is like trying to put 1000 ping pong balls into a 5in x 8in in a box.<br />
      <br />
      mainly the lower the resolution the faster but in somecases it causes major distortion and aspec correction issues.<br />
      that and did you see if your aspect correction setting was correct?</p>
