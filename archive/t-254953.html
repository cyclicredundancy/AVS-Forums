			<strong>Nominating featured presets...</strong><br />
		
		

		There is a sticky at the top of the forum about nominating featured presets. I'm curious as to if this worked and if its dead.<br />
<br />
I vaguely remember a nominations thread and poll... was it ever acted upon?<br />
<br />
Also, if its a dead idea, can someone (UnConeD :p) please remove the sticky.<br />
<br />
Also, if its not dead I would like to nominate Jheriko - Pack 9 :p

		I was wondering about that too earlier.<br />
<br />
I've kept track of the featured packs and found that the listed packs, as wel as newly published quality packs, will be featured. All for a period of 2 weeks - each week one pack is replaced by another one.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious about what'll happen if all of the listed packs have been featured and the submission rate stays as low as it is now.<br />
<br />
I think we may to extend that list and post more suggestions, but that's just my idea and I'm not a reviewer. <br />
Doggy Dog, if you read this - what's your opinion?<br />
<br />

		Shortly after the poll was closed I found that my deviant art page was flooded with pageviews.  So was amphirion's.  I assumed it was spawned from people somehow getting to the page via all the new downloads from being featured at Winamp.  So in that regard, yes, it did work.

		Back...<br />
<br />
Well, right now, I'm damn busy with exams. We have a list here, and I'll add some more good recent packs to it to keep things going untill I have the time for another preset nomination...<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's just say that I'll probably have to FedEx my index to Sweden because one of my professors forgot to sign it, and returned there (I forgot to remind her), and that I still don't know when I'm going to have one of the exams... and I'm supposed to be done with everything till the 1st of October.

		Cool. I don't know why but I developed the impression that the 'featured packs' thing had faded into obscurity. I guess I was wrong... which is cool.
