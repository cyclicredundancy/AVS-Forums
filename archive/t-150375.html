<div class="posttext">I would like to ask if there is such a thing as an AVS selector plugin.  (So far I have only used Winamp 2.)  The plugin I have in mind would provide the user the ability to cycle through his/her AVS presets according to a selection menu and a selectable duration (e.g., 45 seconds each).  Thus you could audition presets and, when you like them, add them to your &quot;slide-show&quot; selections.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I am asking this and it is already in Winamp 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">First of all, there is a built in function that will switch randomly through a selected folder after a selected time.<br />
<br />
Then, there is are two overhead controlers that provide you with lots of additional possibillities, such as creating avs-playlists and much more.<br />
<br />
These two are:<br />
-AVS-Playlister<br />
-Hotlist<br />
<br />
To find AVS-Playlister, please search the Forums or pm Goebish (i lost the URL)<br />
To get Hotlist, just click my sig. :)<br />
<br />
Just try both and find out which one's better for your needs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Major Dude,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the speedy info!  But I would like to ask, after going to the Hotlist site, is Hotlist for both Winamp 2 and 3, or just one of these?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="posttext">It should work with avs, no matter which Winamp version you run.<br />
<br />
But i got 1 report that it did'nt work with wa3.<br />
<br />
So keep on using 2.91, ts newer and better. Wait for WA5, this one should unify the advantages of 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Advantages of wa3? Isn't that a oxymoron? :p</div></div><hr />

I tried Hotlist, but I need to ask, how do you turn it on? It installed okay in Win 2k.  But there doesn't seem to be a button to tell it to start sending commands to AVS.<br />
<br />
I am trying to see if it is possible to capture the music and video to a video file, but AVS Grabber captured only 22 seconds of soundless video.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS Grabber does'nt record music.It only turns AVS to AVI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Also I tried to install AVS playlister but it would not install into W2k; I suppose it is only good for W98, which I can also try it in.<br />
<br />
Regarding Hotlist, I would have assumed there would be some instructions on how to use it, as in a help file or an accompanying text file. At least in W2k, the help file doesn't appear when I select help. Could you please add or fix this, Magic.x?  I am not sure how to get it going once installed. I tried pushing every button!<br />
<br />
If it is automatic in some way, I should add that the only thing unique about my system is that I have multiboot, with W98/W2k/W2k in separate partitions, and with more than one installation of Winamp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It works as following:<br />
<br />
Open your avs folder.<br />
Use drag &amp; drop to add some prests to your list.<br />
Click them or activate automatic mode to lode them.<br />
<br />
You will find the readme within the hotlist folder, so you can open it manually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">And the names are not Major Dude's, that are the ranks ;). I would recommend Hotlist above AVS-Playlister though.</div></div><hr />
