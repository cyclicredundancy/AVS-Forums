i guess you're referring to the visbot archive (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=135793&amp;highlight=archive). it was online until september 2003 and featured all presets submitted to deviantart (http://visualization.deviantart.com) in 2001. since i have only 8gb of traffic/month, i had to take it offline.<br />
<br />
it appears, that deviantart no longer has devpacks, a while ago i made devpacks collection all presets the site has. but then again, i guess most of them were lost in that big server-crash  last years.<br />
<br />
deskmod (http://www.deskmod.com) has this basket-feature. you can add all the presets you want into it and then download on zip file with your selection. unfortunately the feature is currently not available. also it's no longer the premier avs site, as it used to be ~2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I doubt you want every single avs preset ever made... about 85% of them would be standard n00b shit (no kidding there is a lot more water+simple+rotoblitter=TrIpOuTPaRTy!!! presets than good quality avs work)<br />
<br />
Just go to the components and/or plugins section and download the best 50 avs packs or so and you're good to go for a loooong time.</div></div><hr />

Here are the direct links...<br />

winamp 2 -&gt; plugins -&gt; avs (http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/browse.jhtml?searchTerm=&amp;categoryName=AVS+Presets&amp;offset=0&amp;howMany=20) <br />

winamp 3 -&gt; components -&gt; avs (http://www.winamp.com/components3/browse.jhtml?searchTerm=&amp;categoryName=AVS&amp;offset=0&amp;howMany=20)<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason why there is less wa3 avs is because winamp3 is newer :rolleyes: But for avs's sake it really doesn't matter which winamp you use, avs is the same for both of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are AVS presets the best visualizations on the scene, or is there another software that beats it? I've seen alot and to me it looks like it's the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I am really confused by your question.<br />
<br />
AVS has the most variety, etc by far.<br />
<br />
Most people will agree that others have 'better' graphics but they are just limited in scenes.<br />
<br />
and really each decent pack will have like 20 presets you have not got to download that many packs to get a decent selection.<br />
<br />
For what you want for you mates club it my well be the best solution. <br />
<br />
ANd if you are not going to ask for permission from everyone at least give credit (thanks to the following artists/authors could pop every half and hour or so), etc for the stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow Rova, a reply to a &quot;Best plugin&quot; post and not a single word of about MilkDrop to be found, i say, im impressed :)<br />
<br />
Anyway AVS is all about variety &amp; more important the community. Other plugins beat avs 10 to 1 when it comes to a) Speed (the framerate) b) High resolutions without loosing that speed.<br />
<br />
So it's just up to you, do you want to watch cool graphics in high resolutions and with high speed, but the backdrop is that there isn't much variety. Or do you want to watch the tens of thousands different colored, styled, differently reactive AVS presets :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th September 2003, 08:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">now that's an easy question: both! I also love watching 3D Benchmarks as well. Though I do not recommend 3D plugins for AVS, there're way better things in this world. As for AVS: That's just plain holy goodness. The variety is unknown. The only other program that has this much variety is Windows Paint. And avs is way better than that :)</div></div><hr />
