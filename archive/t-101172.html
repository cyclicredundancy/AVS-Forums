			<strong>Submitting AVS presets</strong><br />
		
		

		All right, here's the info I need:<br />
<br />
Where can I find a program (such as SuperPIMP) that will allow me to create an installer file so that I can submit my AVS presets to the Components page? I can't submit ZIP files, so I need to create an EXE.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

		The Winamp page, or the Nullsoft page.

bit vague?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a direct link to the Nullsoft SuperPIMP page..<br />
<br />
although if you find it difficult to use you can always make self extracting .exe with winzip out of your existing .zip file.

		With NSIS (the Nullsoft installer) there is a ZIp2EXE converter that you can use which is better and recomended compared to a Zip self installer.<br />
<br />
Run NSIS compiler mode as BZIP as it will probably create a small exe too.

			<strong>Well, thanks again!</strong><br />
		
		

		Well, I've finally created the EXE installer with the NSIS ZIP2EXE tool, and uploaded it to my compnents page. Now I just have to wait for it to be reviewed.<br />
<br />
Wish me luck...<br />
<br />

		good luck, but don't expect a quick review it seems to take ages for them to review things... probably 'cos of winamp 3. another thing, its also much better to create a proper script for nsis rather than using the zip2exe thing since you can include a lot more options, for instance you could create an installer that works on both winamp 2 and winamp 3

		Well, my AVS presets wer ecreated using the version of AVS that came with 2.80, so until there's an interpreter component that lets you run 2.x AVS routines in 3.0, I'm still going to use 2.80.

		you do realise that avs is backwardly compatible.. if it wasn't then then someone needs to be shot for it, all my avs presets work fine on 3.0 and some of the were made on 2.8, 2.7 and previous versions.<br />
<br />
here's something you might find handy, an nsis script for making installers to both winamp2 and 3 in one, it might not be the best method (since it won't let you install to both at once) but it works:<br />
<br />
Name &quot;title bar content&quot;<br />
Icon &quot;icon for installer.ico&quot;    ;can be left out for default icon<br />
OutFile &quot;myavspackinstaller.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
InstallDir $PROGRAMFILES\Winamp<br />
<br />
DirText &quot;Please enter your full Winamp path below.&quot;<br />
<br />
ComponentText &quot;Please choose the version of Winamp that you wish to install to:&quot;<br />
<br />
InstType &quot;Winamp 2&quot;<br />
InstType &quot;Winamp 3&quot;<br />
InstType /NOCUSTOM<br />
<br />
AutoCloseWindow false    ; i always use these cos i like them :)<br />
ShowInstDetails show     ; they are not necessary tho'<br />
<br />
Section &quot;-&quot;<br />
SectionIn 1 2<br />
SectionEnd<br />
<br />
Section &quot;Pack for Winamp 2&quot;<br />

	SetOutPath $INSTDIR\Plugins\AVS\<br />

<br />

<br />
its pretty simple to use and change. file1.ext and file2.ext could be bmps or apes used in your pack, the scripts use wildcards as well so you can chuck a whole dir of avs into the installer easy enough. the first section is blank since there needs to be a required section and since there aren't any files to be copied for both wa2 and 3 installs it is left blank, you could use this section to install a readme to the desktop using the $DESKTOP path. just thought you might like to try it out...

		Finally! Last I saw, they hadn't implemented backwards support.

		they haven't implemented it cos it was there from the start, winamp3 avs is the same as winamp2 avs almost exactly, i have only found one preset in all of mine which i made in winamp2 which has a piffling little bug in it, trust me it is backwardly compatable.

		Last I saw, they were implementing a component that would allow you to use 2.x visualizations with 3.0...then again, maybe they mean stuff like those dancing girl things (which, in my opinion, are more useless than a computer with a crashed OS and faulty RAM).
