<div class="posttext">I know this may sound stupid I searched for an answer.. I ( today ) uploaded a compilation package of everything I liked up to 12.31.06..<br />
<br />
Its all credited to all of the guys in here of course..<br />
<br />
Thing was I submitted it as a RAR file.. and then thought 'Ya know I should be using an installer like all the other guys..'<br />
<br />
Thing is I don't write programs and have never really had the need to learn this but would like to in case I need it like in this instance..<br />
<br />
The rar file I submitted works great and includes 312 avs files.. You have to extract it to the avs folder in winamp..Total size is 18 MB after extraction..3.12 MB before<br />
<br />
I just see it as a more user-friendly method of install..<br />
As simple as it is there will always be that one time it doesn't work ya know.. so..<br />
<br />
If you guys can help it would be cool</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am assuming you would like an installer for your compilation. If this is the case then indeed there is a user-friendly installer: Pimpbot (http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/).</div></div><hr />

Private Compilation 2006 (http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/privatecompilation2006.exe) 12.31.06 Avs Rar File (http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/01.02.07avs.rar) <br />
<br />
I selected alot of these and critiqued them all year then with the update and change for version 5.32 I had to make more adjustments..<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.. I believe I may have to clean it up once more.. It seems to have grabbed a file that was put in the avs folder which is an avs.. ( My fault ) and i need to redo the installer .. It is supposed to install one folder called Visualizations..So that they could all be referenced and ran randomly for hours..<br />
<br />
I tested it running it for 48 on end with no glich.. so I have high hopes..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would like to add that yes the installer is incredibly user-friendly!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The link has been updated.. I managed to get it the installer fixed however, I found a little error in the program itself..<br />
<br />
I tried to upload a thumbnail into the installer, and also tried to use a wave file.. the wave file was huge .. so I removed it ( 38.5MB Dj Set cut :igor: ) I received an error with just trying to upload the image but instead of telling me the image was too large it kept saying that the Wave file was too large..Which at this point the installer had been restarted, and the wave file never entered..I used an old Icon for the file which worked great and hopefully I have the directory corrected now..:) So the link above is still good just updated ..It just makes me unsure..LOL<br />
<br />
I would feel better off if I had a clean WinAMP installation on a computer and was testing it there..<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">One more little issue..<br />
<br />
The dir that I thought I have repaired, is not.<br />
<br />
I selected the folder in which the presets reside in. However upon install they are all put directly into the avs folder instead of creating 'Visualization' folder.. this is great for getting better randomization.. but .. It may cause an issue with individuals who use individual folders to separate the various collections.. and I would prefer not to make a mess of someone's computer...without warning...easy for me to fix but the average computer user may find that extremely annoying to have three pages of AVS to choose from instead of being able to select a folder..I tried to select the previous folder hoping this would fix the problem but it did not, in fact like the first one I made it showed a size of 234 KB and actual required space which includes them all is like 12.8 MB or so..<br />
<br />
Is there a way to work around this without me learning 'NSIS' scripting? Or is there an error with this installer...<br />
<br />
I have it submitted ...<br />
<br />
Confused..:weird:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">put your folder inside a temporary extra folder, i.e. create a new AVS folder (on your desktop perhaps).<br />
Inside that folder, create the a new folder with your name, inside that folder a new folder with the name of your compilation. Copy your .avs files there, and your images and such to (your temporary) /avs<br />
<br />
In PimpBot, select your temporary AVS folder and make it include subfolders.<br />
<br />
When you're done, test your installer, then remove the temporary folder<br />
<br />
If you've submitted it to winamp.com, there's been (or perhaps still are) some problems with the site, so it could take some weeks/months before it's up there..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well as far as the site being whatever.. I am used to things not turning out so I won't be surprised..<br />
<br />
I did get some cool brushes and make a cool banner ..though ... ya think?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice..<br />

<br />
A more general piece of advice. When you think you are done with anything, test it. Test it 3 or 4 times too. Easy to miss things the first time through...<br />
<br />
Give it to a moron to test too if possible. I use mattfury. :)</div></div><hr />

I got the same problem too.. (just make an experiment with new pimpbot) I tick the include subfolders checkbox and the avs files are extracted in the AVS main folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You could always write your own install script if pimpbot is currently broken... the work involved is trivial, at least if you have the capacity to read and learn...<br />
<br />
pimpbot is much easier though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
clicking 'include subfolders' is the only way to make pimpbot not check the directory before compilation. will see if it can be saved to make it more fool-proof (not that i call anyone a fool!).<br />
<br />
btw, no need for two pimpbot posts i guess.. please lock this one!</div></div><hr />
