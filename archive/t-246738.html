<div class="posttext">People treat you as stupid because you foreshorten words unnecessarily, substitute words with numbers, use crass and idiosyncratic terms and don't punctuate your sentences correctly.<br />
<br />
Communicating yourself effectively has nothing to do with being a &quot;compnerd&quot; and everything to do with getting your point accross effectively and succinctly as possible.<br />
<br />
For an answer to your questions please search the avs forums for<br />
<br />
&quot;Overlay&quot;<br />
&quot;Multiple monitors&quot;<br />
&quot;APE List&quot;<br />
<br />
thank you for your time, please don't scrape your knuckles on the carpet on your way out</div></div><hr />

in other words, stop trolling and use the fucking search feature (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php)<br />
<br />
if you dont find anything, or have open questions, you may think about asking questions here in _standard_ english<br />
this means:<br />
no &quot;c&quot; instead of &quot;see&quot;<br />
no &quot;2&quot; instead of &quot;to&quot;/&quot;too&quot;<br />
no &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot;<br />
although winamp.com is now owned by AOL, aolbonics (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=aolbonics) are still frowned upon, especially, but not only, by PAK-9 ;)<br />
if that's too hard for you, you should maybe skip less english lessons at school<br />
<br />
and please, take more than one minute to write a post<br />
posting in a forum is not a race against the clock</div></div><hr />

We may come across as harsh but our point is almost valid to the point of truth. You can call it prejudice if you will but in general people who bother to type full words with correct spellings will do the following:<br />
<br />
1.) Make redundant posts<br />
2.) Ask stupid questions<br />
3.) Not help themselves, but expect others to help them<br />
4.) Make posts which may have content, but are unreadable<br />
<br />
No, I dont mean, you are guilty of these things, just that on average someone who doesnt take the time to fully type their words and sentences will do the above things too.<br />
<br />
Remember a lot of the people who browse the forums are not native english speakers and they will have an extra hard time with your 'text slang'.<br />
<br />
