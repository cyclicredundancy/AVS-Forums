<div class="posttext">ahh, you beat me to it!  i was gonna post this, but forgot about it until just now...and boom...there it is ;)<br />
<br />
what i was thinking was something like this:<br />
for every pixel (or gridline) in the buffered image, take the difference in brightness between it and the eight tangent pixels, then shift the image at hand 0utward by that amount (without moving  backwards) - essentially &quot;pouring&quot; the image at hand over a heightmap of the buffered image.  now, i realize that would be both a pain in the ass and REALLY fucking slow, but it'd still be a nice thing to have...especially with dynamic gridsizes and warpage control<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; LMFAO, &quot;0utwar&quot; got censored out of 0utward.  as much as i detest 0utwar, that's pretty fucking lame :rolleyes: &lt;/edit&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it's a game where members try to make &quot;armies&quot; by getting people to visit their userpages.  messages like &quot;hottest girl ever?&quot; and &quot;please help me with my computer!&quot; have been cropping up all over the place since it's inception.  it's ANNOYING AS HELL.  the reason 0utwar got censored is so people wouldn't get tricked into clicking links that said http://www.******.com/user.php?... or whatever.  i can't say i blame the mods though, personally i'd permban anyone who made those kinds of posts, but i don't run the boards...<br />
<br />
anyway, back on topic.  does that sound like a good idea to anyone :cough:unconed:cough:?</div></div><hr />
