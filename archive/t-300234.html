<div class="posttext">Was there ever a J10 pack? I remember doing a couple of remixes for it, but never saw it published :confused:<br />
<br />
Anyone know what happened to it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no, but i guess jheriko has his standard i-was-offline-and-busy-with-real-life-but-it-will-be-out-soon-ish excuse ready in his clipboard. multiply the eta by 2 and it will become true (or not) :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That response is pretty weak considering the fact that it has been 3 years since i made the remixes :p<br />
<br />
My files say 20th of January 2005 @ 13:15:37 is the creation date, which probably is just the date I re-copied them to my new harddrive :igor: So the actual date is even longer.<br />
<br />
Weird, the modifying date is 30th of march 2004 @ 21:28:36 :igor:</div></div><hr />

Dun dun daaaaa!<br />
<br />
I have everything bar the intro, which may or may not exist I forget. J is just totally disinterested in AVS now (like most of us) so I wouldnt expect a release to happen. I would post it myself but I dont really want to do it without his permission. Maybe I'll ask him about it and see if he's happy for it to go up here in its unfinished form.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">@tugg: the purple haze looks pretty much like some of Aderasi's Milkdrop presets.<br />
<br />
admittedly the 3D stuff kicks ass, but i still can't befriend with AVS<br />

sublimal Milkdrop propaganda ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i'd say it's pretty outdated and not his best pack. having seen what jheriko is capable of, j10 (as i've seen it) could &quot;damage&quot; his reputation. that leaves the options of a remake (or why not leave out j10 and do j11), which is more unlikely. some of the remixes were good, set them free!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I suppose I owe the community this one... its going to have to go out with out an intro... <br />

Sorry, it was a bit lame to hang on to it and not release it for all of that time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">one small problem. the pack was on an old hard disk and i have a small hardware barrier to overcome. if any of you, i.e. pak-9 ;) have a recent copy of it can you send plz? if not this will have to wait till payday...<br />
<br />
sorry guys. i am totally lame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PAK has kindly sent me an old version of the pack (sadly missing most of the presets, including quite a few remixes). What I am going to do is wait for month end, recover my hdd and then release the pack one way or the other. Either the older version with the missing stuffs if my hdd is forked, or the newer version with all the extras if I can get it sorted.<br />
<br />
What can I say? I became horribly unreliable after the first 9 packs. :(</div></div><hr />

Actually you were unreliable in quitting. You must be the person, who quit on a daily basis and still be the most active on DA.:igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
abort, well... aborts<br />
<br />
retry brings up same message<br />
<br />
ignore just brings up the message with the next preset name until all presets have failed to install<br />
<br />
Is there a way I can download the files and place them into a J10 avs folder on my own?<br />
<br />
(let me guess, I wouldn't be having this problem if I tried it in XP?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the installer was made with pimpbot 3.2 (or higher), it should work on vista. i will look into this once i get home. <br />
<br />
in the meantime there's a workaround you can try (it works with all pimpbot installers): run the installer from commandline (or try runwithparameters (http://rwparam.whyeye.org)) with the /unzip parameter (e.g. &quot;J10.exe /unzip&quot;) and it will just extract the contained files to the current directory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">all you vista pros out there, you should know by now that in many cases you need elevated rights to perform certain actions. a right-click on the installer allows you to run the installer with admin-rights, that way there won't be any errors!<br />
<br />
i will force elevating user rights to admin in future versions of pimpbot installers!</div></div><hr />

Someone please slap me in the face with a rotting trout.  Why the hell didn't I remember that?<br />
<br />
I really should know better.<br />
<br />
Either way, thanks, that's all it took for a successful install.</div></div><hr />

i was pretty sure pimpbot already elevated the user to admin, but now i was able to fix this :)</div></div><hr />
