      Was there ever a J10 pack? I remember doing a couple of remixes for it, but never saw it published :confused:<br />
      <br />
      Anyone know what happened to it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">That response is pretty weak considering the fact that it has been 3 years since i made the remixes :p<br />
      <br />
      My files say 20th of January 2005 @ 13:15:37 is the creation date, which probably is just the date I re-copied them to my new harddrive :igor: So the actual date is even longer.<br />
      <br />
      Weird, the modifying date is 30th of march 2004 @ 21:28:36 :igor:</p>

      I have everything bar the intro, which may or may not exist I forget. J is just totally disinterested in AVS now (like most of us) so I wouldnt expect a release to happen. I would post it myself but I dont really want to do it without his permission. Maybe I'll ask him about it and see if he's happy for it to go up here in its unfinished form.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'd say it's pretty outdated and not his best pack. having seen what jheriko is capable of, j10 (as i've seen it) could "damage" his reputation. that leaves the options of a remake (or why not leave out j10 and do j11), which is more unlikely. some of the remixes were good, set them free!</p>

      <p class="post-content">PAK has kindly sent me an old version of the pack (sadly missing most of the presets, including quite a few remixes). What I am going to do is wait for month end, recover my hdd and then release the pack one way or the other. Either the older version with the missing stuffs if my hdd is forked, or the newer version with all the extras if I can get it sorted.<br />

      </blockquote>if the installer was made with pimpbot 3.2 (or higher), it should work on vista. i will look into this once i get home.<br />
      <br />
      in the meantime there's a workaround you can try (it works with all pimpbot installers): run the installer from commandline (or try <a href="http://rwparam.whyeye.org" target="_blank">runwithparameters</a>) with the /unzip parameter (e.g. "J10.exe /unzip") and it will just extract the contained files to the current directory.

      <p class="post-content">all you vista pros out there, you should know by now that in many cases you need elevated rights to perform certain actions. a right-click on the installer allows you to run the installer with admin-rights, that way there won't be any errors!<br />
