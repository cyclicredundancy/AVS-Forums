<div class="posttext">:p Hello every1! :p <br />
<br />
I know this is a bit &quot;primitive&quot;, but what do you think of making a cube this way? :confused: <br />
(But admit that beat reaction is cool... :cool: ( :blah: :blah: :blah: ))</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Erm... <br />
<br />
I would like to check it out but, <br />
<br />
It says 'unknown method in Cube.avs'<br />
and 'No files to extract'<br />
(although it claims to contain 1 folder).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, if you coded that cube I have to say it looks very well done and you have obviously maths skills, but take out the rest of the water/blur/seizure crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:) Well thanx, man. I think that coding that cube was more about knowing some programing stuff, using that &quot;or&quot; checking all around ( :D )... IMHO this is actually the simplest way of making the cube. :rolleyes: I just felt that I have to make a cube using SuperScope, and I didn't want to give up! :p <br />
<br />
And btw., I added that water/blur/seizure crap only because I didn't want to upload just a plain boring cube, but I believe I would have came up with something more sofisticated if I just worked on it a little... :D For example, check this cute motion that I accidentally came up with:<br />
d=1/sin(3.14159265359*d)*asin(d) (Check &quot;Blend&quot; and &quot;Bilinear filtering&quot;.)<br />
It looks really cool with some water and blur added, but I'm pretty sure you'll come up with something better. :D There's an example in the zip file I just sent (Yeah, it's bulls**t... :blah: )</div></div><hr />

We don't use a lot of smileys here.. Plain English uses to work great too.<br />
<br />
Unless you are making a joke. Then 1 smiley will be sufficient.</div></div><hr />

Hah hah. &lt;- Is that ok?<br />
<br />
Sorry guys, but I just think that communication without faces is not communication. But I'll use less smileys if you ask.<br />
<br />
So, nobody's got to say anything useful related to the cube or the movement...? :rolleyes: (Just one smiley!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">still interested in feedback about your cube-code?<br />
I had some free hours so i could re-organize your code. Now a human brain is capable of understanding it... ;)<br />
(you wrote all the code in just a few lines, so i had to scroll a lot in order to read it. Also it's good to have the code ordered in some way, so it's easier to understand what does what).<br />
<br />
But now i know how it works and what you were thinking of while making this. Cubes and drawing ssc's point-to-point are nothing new, but your idea how to select the points is. Guess it took some time before it worked fine?! Anyway, good work, though it's not the fastest way! :up:<br />
<br />
I attached the preset with the 'easier-to-read' code. Hope you see that's it's really easier to read now:</div></div><hr />

Thanx man! You're helping a lot, I really have a bunch of stuff to learn!<br />
You're right, it really took me a lot of work to come up with the idea first, and then to make it work...<br />
<br />
My latest &quot;invention&quot; (I'm not sure has it been done yet, but it really should have, it's simple) is making a SuperScope turn around in the rhythm of the music. Check it out. (It's just a simple ring turning around.)<br />
I'd suggest that in &quot;Beat Detection&quot; you uncheck &quot;Auto-keep&quot; and &quot;Predict only if bpm was found&quot;, it doesn't work really well with those... And of course, the music should be with beat that avs easily detects, you know...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Erm, I just figured out that I made it to only give the impression of turning around, so here is the fix.<br />
(I know this trick has been used before 100%.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: Yeah, sorry, it's hard-to-figure code again... :D</div></div><hr />
