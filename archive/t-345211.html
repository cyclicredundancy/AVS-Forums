		My goodness its been to long since i fooled with AVS. Funny i look back at my old coding and still understand it to a degree. Funny how that how that works! hahahaha<br />
<br />
Anyway its not much but i think i got a decent result i liked using old old tricks i learned long ago i still remembered how to do way back when. I feel this needs something but i have no idea what. suggestions perhaps?<br />
<br />
Enjoy regardless.<br />
<br />
One thing I really liked is the effect the convulsion filter gives the preset. I did not expect that effect one bit!

		Welcome back!<br />
I like how the grid is executed but my main concern is that.. it's basically still a grid on a black background. It gets boring soon. Perhaps you could do something with the background? not too sure though.

		I thought of maybe a sort of effect like in some presets where at a set time the frame is saved moved then faded and the foreground is blended on top of it.
