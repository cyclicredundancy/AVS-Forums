      <p class="post-content">To mattfury:<br />
      shut the fuck up, you cannot make anything yourself, this was no help you have offered. he asked for syncing rotation, he will get the help for it cause we do know that is his problem.<br />
      <br />
      To varun-mark:<br />
      the solution is dead easy. so is the cause why it doesn't work.<br />
      <br />
      you assigned random values to "p" in each renders. what you don't know (i assume you don't because you made the mistake), is that every render generates its values independantly. so there are two values generated randomly. thats why there can be 1 and 2 and 1 and 1 and so on.<br />
      <br />
      solutions for the problem:<br />
      1. easiest is to use possibilities of the regXX features of avs. you store the rotation of one scope (or texer2) in regXX (this can be reg00-reg99 and is used in scopes, texer2s, DMs and movements), and then recall the value in other scopes.<br />
      <br />
      Don't change anything else, just type this into the first render's per frame section:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />t=t+.03;<br />p=(p-pp);<br />reg01=t;<br />reg02=p;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      and then in the other render into per frame:<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />t=reg01;<br />p=reg02;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      it should work like a charm. the other solution is to assign not random values, but music values to variables, because they have the same value in every effect. write this into both render's onbeat section:<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />pp=0.1*getspec(0.1,0.1,0)<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      hope this helped.

      <p class="post-content">Ditch the text and you've got a very nice component. Drop a load more stuff in there with it, and it'll rule. Maybe throw a sphere in the middle, like a rings of Saturn kinda thing maybe?<br />
