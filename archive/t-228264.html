      <p class="post-content"><strong>Fullscreen Issues</strong><br />
      Hey folks,<br />
      Been a Winamp user for quite a while now and even though I've tried other proggies (gasp!)..I always seem to go back to da 'Amp. Mostly for the (almost) never-ending amount of choices and stuff you can tweak the player with.<br />
      With this thought in mind, I have wondered time and again why in the world there isn't a option in the AVS viz for starting up in Full Screen mode? Yes, yes..the overlay mode isn't bad..but (at least on my system) when I choose fullscreen from the menu the colors are richer, more full..it just LOOKS better overall. I've also tried using the Auto-Video-Fullscreen plugin..as I've always tried to get the AVS as my screensaver..but I cannot get the &amp;&amp;%$ thing to go to fullscreen mode. (Yep the option is checked in the AVF-menu!!!)..when it overrides my normal screensaver it just stays in windowed format. Am I missing something here?<br />
      Stats: Windows XP, X86 Family 15 Model 3 Stepping 4 GenuineIntel~2666Mhz,Intel 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller, Winamp (latest build 5.1 Surround Edition)<br />
      Any info on this would be fantastic..thanks!<br />

      Ok..I tried the Auto Video Fullscreen plugin again..and this time just left everything alone. I CAN get the screensaver to convert to the AVS..it just has about a minutes worth of lagtime for the switchover. The AVS window opens up and then a bit later it flickers and goes into fullscreen mode...so cool.<br />
      Alright..guess I didn't need any extra help with this after all..lol!<br />
      Thanks Winamp..you freaking ROCK!!!<br />
