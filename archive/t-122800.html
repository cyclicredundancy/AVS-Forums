      Well since I can't be a fish,:D I'd like to see an option to record/save the visualizations with sound into either an .avi file or mpeg-1.<br />

      Sorry if this is a repeat.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Search the forums before making a post(didn't you see the red text?). This has already been addressed. There have been 2 APE's released that do this. Look at the FAQ on the main page and follow the link in it to the APE list. Look for the AVSGrabber APE.</p>

      Btw. Recording to an AVI is pretty easy, but attaching sound into it isn't as easily done as said, you'll prolly need some heavy pro video editing software.</p>
