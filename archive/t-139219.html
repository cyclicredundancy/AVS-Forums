		Nice &quot;mini&quot; pack :D (try to pack up your pictures a little better, will ya? Also remember that hardly anyone uses resolutions above 320x240 or 400x300 so you don't have to make them gigantic just because you want the quality to stay good in ultra high resolutions.<br />
<br />
Well as i said a nice minipack, strangely enough i liked &quot;Im the rainbow master&quot; very much, although it was quite filled with colors.<br />
<br />
Also &quot;Chrome Collid&quot; looked nice, but moved way too fast with 40fps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freeze brain&quot; is what i also thought was quite nice, but the flashing is killing it. Tho i don't know how to fix it without killing the effect.

		Allright i'll write a review:<br />
<b>Chrome colloid</b> - Nice glow effect, best of the pack:up:<br />
<b>Freezerbrain</b> - Nice, but i agree with tug here the flashing    does'nt look nice<br />
<b>I am the rainbow master</b> - Nice colors but too fast and chaotic.<br />
<b>Little blue boy (evil twin rmx)</b> - Weird preset, but then again looks nice..sometimes.<br />
<b>Little blue boy</b> - I like this one better than the rmx.<br />
<b>Raw power(rmx of grand light)</b> - Good preset, I really like the colors here.<br />
<b>Satin Galaxy</b> - cool colors, i like the engraved effect here, but i dont like too many mp's<br />
<b>Tentacles 2d</b> - seen this before, really nice effect.<br />
<br />
I would rate this 3.5/5, Nice work:up:
