      <p class="post-content"><strong>Member of the Month, September 2003</strong><br />
      Thanks in no small part to the efforts of numerous AVS creators backstage, I have decided to run the MOTM competition again. Members were nominated by the AVS creators backstage, resulting in the following candidates.<br />
      <br />
      Usuall rules apply - poll will be open for the next week, during which you can. At the end of the voting session, each candidate will get a custom title, the winner having his supplemented by (MOTM Sep '03)<br />
      <br />
      In case some of the names don't seem familiar to you, you can check them out, thanks to ethan_h for giving this idea..<br />
      <br />

      The point of this thread is, If you like to vote you can get your vote, If you don't like you don't give vote.<br />
      jack the king &amp; gaekwad2 please remain civilized.<br />
      killahbite your name is in the list why you?Do you have any complaint, your name is in honorable persons.<br />
      The thread has espesially point, that point is you are proud &amp; you can't accept any person especially me.<br />
      blazer1504 I can nominate 4 persons in honorable mentions, SORRY, your name is forgotten!!!<br />
      If you (blazer1504)don't like this thread why you read this?</p>

      shabaviz55 I like what you are trying to do but really I think from the response this is not needed. Personally I do not like to see a 'who is better than who' in this forum we really do not need it.<br />
