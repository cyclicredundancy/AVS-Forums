		Why would -anyone- use Python!?<br />
<br />
Anyway, there isn't really a simple way to embed AVS into a web page. (Yet.) Your best bet is probably to use AVSgrabber to capture AVS output into an AVI file, convert that into something that gets really good compression, and then you can put that movie file on the page instead of just the music... and kiss your bandwidth bye-bye!<br />
<br />
That's definitely not the way I'd do it. I program in Java, so naturally I'd want to try to port AVS to Java. That could be a fun little experiment! (Maybe I should actually try that some day, when I have infinite time and space.)

		Don't knock python. Its the only decent free thing that serves the purpose of a general purpose scripting language... although it does have some questionable design choices... its not that bad.<br />
<br />
And FYI Java is for noobs. C++ is where its at, its prolly the highest level langauge which makes sense in terms of what really happens in the background...<br />
<br />
Also AVSgrabber doesnt work with the latest winamp...

If you are asking that, you have no hope.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I wouldn't put too much faith in java, its very slow and weak as a general purpose language. I find it extremely unlikley it could handle emulating even a severly reduced avs. There are lots of problems like .apes and evallib which are especially non-trivial to solve.<br />
<br />
You need to calm down. Stop. Throroughly exhaust the internet of its resources. Come back here and ask questions.<br />
<br />
Its not realistic to expect someone to write a script for this in less than several month, its prettly unrealistic to expect someone to do it for you... since we have all wanted this for a while...<br />
<br />
Do some research and get real.

		Wow...What one day's absence (I think) can do...<br />
<br />
Well, I'd certainly give it a try, but I don't have the time or the willpower to sit and script something like that for more than two hours...But that's just me...<br />
<br />
I've seen some sort of bizzarro AVS-ports, but they all suck, and tend to run at about, what, 10 fps, tops.

		And if we were normal people we would have started as &quot;it's not possible&quot;. But it wouldn't have been so fun. :eek: Afterall, this one of the not so many superpowers we have. My othersuperpower is making beer disappear. It's like groovie, man. There is another dude here that can watch porn endlessly. And it's like wow! /normal people would dehidrate from that one/. Anyway good luck with that, but as someone above mentioned, just grab some of yer avs and post it on yer site.

Though i do share the beer disappearing superpower with Jay too, we should just battle to find out who is better :p
