<div class="posttext">I'm thinking of using AVS to run in the background on screens at a public concert/production and I was wondering what the legal stance is for this matter - especially for the ones supplied with winamp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">tja, that has been the big question before and everybody has a different opinion on this (unfortunately many don't clear that in an EULA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EULA)). some presets on visbot.net (http://visbot.net) have been released under a creative commons (http://creativecommons.org/) license, which deals with that issue.<br />
<br />
i guess a fair deal is always to put the name of an artist/group on the flyer/poster, if it's a commercial event.<br />
<br />
other than that i can only speak for myself: feel free to play whatever you like, that's what i made it for!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think its easiest just to ask the people whose presets you are going to use. A few emails and you'll have expressed written consent, and nothing will come back and bite you in the proverbial.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well as far as my opinion goes, i can understand if people view my presets in a non-commercial public event.<br />
<br />
But as soon as someone gets even a dime out of it, id rather not have my presets be used that way.<br />
<br />
I make them on my free time and don't charge anything from viewing them, neither should you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I suppose its upto whoever made the preset, however there is a lot of people out there who don't like their presets being shown.<br />
as for me i don't care, but no ones going to show my presets anyway, no one even knows about them</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I read the winamp licence agreement and there is nothing that says it is not legal. But I agree - If I was using presets not supplied with winamp, then I would speak to the person who created them. <br />
Also, The event I'm planning is a non-profit event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The presets supplied within winamp are still made by people who have nothing to do with winamp or nullsoft, they were just included because someone in the staff thought they were cool examples to show off what AVS can do.<br />
<br />
Most of those presets existed way before they were included in winamp.</div></div><hr />
