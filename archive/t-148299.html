      Hi.<br />
      <br />
      I understand that to perform the sort of visualizations that occur on screen (getting it from scratch onto screen) there must be a fairly dramatic brain behind the engine especially if the AVS langauge is simple.<br />
      <br />
      Performing those nifty transforms were definately written by a math wiz so please how can I get involved and learn some long verbose equations that can be applied to this type of visualization.<br />
      I'm a 4rth yr math student and would like to try out my math skills with something practical.<br />

      <p class="post-content">4 years of math is useful, but some good computer science classes would help just as much, if not more.<br />
      <br />
      You can start out using basic math to make some easy effects.<br />
      For example, the DM:<br />
      <br />
      BEAT:<br />
      dr=rand(100)/1000;<br />
      PIXEL:<br />
      r=r+dr;<br />
      <br />
      will simply rotate every pixel at varying rates which change on beat. This uses simple polar stuff to do.<br />
      <br />
      The best way to figure something out is to just invision what you would like to do, and then figure out the equations to do it.</p>
