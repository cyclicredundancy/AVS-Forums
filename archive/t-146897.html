<div class="posttext">Yeah, it's true, i'm still alive, who had ever guessed that...<br />
check out www.winkingvampire.tk<br />
<br />
The new pack is placed under 'preset packs', download it there.<br />
<br />
And yeah, i know, it's kinda slow loading for analog dial-up connections because I mainly use .bmp images, because ever since my computercrash, Paint doesn't seem to understand anything else than .bmp... even re-installing windows didn't help me. <br />
<br />
But anyway, It's there. a renewed website, created with my improved HTML skills :rolleyes: (*cough*). Comments about the website are welcome and so are the comments on my new minipack.<br />
<br />
And oh yeah, dont forget to sign the guestbook!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That site's taking way too long to load - even on my college T1 lines.  Can you just upload the zip for your minipack?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The site won't load. Just upload the file.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Uploaded it here, for those with too many site probs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for uploading it for me. But there are still two presets missing, it's not your fault, it's mine. I will upload them tonight, I'm not behind my own PC right now. (it's 12:27 here right now)<br />
<br />
M2k: the zipfiles are not empty, i tried downloading them myself from here (at my work). Try saving them to disk instead of opening them from location, that helped for me</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Site indeed takes very long to load indeed, you should use another program than Paint to convert your current pictures to .gif or .jpg. Personally I like Adobe Photoshop 7.0, it has more possibilities than any other program, and the easy use of it really works for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Still don't work.  What program did you use to zip them?<br />
Nevermind.  Downloaded Winzip and it worked</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hooh! works fine here. awesome work on the scopes:eek: the intro is awesome!:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not too bad.  They run at good speeds, but I don't like some of them.  A bit too similar to other presets already made.  A couple are alright though and look pretty sweet at 800x600 with over 20FPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They look pretty damn good and that intro is pretty sweet as people have said but the rest of the pack reminds me too much of newpicks, but with a little more polish on them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i converted the images now and here is the installer WITH 003a+b (yeah i know, 003 sucks. The only reason I kept it in because everybody would ask me for it after noticing that there were only the remixes A&amp;B if I kept it out, so in advance...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Intro looks cool, but i like the rest of the pack as well! It's good to see some basic avs every now and then, but with a more experienced touch :up:<br />
<br />
Some of them really look yummy ;)</div></div><hr />
