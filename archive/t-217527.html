      Hi guys,<br />
      I made a few presets and would be really interested in your feedback on them, even if it is negative. I put them up on deviantart, <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/download/18659211/" target="_blank">Here is a link</a> for directly downloading the .exe file [for the lazy]. The page itsself is <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/18659211/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
      I am trying to train myself to code better, so I hope this is just a first step.<br />
      EDIT: I can put it up in a .zip package if needed.</p>

      <br />
      You have a good color sense, imo. However, a lot of the presets are redundant, with only mild changes. For example, the lissascope is nice, but there shouldn't be six different presets dedicated to a sine wave. ;)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I liked 'Black Sun' (except for the mirror), 'Candy Fields (weak)' for the colors, and 'Light Matrice'. 'Space Beatle' has nice colors, but keep in mind that XOR blending almost always results in something ugly and should be feared. It's also just a little bit too "rapidly changing" for my taste.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, it's, again, not too bad. The good out weighs the bad, so I would say keep it up! :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are some nice visuals in here, but the response is sub-optimal. Focus more on using bands of the spectrum rather than just onbeat and v.</p>

      </blockquote>Thank you for the comment. I was kind of over-enthusiastic about that lissajous theme, it's cleared up now [e.g., down to two presets :p ]. I also removed some other presets in the version linked here, I need to work a bit more on some till they work like I want them to [funny that I pulled 3 out of the four you mentioned]. There are two new ones.<br />

      @ Unconed: thank you for your reply. I only recently discovered the getosc/getspec commands, so it's used only in my most recent one. I was going to ask a question, but found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1337596#post1337596" target="_blank">this</a> , so thanks for the quick answer. :)
