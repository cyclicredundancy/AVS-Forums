<div class="posttext">Why oh WHY does Winamp sometimes (what i mean is only the times when you havent saved recently and are working on a BIG preset) suddenly....CRASH??<br />
<br />
Im running Win XP Prof. and a eror report comes up and sez summing about &quot;avs.dll&quot;.And i have only noticed this in winamp 5.x <br />
<br />
Is there something i can do to fix it?<br />
<br />
Lemme know,<br />

<div class="posttext">Or switch to a different OS.<br />
Many people have complained how AVS keeps crashing over and over on XP. I myself still use win98 and it doesn't crash that often with me (not that it's fool proof either, it does crash, but not that often).<br />
<br />
But just do what hboy said, and save, save, SAVE often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Didn't you know: there's a conspiracy of the well known avs-artists going on. They bribed the winamp/avs developers, so that AVS nowadays always crashs when you try to make cool presets (i don't have to mention, that those who started the plot have special crash-free avs versions). This way everyone showing potentials is mentally kept down...<br />
Shame on you all!<br />
<br />
Joking apart. PAK-9 recently gave me the tip to store the preset you're making as a whole in an effect list. As long as you type code etc. this list should be disabled.<br />
Since i do it this way my crahs-rate has decreased a lot.</div></div><hr />

I do use an effect list for all my presets....it still crashes often.:(Are you sure you're disabling the effect list when you are fiddling with the code and changing it... because AVS only really crashes (in my experience) during re-compiles. Also on song change is a common one, so you can stop the music while your editing. With a really complicated preset I usually paste my code into notepad, so if avs crashes it doesnt matter much.</div></div><hr />

What with the new version of Winamp....<br />
my cpp(crashes per preset) has gone down DRAMASTICALLY.I get maybe 1 a day..if im lucky!Otherwise its like only once in a week!!<br />
yeah, go winamp 5.6:up: <br />

<div class="posttext">After a week of installing and uninstalling winamp xp and or drivers I decided to click start, go to my computer, right click, go to properties and click.  This should bring up system properties, go to advanced, right click on error reporting,check disable error reporting.  I'm sure there are various configurations suh as disabling only for programs etc, haven't tried it yet though.  Wouldn't you know it's not always the program that's at fault but billy gates sure has sum'n to do with it prabably.  So it's not a big avs conspiracy.  I to thought it might be bad avs presets since I had just installed over 1000 presets into winamp.  Guess I'll have to write good old billy next.  Usually winamp would crash within a couple hours saying some kind of vis-avs.dll error,  But I just got done running it overnight with no failure.  Yea, back to the good old days of just letting it run forever.  I hope this helps all you avs fans out there, and nothing kicks the llamas ass like winamp.  There is no equal!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this option is disabled on my PC since the beginning, but avs still crashes. Good luck for you, that it now runs crash-free or crash-reduced on your PC, but i wouldn't say that it is the windows error reporting that makes avs crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">natesuniverse</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th January 2005, 07:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you were right it was't just error reporting, it did make it crash more often though.  processor was overheating a little, 54C.  Never flubbed up in 98SE at that temp though.<br />
Cleaned everything out at 42C now. Even have system cache enabled that everyone says they have problems with using ati drivers. amd2600@3000+, 9800 tachyon/radeon, 1gb corsair. I give it a week before it acts up, it's windows????  Hope You figure your problen out. good luck.<br />
<br />
disable hardware acceleration???<br />
I also ran defrag may have helped.  files were really out of order for xp.<br />
completely uninstall/install  graphics drivers/winamp<br />
agp aperture in bios<br />
memory test<br />
direct x</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks for the ideas, but i won't try to get avs crash-free! It's just not possible when using windows.<br />
Perhaps i could achieve that it only crashes now and then, but then i will certainly forget to save often. And i promise: avs will crash when you haven't saved my recent work which contains complicated and extensive code...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Interesting ideas but as ^..^ points out your never going to get AVS crash-free its just a buggy app. Changing your graphics card drivers and AGP apature wont help because AVS isnt hardware accelerated, it doesnt used DX either so that isnt the problem. Memory errors would affect the entire operation of your computer (albiet rather unpredictably) and CPU overheats would cause your system to shutdown... well... you have an AMD so it would probably just melt into your motherboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">natesuniverse</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th January 2005, 03:18</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">never crash free????? I've been running avs 24/7 since I installed it the first time usually the only crash I get is if the window minimizes itself, or if it's something other than avs.  I've been running 2600amd 333fsb at 3000+/400fsb for last two years and no major malfunctions.  Even with my amd k6 III+ @550mhz I could get it to run respectably.  The only time I turn it off is I get a headache from to many strobes or I need the processor. The only time I've ever had trouble is w/ XP.<br />
As long as presets are written right it should not crash unless your pushing it to far.  To high resolution??  Spyware.  Are you converting mpg movies while you have avs on.  If you run out of resources anything will crash.  Know your limits.  Plus most all of the bugs I mentioned are are documented by ati or microsoft, they are system bugs not program relevant.</div></div><hr />

If you run out of resources anything will crash.  Know your limits.*cough* yea excuse me mate but I dont think AVS is using up my gig of ram and 3 gig page file, so resources arent a problem. I do 'know my limits' but the limits of my meaty 3 and a half gig PC are slightly more than running AVS and listening to music simulaneously.<br />
<br />
Unlike you I actually make AVS presets, and what causes AVS to crash is the process of compiling my reams of code as I am typing/debugging it. Just watching one preset you could run AVS forever but its not a very thourough test now is it?<br />
<br />
Even if a preset is written completely wrong it still shouldnt crash AVS, it is the duty of the compiler to trap errors and for AVS have a safe state in the event that code cannot be compiled. Exceptions are probably caught internally, if not they should be, so most likely the crashes are caused by a pointer flying off somewhere and writing over something it shouldnt causing windows to halt the program for safetly. Thats just my educated guess, but if I do say so its a lot more educated than attributing crashes to spyware or my resolution being too high.</div></div><hr />

Even if you devide by zero avs will just sit there and whatever ssc/dm/texer just won't work. I know of many fractal and graphing progrmas that when you enter code that produces infinity or circular functions, just crashes giving you a &quot;illegal operaton&quot; message as it dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes the compiler does trap the majority of  computational errors. If you want to see how AVS deals with a certain problem use the registers.<br />
<br />
reg00=1/0;      // divide by zero<br />
reg01=sqrt(-1); // imaginary numbers<br />
<br />
Bring up the debug window and see what it shows. But of course the compiler obviously isnt perfect or it wouldnt crash now would it ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">iÂ´ve got a tip.<br />
i did reinstall winamp @ 23.3.2005<br />
and did only add three important apes:<br />
eeltrans.ape<br />
triangle.ape<br />
global var manager<br />
since that i had no chrash.<br />
it seems that many apes can cause a crash under msxp.<br />
unconedÂ´s 3dtentacles give me an instant crash.</div></div><hr />
