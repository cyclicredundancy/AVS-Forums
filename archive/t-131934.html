		Well,in my opinion you aint a newbie anymore,you understood DMs and scopes as much as i can see.The presets still need more work until releasing,id write a big review but im quite tired and the vacation is NEAR! :) Personal favourite : no love ! -&gt; very sweet i really liked it .

		I would write a big review but I don't want to. There are some nice presets in this pack. You are using a lot of SSC's and DM's which is good. These are much less n00bish than the last pack. They are pretty much non n00b presets.

		I can see your skills advancing but again you're using that whole &quot;v&quot; random type thing that spews lines in your scopes, try to move away from that and into nice smooth scopes that look like things :up: I can see good improvements and there are some nice presets in there. Nice improvement keep it up.

		Noob has nothing to do with age. In a GD type atmosphere noob is acting stupid and treating the forum with disrespect. Here noob means that you do moving particle and water type presets. Stuff people have seen over and over again. Stuff everyone has made at some point. Atero and nic01 are 14, phaze is 15, i'm 16. Age doesn't come into it.

		Tuggummi made that avatar. Don't show anyone less or more respect because of their age. It's not how old you are. It's the presets.
