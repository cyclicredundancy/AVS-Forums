<div class="posttext">Can someone please tell me why this ssc-square has this ugly gap on the lower right edge? It's against all my knowledges of maths... :confused: <br />
<br />
This ssc renders 5 points:<br />
top-left<br />
top-right<br />
bottom-right<br />
bottom-left   and then again<br />
upper-left    (to make it a closed square when drawing lines)<br />
<br />
It seems as if the lower right point simply disappears when switching drawmode. You will see what i mean, if you add the lines:<br />
<br />
FRAME:<br />
t=t+1;<br />
drawmode=t%2;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The point doesnt 'dissapear' otherwise there wouldn't be a line drawn to and from it would there o_o<br />
<br />
As far as I know its an AVS bug, I can't remember if its a rounding error or not, but it probably is. Use your new coding skillz to make a pixel rounding fix.. I'd do it myself but I'm not in front of AVS</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">So after all its just a simple bug, a rounding error... What pleasant human behaviour. :)<br />
<br />
Besides: to 'what' does AVS has to round? (resolution?)<br />
And wich values are affected? (coordinates, pixels to be drawn?)<br />
<br />
Thanks for you explanations!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If I remember correctly, AVS rounds up to the nearest pixel, not sure though. I didn't look at your preset, but it could be a problem with render mode, replace versus maxium/additive etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th October 2004, 12:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">It seems as if the render mode doesn't have effect on this bug. Tried out nearly every combination but the gap was still there.<br />
<br />
If avs, as you said, rounds to match the nearest pixel, then shouldn't there be a specific resolution or screensize in which the rounding error doesn't occur?<br />
But to find that one out, surely is a thankless and time-wasting task for a dreary day. No task for me, hence. ;)</div></div><hr />
