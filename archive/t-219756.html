<div class="posttext">I just have to keep myself informed of my lack of advancement every once in a while. I realize I need to get back to coding and really LEARN something. The effects I use can be cool, but there's only so far you can go. <br />
<br />
What I would REALLY like, is if someone could remix The New Neon. I like the concept, but the colors are either too muted (for my taste) or too saturated (for everyone else's taste).<br />

<div class="posttext">what lack of advancement are you talking about? Actually your presets have always been a bit better than the ones before when you posted new stuff, imho.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but i personally really don't like neon/plasma style-presets. So i won't be able to help you with that color-remixing.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless i've got a few tips for 'milkdrop in a pinch':<br />
In my opinion you could make the colors last a bit longer. They merge into each other too fast.<br />
And try to 'fatten' the lines of the scope (use somewaht around 'linesize=8' in the per-frame-box). That way the preset gains a few more shapes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you, ^..^  I'm glad I am advancing somewhat, i guess I just mean as far as my own knowledge goes. I know all I know about making presets right now without ever knowing a thing about coding and/or programming at all. I know I am not unique in that respect, but hey, I'm the only reference I have on that point. I feel I should really start understanding code a bit better. I'm afraid the tutorials I have read tend to be a bit beyond me, although the more presets I make, I understand a tiny bit more in the tutorials. It'll come. *Wills myself to be patient*:D<br />
<br />
Darn, ok I was close with the colors on the neon; I can always keep trying. (I still am wishing for someone to show me the way *hint to someone besides ^..^ hint*)<br />
<br />
I understand what you mean about milkdrop in a pinch, I will take your advice (and I thank you for it) and tighten it up a bit.</div></div><hr />
