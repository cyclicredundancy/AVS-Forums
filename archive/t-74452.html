<div class="posttext">Under the AVS settings, and under Display, there is this Overlay Mode.  Now, I was wondering what this is!  I mean, it acts differently under different situations.<br />
<br />
I use the Wasabi skin.<br />
<br />
In my office, I use win95 and when I click on avs, I get no AVS to play.  However, when I switch the overlay on, the AVS starts playing basically within the Wasabi.  The effects can also be noticed on the background as well. I mean, I can see different colour shades on all the other software I use like excel, word or whatever.  The effects even shows on the start button and all mininmized softwares. The colour keeps changing based on the AVS.<br />
<br />
At home, I use Win98SE.  Now here too, with the same skin, AVS without the overlay mode does not do anything.  With the overlay mode switched on too, nothing happens.  But when I choose &quot;Set Desktop colour&quot;, the AVS can be seen and its not within the Wasabi, but on the desktop!  My desktop is there and where my original background was, the AVS is there now.<br />
<br />
Now, I really don't know what to make of this.  Which is supposed to be the right way its suppossed to function?  Could someone explain?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this was supposed to go under the skins section, but I really did not know if this relates to the Wasbi skin or not.  Please move it there if this does not belong here.<br />
<br />
Smiles :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
overlay mode with set desktop colour changed the colour of your desktop so AVS can use it like an overlay(like a backboard)<br />
<br />
AVS overlay mode will only play on that certain colour<br />
<br />
for more info post at the AVS forums<br />

<div class="posttext">Gee Thanks Winamprocker :)   You, know, I was kinda scared to put up that post thinking I'd get everyone flamed up!  And thanks for offering to get it moved to the right place.  Honest I did not know that there was aplace for AVS Discussion.  I just go throught the Winamp3 download page and get to the Winamp3 forums!<br />
<br />
So, now I guess my win95 ain't doing it right and I wonder why?  Under Win95, the overlay mode on with the set desktop option turned on or off, plays the AVS just within the Wasabi skin, thought the effects show on all software used except the desktop!<br />
<br />
Thanks again pal :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Technical explanation:<br />
<br />
When a program uses overlay mode to display something, it draws the target area in a simple color (e.g. bright purple). Then, using specific functions in the video-hardware, it changes that coloured area into something interesting (e.g. a movie). It's sorta like a green/blue-screen setup that's used often in movies for special effects.<br />
The advantage is that, when animating the movie, you don't have to redraw the entire screen, but rather just change the overlay-image that is being used. You can also take advantage of hardware scaling abilities.<br />
Now, suppose you have a window obscuring the overlay-area. Then, that area won't be in that color (bright purple), so it won't get filled with the video-overlay. However, if the color is badly (or intentionally) chosen so that the overlapping area also contains that colour, you'll get a movie playing inside that window.<br />
<br />
AVS uses overlay mode to get it to play as a desktop background. What happens is that your desktop gets set to a specific colour, which is then used for a full-screen overlay. Of course, if the colour is chosen well, any window obscuring your desktop will not contain that colour and won't have the overlay messing with its contents. If you choose the colour so that it's the standard windows-shade, every window will be flashing with AVS animations. It's a neat effect, but it makes working with your pc pretty much impossible.</div></div><hr />
