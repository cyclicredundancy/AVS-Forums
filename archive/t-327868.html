			<strong>Copyright use</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi Guys,<br />
           Can we use the winamp Visualizations as backing for our original music on Youtube as a partner user. Can't find any info in your terms that covers this specifically.<br />
<br />
Is there an online section that we can show to Youtube in writing as they require this.

		From the About box of AVS:<br />
<i>Advanced Visualization Studio:<br />
What we (at Nullsoft) use to (try to) get chicks at parties.<br />
<br />
Feel free to try to do the same (you are welcome to use AVS<br />
at parties, clubs, concerts, and whatnot. Just give credit<br />
where credit is due).</i><br />
<br />
In short, go ahead and in case you don't use your own preset(s), give clear credit to whoever made it(them).

actually he's got to contact each artist for permission, unless the license of a preset explicitely allows usage without further clearance

			<strong>Copyright Permission for AVS V2.82</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi Guys,<br />
           I'm sure most of us are aware of the copyright law but I'm specifically seeking a permission clause that I can forward to Youtube only for the AVS V2.82 visualizations that come with Winamp just for some occasional video backings with my own original music.<br />
You need to have a permission if you're a partner of Youtube to use this.<br />
<br />
Youtube require a written software use clause that can be referred to. So I need a Winamp page link where this can be found. For visualizations not just the general software use. (Giving credit is not acceptable and is not copyright permission.)<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about the thousands of possible homemade plugins that are available. <br />
<br />
Even if you make your own graphics you still need a written clause to say you have permission to have used that software/s to make or display each graphic as well. <br />
You need permission for each component of software you used in your making process. <br />
This is all in regards to commercial use I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
It's all become more complicated these days.

		Yathosho is right, I forgot not everybody allows it.<br />
<br />
Tip - dump 2.82 and switch back to 2.81d. 2.82 is buggy. You can download it <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?t=295512" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The AVS studio itself is free to use, as I stated earlier. There is no other documentation (that I know of).<br />
<br />
The individual presets (including those that were bundled with winamp)  may not be, unless stated otherwise.

		picman2 you are better off just using them and shutting the eff up. Youtube has to filter tons of uploads a hour and i'm certain they would not even give a royal whoopie doopie about you using<br />
1: a opensourced code<br />
2: a preset made on opensourced code<br />
3: there is the DMCA ( Digital Millenium Copyright Act ) if a artist that owns what you use and files this. they can then scream and moan about you stealing their stuff or not having permission and then youtube will take it down cause that kinda stuff can nail them more bad press they are not willing to want right now.<br />
<br />
Currently with the recent pulling of Sony and Panasonic from the United States youtube has been pressured to remove &quot;ALL&quot; content showing &quot;anything&quot; with something made by sony or even made with software by etc etc so yeah they are pretty much to busy to worry about one small person like yourself compared to a world wide public and mega corporations blah blah blahdiddy blah!<br />
<br />
soooooo just do as what that lovely excerpt from the Winamp license and just give credit with links to the software...also wow the original presets that are bundled with avs..mein gott man the artists in there you would be lucky to get a notification from seeing as i don't even know if EL-vis or heck Skupers are even reachable! let alone Degenic or NemoOrange so that pretty much says just acknowledge them with names and names of presets you used in what release of what etc etc get as detailed as you need as it said give credit where credit is due.<br />
<br />
good luck.

		The request is about AVS itself, not the individual artists.<br />
Bypassing the issue like that shouldn't need to be the way. There has to be a license.<br />
As long as there isn't one, it doesn't matter that the source is available, officially there's nothing that states it to be open source, or and free to use - apart from just the vague description in the about box.
