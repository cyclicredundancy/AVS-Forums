      <p class="post-content">Yes, that's right, ignore people who offer constructive criticism. That's what every hip new newbie is doing. Don't listen to them, they're idiots.<br />
      <br />
      Admittedly, that wasn't that constructive, but...</p>

      <p class="post-content">..but my comments usually are.<br />
      <br />
      You're not being interesting, particularly bright, or innovative. Being (borderline) rude to everyone who tries to help you is not a particularly bright idea. For someone seemingly relying on the goodwill of others to learn something, your comments are not appropriate to say the least. You have an attitude problem. The fact that I'm posting here is a sign that I care. I'm probably the most polite and amiable of the "old guard" here. Heck, less than a year ago, you'd be bitched at by 10 different people here for posts like that. Learn some manners kid.</p>
