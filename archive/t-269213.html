      One night on IRC skryingbreath asked if I would create a tesseract for him in AVS. I told him that it had already been done four or five years ago. After some searching I found the preset in a pack by Atero (now known as dirkdeftly): The Forward Flow 1.0.<br />
      <br />
      Essentially this is a remix. However, with the exception of a few lines of code, it's an entirely new preset. I must have played around with the preset when I first downloaded the pack because I had it saved with only the superscope and a few effects. The pack is no longer on deviantART's servers (and I couldn't find it on Winamp) and as such I can't post the original comment. I hope he doesn't mind too much. :)</p>

      It's still there.<br />
      <br />
      As for the preset.. well, it works but the difficulty with this kind of presets is how to make it look attractive.</p>
