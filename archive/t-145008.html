<div class="posttext">In lone's distorted world the &quot;whatever-it-is&quot; below the comment appears as a &quot;Unknown render object&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is this, and how could i make it work?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It is because of an .ape file you don't have.  Ishan Rocky made the complete .ape list, although I cann't find it on Winamp 2 or 3's site for some reason, so just talk to him about it.<br />
<br />
Just put them all in your avs folder and you'll be fine :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, it is most obviously an APE, but before bugging Lone, I would try downloading all his other AVS packs (make sure you have them install to the correct folder (AVS folder, not some temporary folder)  The APE should be directly in \AVS\, and Lone's presets would usually be in another folder under AVS.<br />
<br />
See if you can click on the unknown render    object in AVS Editor.  Usually it will say what the unknown object is called.  Then go from there.  Wow!  Lots of new members to AVS!<br />
<br />
I've been busy with AVS (for all you members who remember me), so I'll have some pretty good stuff cooking!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol... talk about stating the obvious! I have downloaded every APE in Ishan Rocky's list and accumulated every preset that lone has done ( that i know of). i was turning to the forums as a last resort, as when writing a pack (as i'm doing now) you want to get all the effects/renders avalible. it would be nice to have people not judge someone who asks a simple question as a newcomer to avs.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about?  Were not judging you!  You asked asked we answered.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, I don't know what's wrong now, just make sure everything is in the right place, that's all I can really tell you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:( sorry, I didn't mean it personally. :(<br />
<br />
It wasn't my intent to come across as judging you, and I generally try to be fairly friendly to newcomers.<br />
<br />
I must have forgotten my manners :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
HarsH:  Welcome!  There, that's much better.<br />
<br />
Actually, the question you asked wasn't exactly what I'd call a simple question.  It's just the opposite.  I was just wondering if it said on the unknown object what it was supposed to be (when you click on the unknown object, it sometimes says what it should be), which I thought might help people figure out where to get the APE.  It's just the question you asked I found rather tricky to answer :).  It is by NO means what I would consider a typical &quot;simple&quot; n00b sort of question.<br />
<br />
I was probably just upset because my laptop OS crashed and it's in the shop and they're recovering the files.  I'm sorry if I came across as unfriendly :(<br />
<br />
Welcome again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OOOOOHHHHH.  Actually when I said lots of new members, I wasn't referring to you, I was just commenting that it's exciting to have so many new people who have become interested in AVS since the last time I checked the forums (which was quite a while ago)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lord Nobady: please remove your copies of my APEs. I only allow third party distribution through AVS packs (out of necessity) but please don't 'collect' them for others to download.<br />
APE authors have no control over your collection, so you'll always be spreading outdated stuff.</div></div><hr />

Hey dude, cool idea but UnConeD is right. We're having a thread here which is continously updated with links to all ape's.<br />
<br />
Had a look on your site: The presets seem creative, but not very advanced yet and still pretty newbish.<br />
Just learn a bit more about coding and techniques to improve your skills. Just search (http://forums.winamp.com/search.php)  the Forums, a lot of explanations can all be found here.<br />
<br />
So: Welcome to the AVS-Forums! :D<br />
<br />
(And please work on your English ;))</div></div><hr />
