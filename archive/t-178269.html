      <p class="post-content">this thing is a bit buggy :)<br />
      if i push "downarrow" while going upwards, i die... this should be filtered ;)<br />
      also, the mouse control sucks... what about making clickable arrows on-screen? that'd be much better i think</p>

      </blockquote>guess it's a feature. at least the same happened in that classic tron game.<br />
      <br />
      and why don't you simply play with cursor-keys?<br />
      <br />
      however, i'm not entirely satisfied with the controls, maybe the whole field should be bigger.

      <p class="post-content">why i don't play with cursor keys? see above ;)<br />
      i'm used to the controls of Nibbles and most other snake games where you don't die when trying to reverse your direction.<br />
      <br />
      and why should there be a mouse control when it's not really usable... that'd be kind of pointless</p>

      </blockquote>Strange, it is filtered out. The only way you can possibly do this is by pressing down and up after eachother in the same frame. This is very difficult to do and I had a lot of trouble repeating it.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe I'll do another controlling method in a new version. Level support is the most important thing that must be added now.

      <p class="post-content">yeah and a bigger field...<br />
      and a key to begin the game :)<br />
      i have to click the message, then quickly move to the keyboard to control the worm... sometimes i'm fast enough but sometimes i'm not :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could also just make an outline around the playing field as opposed to drawing every block, it's kinda confusing with all the blocks.</p>
