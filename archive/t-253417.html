      <p class="post-content"><strong>uninstalling presets???</strong><br />
      have too many preset packs, &amp; need to get rid of some for space &amp; performance. But don't know how to get them off w/o an uninstall function. I'm new to this winamp thing &amp; went a little overboard installing the cool avs.<br />
      help me, please</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are no uninstallers, period.<br />

      The best way to organize your presets is by going to (by default):<br />
      <b>C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\AVS\</b><br />
      and remove the <b>(sub)folders</b> that you don't want anymore.<br />
      <br />
      Some .bmp files may remain, but finding out which ones are used where is nearly impossible because most artists still don't add their name to their images.<br />
      <br />
      Don't expect to gain a lot of storage space though, AVS presets are usually no larger than 10kb, generally about 5kb per preset</p>

      <p class="post-content">And you could just re-organize them by creating subfolders within subfolders that are within subfolders.<br />
      <br />
      But Wotl is right, you won't gain any notable space or performance by deleting old packs, but if you don't want them anymore because you don't like them that's a different story.</p>
