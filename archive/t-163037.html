		And here's the zip for people who don't have winrar.<br />
<br />
Jagganath - please use .zip next time - a lot of people can't extract rar's.

		well.  you have one nice color scheme, but only one.  and these presets only look like two different things, many are very similar.  go for more variety next time.

		I know you said not to be too harsh but I would rather not mislead you into thinking that these are good.  So please use this as constructive critisism(sp?). <br />
<br />
All of these presets are very,very similar.  They all use the exact same colour scheme.  I was unable to tell the difference between the first 5 presets.  They are all very n00bish (simple).<br />
<br />
It's decent for a first pack.  I would give it a 1 out of 5 overall.

		Yeah, Pixelcraft is right. Try messing with superscopes for a start. You can do some amazing things with them, and doing simple stuff is not that hard.

		I agree with the others, but I want to add a little thing : Try to optimize your presets. Though they are very simple, they are terribly SLOW !!<br />
Think to people who have a slow computer ... ;-)

		Hey Pir, <br />
Thx for your french tutorial !<br />
Now, I have no excuse to progress...<br />

It's a great idea !<br />
And your own presets are very good...<br />
