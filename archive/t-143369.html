			<strong>Jheriko - Warped Remix</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		This is two remixes of jheriko Preset &quot;Warped&quot; from his Hi-Res pack.<br />
<br />
The first remix is the one I prefer. <br />
For the first remix, turn off pixel doubling (it's too<br />
fast when pixel doubling is on, i will work on this though)<br />
<br />
 The second remix is a &quot;jheriko vs unconed&quot; remix with starfield code from Unconed's &quot;Intergalatic Octopus&quot;. The renderers in both are different from each other so check out both. I am studying all I can from Jheriko, studying hi-res pack feels like being an expert in parametrization.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what you think if you download this! This is my first upload, and im still new to AVS.<br />
Check out Jheriko's original &quot;Warped&quot; to see the difference

		Okay, but not too great.  The superscopes just stand out to much IMO.

		did you make sure you watched it without pixel doubling?<br />
when pixel doubling is on it looks too complicated and filled, when pixel doubling is off it looks more like a warp of sorts (and looks better).

		a) What's with the buffer saves? The first effect list is unnecessary btw.<br />
<br />
b) The stars need to be drawn additively or maximum blended.<br />
<br />
c) What's the point in having a 3D starfield if the rest doesn't match up?

		a)I actually was making sure i understood buffer saves properly so i just wanted to implement a buffer save. Delteing the uncessary buffer save made a 5 FPS frame difference, but i had it on my own file because  i just am keeping track of the things i am learning in the presets. this wasn't any kind of &quot;release&quot; preset but more of a hi please look at this and give me feedback thing.<br />
<br />
b) I dont understand why i would need them that way. I tried comparing your starfield on replace vs additive <br />
<br />
   Set Render mode -&gt;additive <br />
   Render your stars<br />
<br />
 vs <br />
   render mode-&gt;replace<br />
   render stars<br />
<br />
and they came out the same looking. <br />
<br />
question: am i right in thinking  additive rendering w/ trans fade gets a motion blur effect?<br />
<br />
c) I wanted to just have some working preset to look at with stars, in the meantime, im going to code my own star system and of course be asking you all about what you think, .. so i gues you can file this under a &quot;Yeah, i will get around to that&quot;.<br />
<br />
by the way, i am looking at this (remix 1, without the starfield)<br />
in 512x384 no pixel doubling full screen and this is how i wanted people to look at it... I don't know if there is a way to compensate for pixel doubling (since that might be the norm, if you look at Shreya's &quot;Bu_Hu_TT&quot; preset with pixel doubling it seems more correct than without pixel doubling turned on.

		b. Because they are lines, there are &quot;connecting lines&quot; between the stars.  Thus, occasionally, a black line will go across a star, making it look wierd.  Max / additive blend prevents this.
