      Hey, does anyone know of any packs designed by women because I got my girlfriend into AVS design and I think it would be pretty dope if she were the first woman to release a set.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Alright gentlemen; I present to you a preset designed by my girlfriend, Lady Anubuk.:) Expect to see and hear more from her soon when she releases her first pack. She is about halfway done with the pack now, so it might be a little bit before the 'official' release. Since we are having trouble getting her registered at the moment, she will be speaking though my account. And now without further ado, I present to you, the "Lady of AVS", Anubuk! :D<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">How do we really know that you are a girl?? I think "Solamon" is just trying to piss you off guys!!<br />
      <br />
      OK maybe not! When i watched this preset i had this feeling that i have seen it before. But that just me! But it looked nice. More colors would be nice i think (bright colors)...</p>

      <p class="post-content">HA HA HA HA HA!!! :D Don't you think we AVS dorks are cool enough to have girlfriends! :) I assure you she is really a girl. We were having trouble getting her registered before because of the way the board saves cookies on your computer and then instantly logs you in. We have corrected this problem since then though. Either way, we both hope you like it.</p>
