<div class="posttext">Hi Dudes,<br />
<br />
i got a problem with AVS 2.81b.<br />
Everytime a play CD-Audio the visualization ist OK but when i play a mp3 the AVS output is very poor. Only few reactions are visualized.<br />
<br />
What is the problem, i cant find the fault ?<br />
And this really sucks.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">This is the first time I hear such a complaint. <br />
<br />
Either you got shitty mp3's, or a shitty computer. There is as far as I know no difference between good mp3's and audio-cd's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And since most presets are made while listening to mp3's and therefor for mp3's it is very strange indeed that you say such thing... unless you confuse AVS with something else or have very special presets that are ment react to such high quality audio. :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think this must something have to do with the volume of the source. If i preamp the mp3 in the Equalizer the visulaization will be a little better but the sound gets scratchy.<br />

<div class="posttext">I think that Yathosho is aiming in the right direction. Probably the hardwear and the softwear of your PC can't bind together, or I am just f.....g wrong :S</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The most likely explanation is that your mp3's are badly normalised. When mp3's are encoded the encoder judges the base volume of the song and the maximum volume, so that in mp3 format the music will not cap (where the aplitude is too high and the waveform has to be capped at a maximum value) or be too quiet.<br />
<br />
Older encoders let you control the normalisation, modern ones tend to do it all for you. Badly encoded mp3's (mainly ones which are too quiet) tend to lead to poor visualisation because AVS can't correctly identify beats and oscilloscope/spectrum data is less varied because the waveform is flatter (quieter).<br />
<br />
In other words your MP3's are crap.<br />
<br />
If you have a huge collection of mp3's that you've downloaded then this probably isnt the case however, because most MP3's out there are ok.</div></div><hr />
