		Mr.Magick, I have done another remix of one of your presets.<br />
<br />
This time I conquered &quot;To the Heart of the Sun&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is how psychedelic colors blend, baby.  LOL.<br />
<br />
Mr.Magick, if you are having trouble getting your colors to blend, try the colorfade.  It is a favorite of mine.  If you are getting the effects you want, then, I must say, you really like wild presets. LOL.<br />
<br />
See how ya like this one.  Basically another one of my hologrammish presets you are used to seeing from me.

		Not bad.  ;) <br />
<br />
Kinda looks like rain is falling over the surface above and it is changing the viewpoint.<br />
<br />
Definitely a remix......because it does not look in any way like the original......LOL!  Take that as a compliment, LOL.<br />
<br />
Anyways, nice job :)<br />
<br />
Take care, I have class for a while today.....talk later!<br />

I'll see what I can come up with... <br />
And since we're on a remix kick, this is something I just started today. I thought it might be fun to start on the same base and see what we come up with.

		i can point out two mistakes with the preset,<br />
first of all, the dm<br />
&quot;v&quot; does not do anything in dm's, so you have to declare it,<br />
and the second mistake, well, you forgot to add the pic to the zip

		montana- sorry bout the pic, that tells me why no one liked my BrokenTV preset.... (damn)<br />
<br />
as for the V...  <br />
DM-<br />
Frame:v=b+.99<br />
Pixel: d=v-y<br />
<br />
I know that it has no use, but if you take these two factors the preset stops doing what I wanted...<br />
here's the pic... if you could, try the preset with the V, then take it out and save it, open it... you'll see what I mean...<br />
When the V is there it should look like a landscape with a skull floating above a litte spike/mound... when it's not there it just takes the pic and splits it on Y... unless you take out the V and set the DM to rectangular. Then you get the sigmoid effect... which also sucks because it flips the pic upside down part of the time.

		Montana- That is cool... did you see what I was trying to point out though? <br />
oh yeah... I've had this pic for awhile... I thought you might like to try and do something with it... Looking at it one way it looks like a face, turn it sideways and it says liar... since morphing stuff is the whole point in AVS, I think this pic could be super cool if used right.
