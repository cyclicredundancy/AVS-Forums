<div class="posttext">This belongs in the AVS presets sub-forum. Don't worry about it though. It's ok for a first preset. Very simple and made up of built-ins. Don't worry about that either we've all made presets like this. Try adding some colour and playing with the superscopes to see what does what. Read the FAQ and Atero's primer blah blah the usual stuff. Just experiment with things and you'll get better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well,noobish presets.Oh and as much as you hate trig you HAVE to use it in AVS cause if you do presets without coding you`ll enter the endless loop of seen-too-many-times presets.Have fun learning :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks phaze, just scare noobs off why dontya. I didn't know shit about trig before AVS. The best thing to do is red the FAQ and look through some of those threads in there. Figure out what does what basically.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">me too, I heard the name trig when I first entered AVS(!hyperbol). but really i didnt know even a bit of trig before i learnt about AVS, considering the fact that I was only 11 rs old...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've only been doing AVS for about 5 months. My maths teachers had tried teaching me trig but to no avail. This helped me learn.</div></div><hr />

:rolleyes: as if i would be scared that easily. anyone who knows anything about forums knows that theres a senior crowd always out to get any newbies that might tread on their territory. Also, just because your a newbie in a certain forum people think you have just discovered the internet.Its kinda sad but you almost get used to peoples ignorance:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th April 2003, 22:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Trust me. If anyone will scare any noobs away from the forums, it won't be phaze. *cough*atero*cough* :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I just meant because he implied that the basis behind ANY half decent preset was trig. And for the sole purpose of proving this wrong i just whipped this up in about 10 minutes that uses absoloutley no trig.<br />
<br />
I get bored a lot ;)<br />
<br />
edit: fixed attatchment</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This preset is simple and not very great looking. But everyone has made a preset like this before. You should read Atero's AVS Primer. I don't know trig at all.</div></div><hr />
