<div class="posttext">Allright,<br />
<br />
 I've been told it's possible in another thread, now I'd like to know if anyone can give me specifics on how..<br />
<br />
 I have an ATI Mach64 TVout PCI graphics card and a 3dprophet II MX AGP graphics card. I want to have them both in the computer (the ati for displaying my avs, and the 3dprophet II for obvious reasons). I don't want to run them simultaneously, just be able to switch from one to the other without physically swapping the cards themselves.<br />
<br />
 I've been told it's possible because I can select either PCI or AGP as the graphics card sommewhere. I need to know where (i.e. perhaps in the bios? something to do with the agp boot?) I can find the setup for such a project, and how to get it to work.<br />
<br />
 I'd greatly appreciate any help getting this to happen.<br />
<br />
 Incidentally, I just ul'd my first AVS presets Pack, Transformaplugs Version 1, Hopefully it'll get published, I personally think it's a good start, any feedback on em would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That would be great, <br />
<br />
 By the way, I was checking out your latest blurpack yesterday, some really great stuff.. I'm obviously nowhere near that level quite yet, but I've only been at it for about 2 weeks. I'm learning more about the superscopes and variables right now, I'm pretty sure that'll lead to some more interesting work..<br />
<br />
 You may not agree, but the screenshots really are nothing compared to the actual presets themselves... <br />
<br />
 I'm hooked ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well i've just about exhausted my knowledge on the subject.  If i were you I would go looking in the bios somewhere and see if you can change the primary display adapter.  If you can't find anything there, then go into windows and try to find something under your system settings.  There should be something there in one of those two places.  I'm on NT here at work so I can't snoop around for it.  Good luck, and let me know if it works out for you.</div></div><hr />
