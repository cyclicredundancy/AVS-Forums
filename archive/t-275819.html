      <p class="post-content"><strong>My first preset and a question</strong><br />
      I've been working on this preset for awhile now, and before I spend some more time on it I was wondering...<br />
      <br />
      Is there a way to access the BPM of a song that AVS calculates?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes. Click settings and then beat detection.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wasn't quite clear on this, but I meant is there a way to access it as a variable. At this point though I'm fairly certain the answer is no, so I just get to stick with the little BPM calculator I made.<br />
      <br />
      And if anyone cares heres a somewhat improved version of the last visualization.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's really cool. Good job on the BPM calculator. I've been trying to do one myself, but I was way to lazy to try and figure it out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I really think I should be able to do something better with the BPM calculator, but nothing's come to me. I'm not too surprised though since I switched majors that's the only programmingesque activity I've done in months.<br />
      <br />
      Also while I'm here, here's some much simpler presets I made to look like a heart monitor and a seismometer readout.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm.<br />
      your bpm calculator would actualy be a much easyer tool to work with then the bpm controller they give you for certain effects. could you see if you can make a preset that reacts to your bpm calculator as if it was being controlled the bpm tool.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not really sure what you're asking here. The BPM calculator I used for the superscopes doesn't really control much. As far as I remember the effects in AVS only react to a beat and not the BPM.</p>
