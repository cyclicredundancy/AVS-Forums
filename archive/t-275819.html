<div class="posttext">I've been working on this preset for awhile now, and before I spend some more time on it I was wondering...<br />
<br />
Is there a way to access the BPM of a song that AVS calculates?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes. Click settings and then beat detection.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wasn't quite clear on this, but I meant is there a way to access it as a variable.  At this point though I'm fairly certain the answer is no, so I just get to stick with the little BPM calculator I made.<br />
<br />
And if anyone cares heres a somewhat improved version of the last visualization.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's really cool. Good job on the BPM calculator. I've been trying to do one myself, but I was way to lazy to try and figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I really think I should be able to do something better with the BPM calculator, but nothing's come to me. I'm not too surprised though since I switched majors that's the only programmingesque activity I've done in months.<br />
<br />
Also while I'm here, here's some much simpler presets I made to look like a heart monitor and a seismometer readout.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm.<br />
your bpm calculator would actualy be a much easyer tool to work with then the bpm controller they give you for certain effects. could you see if you can make a preset that reacts to your bpm calculator as if it was being controlled the bpm tool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not really sure what you're asking here.  The BPM calculator I used for the superscopes doesn't really control much.  As far as I remember the effects in AVS only react to a beat and not the BPM.</div></div><hr />
