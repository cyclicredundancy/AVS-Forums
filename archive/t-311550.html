      <p class="post-content"><strong>cfg_fs_fps (Winamp.ini)</strong><br />
      as i couldn't found it on the web, i thought i'd share this little spreadsheet with you. it basically describes how the value for <i>cfg_fs_fps</i> is calculated.<br />
      <br />
      that value contains the avs settings of the following options:<br />
      <br />
      -Display framerate counter (fullscreen)<br />
      -Suppress status text in windows<br />
      -Suppress title text in windows<br />
      -Suppress status text in fullscreen<br />
      -Suppress status text in fullscreen<br />
      <br />
      simply add the values of each setting to get the value of <i>cfg_fs_fps</i>.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>cfg_speed</strong><br />
      while i'm at it, let me also explain the value for <i>cfg_speed</i>. it stores both settings for the rendering performance in windowed and fullscreen mode. the lower the value, the higher the performance.<br />
      <br />
      both performance sliders have 80 steps. for windowed performance, each step increases or decreases the value by 1 (1, 2, 3,..,80). for fullscreen performance, each step increases or decreases by the value of 256 (256, 512, 768, 1024,..,20480).<br />
      <br />
      with both at lowest performance, <i>cfg_speed</i> will be at 20560, at highest performance a 0.<br />
      <br />
      i don't know if why justin chose to store some values in seperate .ini entries and others combined in one. however, i'm obviously up to something and with no documentation available i decided to post this - without expecting that anyone ever needs this.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>cfg_fs_flip</strong><br />
      the next one is a mystery to me, maybe someone else gets behind it. <i>cfg_fs_flip</i> stores wait for retrace (windowed &amp; fullscreen), fast bpp conversion, and page flipping.<br />
      <br />
      edit: it's probably i bug, cause it all would make sense if the value for "all on" was 16 (instead of 14): page flipping (1), wfr fullscreen (2), wfr windows (4), fast bpp (8).<br />
      <br />
      edit2: still doesn't make much sense, maybe 14 is right and page flipping is -1?!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sounds like bitfields: 14 = 1110<br />
      <br />
      All on should be 15 (1111), it could be that page flipping is ignored if wait for raytrace is on... page flipping is a mysterious ancient hack that I can't really remember much about.<br />
      <br />
      Storing bitfields in ini files does seem a bit fruitless though. Bitfields are for binary data... sticking them into something human readable where every extra character ( all the [ = etc ) wastes as much space as 8 bitfields is a bit of a micro optimisation.</p>
