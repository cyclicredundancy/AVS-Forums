			<strong>What Do You Use....</strong><br />
		
		

		I was wondering, what type of program do you use to make your .exe files to send to WinAmp?  I have WinZip evaluation version, but it will display that stupid &quot;not for re-distribution&quot; screen, which won't look good, and prolly would be illegal since I can't distribute files with it until I pay for WinZip.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what they use, so I can get this pack published to WinAmp?

		NullSoft Installation System. Click on the Develop tab on the top of the screen and then select either PiMP or SuperPiMP. Those are the best programs to use in my opinion.

		Don't leave!<br />
 LOL<br />
<br />
Wait.....<br />
<br />
I have the .exe file, I used some program, LOL.<br />
<br />
The .exe file is packed, <br />
<br />
But now WinAmp is asking for a large and small image file.<br />
<br />
I tried uploading the large one, and Internet Explorer sits there forever, until the bar fills and says &quot;this page cannot be displayed...&quot; i suppose the file is too big.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer works okay if I dont put any files in, that's when they ask for the images.<br />
<br />
What are the appropriate sizes of the large and small image files?<br />
<br />
What do I do?<br />
<br />
Help is appreciated.

		Many people encounter problems with winamp's database, maby you should try later, that didn't work for me but i have another problem, the site does not recognize my image files. As far a i know there is no limit to the size of the file that you can upload, somme plugins have up to 4 megs.
