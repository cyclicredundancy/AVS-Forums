      <p class="post-content"><strong>Feeble Attempts</strong><br />
      Hi! I'm new here, but I know my way around AVSing relativly well. So, for my introduction, I bring you my first pack (well, it's more of a really really mini pack), entitled Feeble Attempts. I call it that cause it's my feeble attempt at making something cool. Anyway, I hope you guys like it. <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/3723153/" target="_blank">Go download it here</a><br />
      <br />
      Oh, and if anybody can tell me where I got the names of the presets from, then you get a cookie.</p>

      Born Yesterday is not my cup of tea at all... Speed me towards death is not bad, but you should try and do something about the noise in the middle due to excessive aliasing. Swagger is a neat idea, though I don't quite understand why you'd go through the trouble of distorting your scopes rather than just using a (dynamic) movement afterwards which gets rid of the aliasing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can't. Because DM'S interpolate based on a number of points (the grid size) otherwise it would be impossibly slow, aliasing is unavoidable. You can adjust the grid size, but it slows down incredibly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Then what do you suggest I do? I've tried most everything I can think of, which isn't much. I'm really new to this and I don't know much about it at all. The only preset out of that pack that wasn't created by accident was the plaid one, and that's just a bunch of lines.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Re: 'Speed Me Towards Death' antialiasing.</strong><br />
      Quick 'n' dirty solution:<br />
      <br />
      Create an effect list at the end of your preset. Ignore input, set output to 'subtractive blend 1'.<br />
      <br />
      In the effect list, create a render/superscope. Set it to draw as dots. In 'init', type in 'n = w / 2;'.<br />
      <br />
      In 'pixel', type in:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>x = i; y = 0;<br />red = 1 - i; green = 1 - i; blue = 1 - i;</code>
</pre><br />
      Now add a trans/movement to the effect list, after the superscope. Go to 'user defined', uncheck 'rect coords' (if it's checked), and set the movement to 'r = acos(-1) / 2;'.<br />
      <br />
      It should look like this:<br />
      <pre>
<code>[rest of preset]<br />Effect list<br />- Render / SuperScope<br />- Trans / Movement</code>
</pre><br />
      This will darken the centre of the preset, hiding the antialiasing.<br />
      <br />
      If you set the effect list's output blend to 'additive blend', it'll fade the centre of the preset instead.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure there's a better way , but this does the job.

      <p class="post-content">On second thoughts, multiply blend looks a lot nicer, but that requires a few changes, and I've exhausted my tutorial-making for the day. :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I've attatched it (hopefully).</p>

      Enable blend in the DM and add the line<br />
