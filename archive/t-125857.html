			<strong>which music for which kind of Presets?</strong><br />
		
		

		Difficult Question huh?<br />
<br />
Presets created to Techno Music wouldn't kick as with Metal i think. So i've linked 2 Channels that would match my Presets very well...<br />

<br />
How about your Presets, what Kind of Music do you use for creating Presets.

		I use mostly hard rock, but it doesn't seem to have a huge effect on my presets - I have many different kinds.

		Techno &amp; Trance is the way baby! Lots of hard loud beats and my presets will react the best way.<br />
<br />
Example try some PPK or Kylie Minogue's latest LP.

		Music doesnt have that much of an effect. Most presets i have seen work as good whith old rock(led zepelin, the doors, deep purple) and some really fast metal or even graind-core(brutal truth, extreme noise terror, sinister).<br />
For example I cant stand techno(dum,dum,dum music is boring) but love Tuggummies presets.

Yeah, i never meant that it wouldnt work, but you're creating a Preset according to the Sound's influence on YOU (not the Preset).<br />
<br />
At least i get my ideas mostly from Music, because it's just great if i create a Preset and it perfectly fits the Track i'm listening to.<br />
See if you hear ceertain Sounds, they give you impressions , no matter which kind they are of... like a internal Vis in your Head :D

		I use music with loud and clear beats and when the preset is made, I check for which type of music it suits best. while making relaxation presets, I ususlly listen to soft hindi songs

		For those that say &quot;music has little effect on presets&quot;... try listening to some Fantomas... that'll get yer presets in gear. ;)<br />
As for the music I listen to when creating presets... well I dunno, I just play music I like.  That involves mostly hard rock/metal and some techno for good measure.<br />
There's one radio station in my area that plays the most insane brainwave-altering music late at night... I've gotta start AVSing to some of that...:D

		Doesn't have an effect... hmmm... aren't you guys in the business of making music visualisers??? <br />
Besides if it can work differently with diverse moods you've got a good preset. <br />
By the way psytrance usually works well with all this stuff.

		I use hiphop and r&amp;b 80% and the rest goes out to some techno or house and a little rock like rammstein or limp bizkit or linkin park :) I tune with good beats and strong bass is great for testing presets(at least my kind of presets).
