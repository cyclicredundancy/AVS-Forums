      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D polar coords.</strong><br />
      Do they exist/what are they? I ask because I'm trying to make a preset with a point that bounces around in a sphere (I've already conquered the circle :D )</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are two ways to do 3d polars that I know of (in 3-space it is even more obvious that polars are just convenient parametrics).<br />
      <br />
      Spherical: you have d, theta, phi.<br />
      <br />
      Cylindrical: you have d1, d2, theta<br />
      <br />
      Cylindrical is easy to figure out, you basically add a height value to your 2d polars. This probably won't help you very much with your sphere problem.<br />
      <br />
      The spherical co-ords are a bit more complex, you have the distance and theta but phi is the angle between the ray passing through the point and the origin and the z axis, rather than the projected angle between them onto the xz or yz plane. You've probably already seen this co-ordinate system being used to define sphere parameterisations. The conversion formulae are:<br />
      <br />
      x=d*cos(theta)*sin(phi)<br />
      y=d*sin(theta)*sin(phi)<br />
      z=d*cos(phi)<br />
      <br />
      and<br />
      <br />
      d=sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)<br />
      theta=arctan(y/x)<br />
      phi=arctan(sqrt(x^2+y^2)/z)<br />
      <br />
      You can probably figure this out for yourself if you drew a diagram, just to check that my maths is right here.<br />
      <br />
      In this coordinate system it is also common to replace d with rho.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes it is. There's a reason this forum defaults to only displaying posts from the last five days.<br />
      <br />
      And if you don't already have a use for it, then why did you post in the first place?</p>

      rx, ry and rz ar the rotations around the x, y and z axis respectively and d, r1 and r2 are d, theta and phi described above.<br />
      <br />
      What you can see is two opposite 'spirals' around the surface of a sphere defined by radius=0.5 (d=0.5;).<br />
      <br />
      Hope that helps somehow.
