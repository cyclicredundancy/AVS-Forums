      <p class="post-content"><strong>Controlling AVS from external program</strong><br />
      Hi!<br />
      <br />
      I'm coder and a VJ, and i would like to do some testing with AVS. I noticed the Hotlist program here in forums, and i would like to try something similar but with different approuch. Problem is that i dont have a clue, how to control AVS from external program. I use Delphi for coding.<br />
      <br />
      I think it might be same kind of IPC_ codes, like Winamp has, but i havent found any details.<br />
      <br />
      Main thing that i'm looking for, is how i can load specific preset into AVS by using plain filename?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well my friend, i've done and tried what ever might be possible before and I can tell you, if you dont want to go into bad hacking, using weird and creepy methods to crawl trough avs's user interface to alter stuff, there's no fucking way unless you alter avs itself so it will accept external control messages.<br />
      <br />
      There is also the Playlister program out there, but this is even less customizeable than Hotlist.<br />
      <br />
      But if you're good in Delphi programming and interested, you could join me in Hotlist developement and improve it the way you like. If you're really into coding, this would be awesome<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise if you just badly want to know how to load presets, try the following:<br />
      <br />
      Open your explorer, select a preset, drag and drop it into avs.<br />
      See? It works.<br />
      Now check out what Messages are sent and what kind of controls are used when drag&amp;drop occurs.<br />
      Now try to fake this with your own application.<br />
      <br />
      Controlling a program that has not been designed for external control, is probably more work than you imagine.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, thanx Magic.X for the reply.<br />
      <br />
      Actually just right after i posted my question, i thinked about that drag'n'drop method, but i didnt tested it. It was just an idea in my head.. and it seemed to be right one. :)<br />
      <br />
      So i assume that Hotlist uses this d'n'd method for loading exact preset?<br />
      <br />
      I have been coding with Delphi since first Borland releases, so you might say that i'm into coding.. :) i do it as a hobby and it is also my job. I have been also doing DJ'ng over 15 years now, so I have couple ideas lying around.. I might do my version of 'Hotlist' and if it comes up something handy, we might join our forces and create the ULTIMATE AVS Preset Controller thingy.. :)<br />
      <br />
      Are you using Delphi for the Hotlist?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup, thats why you're qualified.<br />
      <br />
      A hint on how to easy things up:<br />
      <br />
      Don't use d'n'd, instead check the Hotkey function and the related aph files, Winamp uses. This is the better way to do for most purposes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you can get a third party help from the makers of avs you could do a lot out of it like controlling it externaly..wouldnt you?<br />
      That's the "bad hacking" part i guess.<br />
      <br />
      But i guess that we could obtain way more than preset switching if they helped out!<br />
      <br />
      Like gathering files and settings from presets and quick load them back as maccros.<br />
      Adding a prefab dynamic moovement that'll make a preset goes 3d in a quickie.....and mayby even make the code increase so that the 3d comes in a fade...<br />
      <br />
      Making some wicked changes to a preset while its playing using keyboard shortcuts...<br />
      <br />
      It could be possible to fade trough 2 instances of avs in fullscreen...<br />
      <br />
      .....By the way i'm a bit tired today been partying all night, but the main idea is here: got to get help from the avs makers..</p>
