<div class="posttext">yeah, i am getting better, check this out....I finally managed to synchronize dms and ssc's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There's no way this can be right because your scopes aren't aspect-ratio-correct.<br />
<br />
And your order of rotations is pretty wrong too for the tunnel (dm and scope both use x,y,z). You have set the orientations so that it looks like you're going up/down into an elevator rather than forward/backwards into a tunnel. This makes the rotations pretty redundant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">can someone please explain how to sync scopes and DM's please, ive tried all sorts of crap and can never get it to work. Ive searched the forums but to no avail. Help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I only know a couple of tips:<br />
<br />
1: Don't use random, use you own seadable random number generator, or music data<br />
<br />
2: You tell a scope where to go. you tell a DM where to get it's information from. You have to account for that somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, unconed taught me to do it by doing your rotations in SSC normally, then doing them in the reverse order for DM.  so if you rotate it around z, y, then x in your SSC, go for x, y, then z in the DM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">DAMN! I wanted to put a 3d SSC in my tunnel preset too :) Too many weird stuff here between you and me shreyas hehe. This unending trench is better and looks nice,but could be better :) Its great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh man..and I thought I was going in the right direction! :(<br />
anyway, I am still working on it and I will send the correct one some time later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd March 2003, 05:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">a tweaked and tampered version of the first. I hope the synchin is correct and thats what I made this for ( to learn dm and ssc synchin )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd March 2003, 18:21</div></div>

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 07:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Go with the first version.<br />
<br />
Pretty sweet (for a tunnel preset :igor: ) Though could use more variation in the movements. Can't really help you here :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 08:37</div></div>

<br />
<div class="posttext">Lately there has been lots of synced dm and ssc conversations and i thought to do some syncing too...<br />
<br />
 Well down there is what i came up...<br />
<br />
 Like you can see its just a tunnel (flatt one, i just didnt whant to make JUST round tunnel) with really simple surface and the cam moves inside the tunnel, and there is one spehere what is somewhat synced with the dm (i think there is something incorrect but i can figure out what)...<br />
<br />
 Now there is thing what i want to do with the preset:<br />
I want to make the sphere &quot;not moving&quot; (first appearing from the &quot;end&quot; of the tunnel and then come really close to the cam, and then to be reset at the &quot;end&quot; of the tunnel, well the not moving effect if you understand what i mean:))...<br />
<br />
 Could anybody help me with this one, thank you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">this seems to be the problem with me too. the ssc seems to rotate on the x axis (or y?).<br />
i havent looked into the code yet, but it seems that the problem is similar to mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th March 2003, 18:16</div></div>
