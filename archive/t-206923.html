      <p class="post-content"><strong>TexerII &amp; Colormap</strong><br />
      This is a request for unconed, two things I would like to see in your APE's:<br />
      <br />
      TexerII: The option to have a black and white mask for the image used, so that one can do replace blended effects<br />
      <br />
      Color Map: The ability to pick the color map number with registers, and maybe the map cycling too. This would be useful for mouse control presets where I would like to have the option of picking the color map in a user menu (I know it can be hacked around with coeable effect lists but its slower and uglier)<br />
      <br />
      They arent particularily complex requests, but things that I think would make the APEs more useful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i really love the trans texer for that ability texer2 doesn't have :) thats why sometimes i still use it if n is not above 1024. with it, you can also render adjustable blend and that results in really nice holographic effects sometimes :)<br />
      <br />
      and i just agree with the second. though i think i will never really use it, too much work now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">how about also accepting non-integers for the color maps?<br />
      (for a start)<br />
      if you want to invest further time in that, you could even allow the user to set an alpha value for each color map so that they can be blended together in whatever way you like</p>

      It wouldn't, I assume you mean bilinearily resizing the images for sizex and sizey. You'd get some blurring but it wouldnt really notice, I guess you could bucibicly resize them if you thought it would, but computationally its not really worth it.<br />
      <br />
      Tell me if I've completely got the wrong end of the stick here.

      <p class="post-content">I think maybe UCDs question is a lazy rhetorical attempt to get out of APE coding. ;)<br />
      <br />
      I can't see whats so hard about implementing both alpha and bilinear together. bilinear filter the rgb and bilinear filter the alpha then final=background*(1-alpha)+rgb*alpha<br />
      <br />
      Other problems? You get a blurry line instead of a clean one which could spoil an effect. Solution. Turn off bilinear.<br />
      <br />
      An alpha image would be useful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dont think filtering the rgb then the alpha is really necessary, you can just multiply them and filter the result.</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can't do that<br />
      <br />
      think about it. if you have a circle for instance that you want to replace blend only the circle and bilinear filter the whole jobby. you need to bilinear the alpha seperately for the final combine so that it blends the edges... otherwise you get ugly almost black edges on the circle where you blend rgb*alpha and use the original channel.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, I was thinking you could multiply the scene by the mask, add the rgb then do the filtering afterwards but that doesnt really make any sense now I think about it, cos the filtering is part of the initial resizing before the mask is even applied. Never mind.</p>
