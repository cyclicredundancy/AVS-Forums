      <p class="post-content">Yeah, pretty much what you said. n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      You kind of need to lay off yourself....calling yourself a n00b avs artist and an underacheiver isn't getting you anywhere too fast....if you tell yourself "This is gonna be the coolest preset I've ever made, and I'm gonna work hard on it!" Instead of saying "I just whipped this up a litle while ago, it's kinda stupid" you'll get better. Just my opinion.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's the old tale:<br />
      <br />
      Person comes.<br />
      Person stays for short period, not enough time for anyone to be familiarised with person.<br />
      Person decides to leave.<br />
      Person thinks it's big deal when person leaves.<br />
      Person changes mind within days.<br />
      Person thinks it's big deal when person returns.<br />
      <br />
      Welcome back and all but come on, you've been here barely a few weeks.</p>
