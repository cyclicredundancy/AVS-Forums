      Here's the thing. You know how the X in the video for D-X video?? Could someone make something similar to that? But nothing too similar. I know you can make it extremely complex. I was hoping that someone was up to such a task like this. I got their theme song playing right now anyways...And it would be a whole lot better if there was a preset made specifically for this theme song.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would gladly help you, except you forgot to include enough information for an effortless answer.<br />
      <br />
      X?<br />
      <br />
      D-X?<br />
      <br />
      video?<br />
      <br />
      Some links would be nice. I would search the web... but then I might be too tired to answer :p<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: also, this does not belong in the wish list. The wish list is for AVS <b>feature</b> requests. Not presets.</p>
