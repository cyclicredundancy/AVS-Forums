      Here's a preset I made for which I got the idea from the Inspiration thread.<br />
      <br />
      It's graphitti in the subway. It does tags as you walk a long, with wicked styles. Its quite minimal but then I made this Avs with this intentionaly in mind, Which I find harder than mixing different things together.<br />
      <br />
      yo check dis holmes.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Very empty walls. Increasing the number of superscopes helps, but then there isn't much variety. Instead, have the superscope(s) pick a random x and y variable on beat and move exponentially to that point(i.e. x=.95*x+.05*nx;). Also, add on beat color changes to more than just shades of red and purple. The effect is nice though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">doubling that helps. for example, rxc=(rand...)/100; ; txc=txc*0.9+rxc; xc=xc*0.9+txc;<br />
      <br />
      also, i've noticed that the size goes to zero at the x-axis - fix this :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is a bad one. It doesn't do anything. I mean it really just sits there. Plus it says gra-it(I think it's supposed to look like it says grafitti, but it doesn't look much like it).</p>

      <blockquote>
        somehow i get the feeling you've never seen real graffiti art...
      </blockquote>Shhhhhht .. I used to be in a crew called "VGA" Visuals Gone Abstract. We mostly did pieces (the mural types). In my younger more radical years .<br />
      <br />
      So it's not code fantastic I'll admit that, I have got some more ideas for different styles on the spray movment. I went through about 50 different types of type coding combinations of sin and tan movments, this is the one I eneded on cause I got lost in it and got tired (one nights work). It's ok but kinda repeats on the "e" shaped letter, I had k's, j's, g's, m's, t's, i's, n's and s's all in different SSC codes.<br />
      <br />
      I'm going to try and capture these shapes in code and then have it switch between them on beat or something. I was kind intending the subway wall to be kind flat because thats they best place to tag. and concrete walls well what else is there to say.<br />
      <br />
      I was wanting to make the left drift last a bit longer whist keeping the movment of the spray at the same speed, couldn't find out how yet.<br />
      To make the wall drift across futher mabey another third of the screen distance.<br />
      <br />
      I had the spray changing colours on beat but left that till after for shaded dot.<br />
      <br />
      After I get the SSC to swith between V, i, s, u, a, l, A, g, n, o, s, i, a, I'll use it in a pack. One thing I wouldn't mind doing is have like a some bmp's that run along the wall like small posters or something<br />
      <br />
      aww gee I thought it had quie a bit of impact. Yeh yeh needs more work as usual.<br />

      <p class="post-content">yeh theres just an "e" that comes up every now and then in the one I posted I was just saying when I was playing around with the SSC's I got all different styles of letters and I intend to rope them altogether somehow. Still a few letters I haven't yet made. Each letter (or two) is contained in a different superscope.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, sorry Visag. That might turn out well then. Try to combine it all into one superscope instead of splitting it up. This way you won't have to synchronize the scopes (I'm assuming you're going to try to spell Visual Agnosia or something). Plus it will be slightly faster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeh thats the idea I had in mind I'm studing how to switch to different SSC's on beat in the same SSC but in sucsession. I also got to get the scopes to form the letters. thats going to be fun...Also I have to simplify each scope to draw one letter only.<br />
      <br />
      If I get it going and get a whole alphabet together. I might comission someone to write an ape that'll take the current track name and spell it out. That'd be cool ...yeh like mabey next year.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers anubis I'll look at the changing ssc code you showed me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually it was about making a scope that morphs between the letters A, T, E, R, and O for the intro for my next pack.<br />
      <br />
      and an APE that displays the current song name has already been discussed, it's been determined that it's impossible, as Winamp doesn't allow APEs access to such information.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I already made a small preset that I was going to use as an intro to a pack I never release that smoothly changed between letters A, N, U, B, I, S with a nice 2003 SS floating around. Didn't really like the effect though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I still like the scope I did in Neomorphism, from my first pack, that changed extremely smoothly between six music-responsive 3-d objects :D I never went back to it to find out how to make them random, tho :/<br />

      <p class="post-content">Btw the 'wall' on the back looks very weird to me. I guess it's supposed to resemble a subway wall or something, but this doesn't float my boat...<br />
      <br />
      Some ideas:<br />
      - inversional relationship between the speed of the can and the thickness of the spraypoint<br />
      - use a dotscope with gaussian distribution around the center for an airbrush effect<br />
      - try to have it make actual graffiti motions rather than random sin/cos stuff (if it didn't have the name graffiti, I doubt I would've recognized it)<br />
      using some clever play with derivatives and digital differentiation (sum of derivative) you should be able to get some nice chaotic (in the mathematical sense) movements.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeh ok all points duly noted. I think it was just the concept which I posted, I'm sure it doesn't float many boats as far as complexity and frillyness are concerned, but it was different was it not?. A step above wacking standard trans and render together?. i have been working on it more and have refined it slightly and still working on movements for different letters, is 41 degrees celcius in Adelaide at the moment (in the shade) and the nights aren't much cooler "Heat wave", so "sticking" to my computer has taken a back burner.. I've been down the beach alot. We need more air cond.<br />
      <br />
      I guess I'll put more work into presets before I show them, I dunno I just get excited I guess.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Was playing around a bit with a spray-can like movement, and this came out.<br />
      <br />
      Sure it doesn't look like graffiti anymore, but it's still neat :). The scope's movement are defined using a differential equation, which is 'solved' with a quick hack.<br />
      <br />
      Great for chilling out. It is actually music responsive in its movements btw, just not intended to be a party-preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">For anyone thinking about clicking that link, DON'T. It pops up a window that is damn near impossible to close, running a looping audio clip saying "You are an idiot! Ha ha-ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!" in five part harmony. If you DO close it (which you have to do from the start menu), it pops up a new one that generates smaller windows that do the same thing. If you try to hit CTRL for CTRL+W or CTRL+ALT+DEL, it'll pop-up an error message saying "You are an idiot!" - you have to go to the desktop and then hit CTRL+ALT+DEL as fast as you can, then close one of the windows - usually this closes everything if you're using IE, but it's not guaranteed. The end result of all this is you will lose everything you were doing in your browser, or, if you can't close the browser, everything you were doing on your computer.<br />

      I lost a lot of fucking work on both a very, very hard preset, and quite a bit of my homework as well. Frankly I think another post like that deserves a temporary ban. The bottom line is, that link was effectively a virus, and you're the only one laughing. Don't EVER do it again :mad:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Use a decent browser that doesn't transfer control of your soul over to a website :). Pop-up killer is advised too.<br />
      <br />
      And save often! I'm so used to AVS crashing (happens a lot when you make complicated presets) I save every couple of minutes. I also save to different presets, so if I save a screwy copy, the preset isn't lost completely.<br />
      <br />
      Same for your homework really.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, people who make stuff like this should still be punished. A modern greek-style punishment: for eternity, he/she must sit behind a computer and close pop-up windows, except every window he closes opens up a new one :p.<br />
      <br />
      I can only imagine how much email traffic was wasted to stupid jokes like these.</p>

      Am I correct that when using pop-up-killers U cant use messenger (sad as it is).<br />
      My solution for this link was easy:<br />
      I closed all the popups from the task manager until there where like 30 of them and then windows(XP) displayed message : Error with IE(or something like this)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, except I was doing everything for the AVS in a java applet, and I lost a ton of research that I didn't copy to another file. Foolish me for not expecting my browser to be taken over by some childish prank. Oh, and I've tried pop-up killers, they always fuck my computer up royally.</p>

      </blockquote>I assume you mean MSN Messenger... I don't know, I use <a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/trillian/download.html" target="_blank">Trillian</a>. Much better, and I can use ICQ and MSN in the same app.<br />
      <br />
      As for the browser, I recommend <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>.<br />
      It's only at version 0.5 and already it beats IE hands down for me.<br />
      (It's yet another Gecko-derivative)<br />
      <br />
      Why complain about crappy MS software when there's better alternatives around?
