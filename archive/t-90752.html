			<strong>More AVS questions...</strong><br />
		
		

		Some more questions =Ã¾<br />
<br />
1. Is there a way to fully randomize all the dots' position at the 1st frame, and keep that position? (w/o random generator, if possible)<br />
<br />
2. Is there a way to make a filled triangle/square/pentagon/hexagon/octagon?<br />
<br />
3. Is it possible to make a capsule-shaped 2D SSC w/o point-by-point assigning? (The only way I know of is to extend the SSC at the middle using point assignment)<br />
<br />
4. 3D SSC prob : How do you make a sphere? ( :p )<br />
<br />
5. Is there any 3D DM base code? (What I mean is, 3D SSC base code for DM)<br />
<br />
I think that's all...<br />
<br />
Oh, and BTW, others who have non-n00b AVS questions, feel free to use this topic to ask your questions =)

		1. No, use a random gen.<br />
<br />
2. Uh? You do know how to do a solid superscope right? Just draw lots of lines to fill the area as needed. For polygons, you can either split it up as a quadstrip (strip of 4-sides polygons) or start at the outside and spiral towards the center.<br />
I started doing a dodecahedron preset a while ago (which freaked because of too many variables) and I used the following scheme:<br />
<br />

<br />
3. For a line superscope, just draw a circle and offset each half on an axis. AVS will draw the connecting lines. For a dot superscope you'll need to make a combined superscope that draws 2 half-circles and 2 lines. Use different code depending on the range of i.<br />
<br />
4. Look up <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html" target="_blank">spherical coordinates</a> and evaluate them for all allowed values (phi: [-pi/2,pi/2], theta: [-pi,pi]). Or alternatively use a circle in the xy plane, progress through the z axis linearly (e.g. z=i) and use sqrt(1-sqr(z)) as radius for the circle in xy.<br />
<br />
5. 3D DM's are a complicated topic. I usually use raytracing, but you can also use the superscope principle on DM's. In any case, even if you had a base 3DDM, you would probably not get far because you need to know what you're doing.

		Sorry for bumping, but I decide to keep my questions to 1 topic... keeping the forums tidy and neat-like :p <br />
<br />
Anyways, I just got a new question :<br />
<br />
Is it possible to group points in the SSC, such as 1000-point scope grouped into 10 sets, numbered 1-10... or each group valued ascending-ly in some sort...<br />
<br />
Err, let me (kinda) simplify :<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make a value increase by &quot;a&quot; every &quot;b&quot; points in a SSC?<br />
<br />
I doubt I have any other questions... Thanks for anyone who answers this one =)

		You hafta use the modulus (%) to do that. It's a little slow, but it works. What the modulus does is return the remainder of division between a and b. So, for example, 12%10 returns 2. 3%5 returns 3.<br />
Here's a sample:<br />
<br />
Init: n = 10;<br />
Frame: a = 0; b = 0;<br />
Point: a = a + 1; b = b + equal(a % 10, 0 )<br />
<br />
What that does is increase b every 10th a, and then resets them every frame.

		Actually, I don't think modulus is that much slower than any other operator.<br />
Another example is:<br />
a=(a+1)%10; b=if(a,b,b+1);<br />
a goes from 0 to 9, then wraps back to zero every tenth frame.  b increases only when a isn't unequal to zero (or, equal to zero, when you look around avs's psuedologic).

		It depends on what AVS calculates as modulus. I think it just uses the combined integer divide/modulus instruction. Note that this instruction is still faster than a floating point divide w/ modulus.
