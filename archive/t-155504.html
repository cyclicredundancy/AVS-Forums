      <p class="post-content"><strong>Winamp5 Visualization Studio</strong><br />
      HI, I'm using Winamp3 and contrary to Winamp2 the visualizations run infinitely more faster in fullscrean (overlay mode 640x480x16bits). What makes this big difference between the Visualization Studios of Winamp2 and Wianamp3? and why Winamp5 seems to have the same VIS studio of Winamp2 if this was to much slowy than Winamp3's VIS studio? Why?:cry:<br />
      I'm running Winamp3 and Winamp5 in this pc:<br />
      Athlon 2400+<br />
      512 PC2700 ram<br />
      Ati AIW radeon 32MB<br />
      WinXP Pro SP1</p>

      <p class="post-content">Firstly, Winamp (1.x, 2.x, 5.x) and Winamp3 are two different programs/products. However, AVS is practically the same in both players, though the latest version (v2.7pre8) is in Winamp 5.0<br />
      <br />
      I'm moving this from wa3-dis to the AVS forum, where the experts there should be able to help you setup AVS to run as fast and smoothly as possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are few differences between the different versions of AVS up until the newest releases with WA5. The version that came with WA3 was actually a good bit buggier. And it should also have run slower seeing as how WA3 uses up a good bit more system resources. I think the opposite effect must have happened because of some other reasons - background processes, etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's the 16 bits! AVS 2.51 for WA3 has 'fast software bpp conversion'. Try to run your graphics card at 32 bits, AVS is a lot faster that way.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually I suspect it's the pixel doubling which is turned on by default in Winamp3. Which anyone with half an eye for detail would notice when comparing the 2 results.</p>

      </blockquote>:D YES, you're right UnConeD, cheking the pixel doubling option in Winamp5's VIS run equal or even better than Winamp3's VIS.<br />
      THANKS A LOT!!! ;)
