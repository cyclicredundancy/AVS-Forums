Has Anyone kept track of all of the APEs available at this time?<br />

<div class="posttext">Yeah but this thread is a horrible solution really.<br />
<br />
People will start reading from the beginning and download the older apes, and only if they keep on reading will they find the newer versions.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can't package up my other apes on devart. But there's a problem there too... it's best to submit each as separate item, because that's easier to locate and update, but if people need to download them all by hand, they'll be pissed too...</div></div><hr />

If we're going to do this, we need to do it good:<br />
<br />
- sort by trans/misc/render/..<br />
- keep track of versions<br />
- summarize function of each ape<br />
- direct download link (you can copy the link from an attachment or use an outside URL)<br />

We could also include non-finalized apes (such as shreyas' dynamic clearscreen) and development betas (like customfilter.ape) with a clear mention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">:winamp: Here's an idea: Someone should create a site for APE developers to upload their creations to.<br />
<br />
A little CSS, PHP, and MySQL would do it. (there are many ways to do it)<br />
<br />
The APE developers would then provide the description, version number, date, etc... with the ability to update the file.<br />
<br />
To get the site up and running sooner so that we can all take advantage of this, the webmaster should get the site up with no uploads (yet) and take submissions via email. One update a week (if nessesary, or every fortnight) on Mondays would give the APE developers time to work on them during the weekend. This would talke care of the security issues while you finish coding the real site with a backend database (e.g. Deviant Art but with file updates and APE history).<br />
<br />
A solution like this would benefit everyone of us around the table. Those who create APEs or AVS presets and those who need the APE to run a preset. If the webmaster proves to be trustworthy, then we can link there and replace this thread. Please keep in mind that I'm talking about APE files specifically not AVS preset packs (though the site suggested at the link sounds great).<br />

<div class="posttext">How about making it a part of the AVS website? We don't need a whole new website for APEs... besides, the AVS website won't be too heavy on traffic...<br />
Oh, and for that to happen, we need the APE developers to show their true programming skills and help code such thing :)<br />
We'll also need good server space and donations... (Or multiple free websites)<br />
We're still quite a distance from an AVS website, but we're getting there...<br />
For now DeviantART is the best place. (Especially once DAv3 comes out...)<br />
<br />
P.S. : Sig size limit, 3 lines. I also believe you can think of a better nickname...(and what should be call you with such nick?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:winamp: None of us have any idea when the (proposed) AVS site will pop up. In the mean time, we have the winamp, deviant art etc... websites for distribution of the presets. I'd like to see a central location for APEs soon. Precisely because It's a small part of the AVS package it's a good reason to have one soon, it'll be easy to maintain. Having to read a long thread is tedious, I'd rather spend my time tweaking presets. ;)<br />
<br />
Atero, I posted it here because I started the conversation here. If the moderators want to move it it's ok by me! :)<br />
<br />
Nic01, I'll see if I can crunch my sig a bit. ;) It has a bit of wasted space... true.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The website will pop up as soon as we have enough content and when i'm done with the layout.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] <br />
Of course there will be a place for APE's. But all this is depending on how much material the peopel aound here are going to collect.<br />
<br />
If you want it to be set that quick, take care of it yourself! Go and write what you think should be published, collect all the ape's and their documentations, rezip them and post the whole thing there:<br />

<div class="posttext">Getting a site up takes a LOT of work, because we want a forums type thing, which requires scripting, which requires a good host.  There are no free hosts I know of that will do what we want.  APEs will probably be a later priority because they are released slowly, whereas advice and presets are updated much quicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">...coming back to the AVS website - do you think we need a paid hosting? If we only need free hosting, the best provider I know is www.h11.ru - PHP, MySQL, pretty good speed, FTP access, SSH and other stuff. The only bad thing is banner and popups  :(<br />
If you want a nice domain name and no popups/banners, than we can make all give some money via PayPal or something to the person who will do the hosting (I recomend UCD as the most responsabile one here :)).<br />
I can do web-design/css/flash stuff, for forum we can use http://www.phpbb.com - it's free, it's php and it's very customizible (I know I have a typo here), I have a friend here who'll do anything in php.<br />
