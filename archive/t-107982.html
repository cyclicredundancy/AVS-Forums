      <p class="post-content"><strong>International VJ festival - AVIT</strong><br />
      All those with an interest in visuals to music of any kind and in the UK or nearby should come along to <a href="http://www.avit.org.uk/html/index.php" target="_blank">AVIT</a> on the Saturday 12th October.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.avit.org.uk/html/index.php" target="_blank">AVIT</a> is an international VJ festival held this year in Leeds, UK with VJ's from all over the world. I think there are about 50 coming so far and I will be there representing the real time sound reactive side of things.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully showcasing all the latest work in the world of visualizations (New MilkDrop stuff, Monkey, R3 and maybe even Geiss 2 oh and maybe some AVS too if it is worthy :);)) to educate the masses.<br />
      <br />
      Entry free for the workshops/seminars in the daytime/early evening.<br />
      And a paying club night (2,000+ people capacity) at night with a top line of DJ's.<br />
      <br />
      There will be like 20+ projector/screens at the event. Visual overload. If you can come along and show your support.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Aw man... Leeds is miles away and I'm skint at the moment.<br />

      I maybe there, I may not, depends on the money situation. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">There will be people recording the event and such so there will be downloadable recording of the event afterwards. I will post all links here.:)<br />
      <br />
      We are trying to get an live webcast feed but I do not think that will be doable. Although I think there is an Internet cafe in the shopping centre (which will be turned into the club for the night time.:) )<br />
      <br />
      We are hopefully getting Channel 4 to do TV show or something (or sell them our footage afterwards) but it will probably end up on some crappy cable station if at all. I think some foriegn TV channels might have an interest too. I will let you know if I have any more details.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know why it wasn't in London myself. :) It will probably be in another country next year. :)<br />
      <br />
      I trying to help all the international Vj get sorted from flying into the London airports as Leeds/Bradford is tiny.:)<br />
      <br />
      Oh do you guys know of anywhere else (forums, etc) that I could spread the word.</p>

      </blockquote>Goes to show how much you know.:);):p<br />
      <br />
      VJ's are generally play clips of stuff (video, prerendered CG stuff, etc) triggered via the video mixer and/or midi.<br />
      <br />
      There is very little (none really) real time sound reactive stuff. And the quailty of decent plug-ins can easily give that. The sound reactive stuff is my main selling point as they cannot do that.<br />
      <br />
      Loads of VJ's play there sets in low rees which to them is 400x300 or below :eek: necause that is what a lot of teh s/w palys it att and many industry standard video mixers only run at broadcast quailty res i.e. PAL/NTSC which is not all that.<br />
      <br />
      I intend using the visualizations as another 'layer' with film clips, camera feed on top of it.<br />
      <br />
      The VJ crews I have meet know I can add a lot to there sets. The 'professional' VJ software is often done in a bad way and is not really all that.:(

      <br />
      This would be really cool if you could submit AVS for the festival....Unfortunately I'm a wee 14 y/o (and in the states, no less), so I'm obviously not going to catch a plane to the UK just to fuel a hobby of mine :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">likewise, its a slim chance that anyone other than the <i>really</i> dedicated european VJ's will be there (if they have money to fly it means they sold out or arent all that dedicated after all)<br />
      <br />
      damn, it would be cool to go tho<br />

      <p class="post-content">100,000 a night?<br />
      in US Dollars?<br />
      that seems pretty fucking steep<br />
      i wouldnt pay any more than 100<br />
      but than again, i am a cheap ass, and id proably be doing it myself<br />
      <br />
      (TV-out is soooo much cheapers, compatible, and easier than a projecter)</p>

      <p class="post-content">...point well-taken<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      (but once again, the cost/profit ratio for even an ok tv (or perhaps expect your client to have the PC and tv, you just bring the coax cable) is waaaaaay less than a nice projector)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      (and projectors can make ravers on E go blind if they look at the light too much :D)</p>
