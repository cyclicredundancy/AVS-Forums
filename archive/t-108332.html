AVS should be open source so that we can make the fixes and changes ourselves. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just open-sourcing it won't work. We'd need an open development environment where everyone can submit patches and/or additions and work together to create a better AVS. But none of this would work without Nullsoft re-occupying itself with AVS' development.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yes, w/out proper control of the source, itd branch off like a bitch<br />
<br />
<br />
but i still think itd be schweet to have all those problems (in the wishlist) fixed<br />
<br />
itd be super sweet</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you know all of these things??<br />
<br />
I've got it! You are omniscient, that would explain a lot of things...<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that if it were done it would need to be well organised, otherwise it would just be a huge waste of time. Some kind of arrangement where by some small group is 'in charge' of making the code additions and everyone else just submits their bits to them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i think im understanding what  you are saying<br />
but if it what i think it is (some rebel group on endor has secured the AVS code) :-D <br />
then why doesnt everyone know about it?<br />
or maybe you made a flawless decomplier, but you wont share<br />
maybe you are saying &quot;im fucking with your heads&quot;<br />
<br />
iono, but anyways, stuff getting fixed is cool<br />
<br />
therefore; (once again) AVS should be quasiopensource<br />
with an elite group of monke-...programmers fixing the code<br />
<br />
:up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, so I take it that you are fixing things yourself then. That sounds good to me.. perhaps you could add arrays to superscope whilst your at it? :D<br />
<br />
Actually if you are going to do some fixes please make sure you get that crappy DM bug where it gets put in the wrong place in the effect list.<br />

Maybe a disassembler or a hex editor. If you like torturing yourself by coding raw assembly then these are exceptable options.<br />

Well, if things are being fixed then I'm happy. Regardless as to how its happening.<br />

<div class="posttext">I'm currently working on a Render / Picture replacement that does JPEG/PNG (and ofcourse still BMP) supports bilinear filtering and more output modes.<br />

That's on the wishlist, isn't it? :)</div></div><hr />

You got my hopes up about somethings though. :(</div></div><hr />
