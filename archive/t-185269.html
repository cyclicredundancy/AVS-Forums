			<strong>Text + Random presets</strong><br />
		
		

		The &quot;problem&quot; is simple... I need a solution from you gurus :)<br />
<br />
I'm working in a club as a VJ<br />
Recently our club bought plasma screens... the only decent software I found (and I must say that it totally rocks!) for pretty visualisations was  AVS (well, not actually a software... just a plugin :P)<br />
<br />
Now the actual &quot;problem&quot; is that I'm not that experimented with AVS...<br />
What I'm trying to do is to randomly load presets from a directory, while having some text appearing once every  X minutes...  like &quot;next week, Dj hot-dude at 1am&quot; and stuff like that... I'm pretty sure you guys got the idea...<br />
I tried playing with the text renderer... but it doesn't have too many features... I didn't even got it how to write &quot;stuff&quot; on a new line... I'm not even talking about setting it once every X minute :P<br />
<br />
I played with AVS before and created some presets for me @ home... but never anything too complicated....<br />
<br />
So, if you guys know a solution to my &quot;problem&quot;, or if you know some software/plugin/you name it that has the required features please reply me... I'm getting desperate trying to figure it out :igor:<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...

		In the faq is explained how to make avs stop cycling random trough presets, you can turn it back on the same way.

		no... I wasn't asking that... I know how to do that..<br />
and I know how tu use the search button :)<br />
<br />
Lemme try explain it a little bit better....<br />
Let's say I want something similar to  &quot;Effect List&quot;<br />
&quot;Render / Text&quot; should be displayed once every X seconds... <br />
so... basically... how can I make a preset randomly load another preset every let's say 30 seconds ?

		You mean loading a preset within another preset, but the text stays? Don't think it can be done.<br />
<br />
Better try using another program (PowerPoint or so) with the Overlay color as background

		Look for AVS Hotlist which is a VJ tool for AVS. You can make your own presets easily with the desired text on them and queue them in hotlist.
