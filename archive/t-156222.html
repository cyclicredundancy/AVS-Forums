<br />
<div class="posttext">Colormap and Texer will be included in AVS2.7 as a separate .ape file (not integrated like channelshift and the others).<br />
<br />
These are the final versions so you can use the new features. You don't need to spread these around anymore.<br />
<br />
Texer 2 should be included into AVS as well (as .ape file), but I need to finish the help before I can send off the final version. Waiting for the last APE API update.<br />

<br />
Changes to cmap:<br />
- Fixed bug where cmap wouldn't cycle if you closed the avs editor while editing a cmap.<br />
- Removed links to acko.net (no n00bies on acko plz :weird: )<br />
- Added cycle speed for cmap<br />
- Added noskip option: if turned on, a transition will always be completed until the next is started, even if more beats occur during the transition.<br />
<br />
Texer:<br />
- No functional changes</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">noskip feature will be very good.<br />
Thanks for this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">great to hear it'll all be in wa5, and that we don't need to spread them around with installers. <br />
<br />
Great work, UnconeD :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">about the noskip feature. If we wanted to synch effects so that, for example, a dm morphs at the same time, we would need to build in our own noskip code into the dm. <br />
<br />
So, how does the morphing between maps work? is the speed static, or is it per frame? And if so, how could we come to an equivilant in ssc/dm code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">and why don't you ever add a function that will still switch even when there's still morphing going on, but will do a smooth interpolation into the next map instead of cutting off the previous map altogether?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah well i would  like to see a smooth transition option there.(is it too tough to code?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hm... here is a bug in texer, xor sometimes doesn't give the xor effect... i attach file.  i get reds and blues, but never any greens</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th November 2003, 10:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I found this also. Dont worry though ucd, after a bit of experimenting, i found its not the XOR code that is at fault, its the resizing. <br />
<br />
The bilinear filtering over the resized texer image is enough to change each channel by a the smallest amount, and we all know how touchy XOR is. <br />
<br />
What i suspect was happening is that the green parts ar turned down maybe just one point (of 255), and the other parts get their green channel marked up just a  point or two. Now the binaries is all messy. so after it is xored it is completely weirded up.<br />
<br />
//edit.. looks like i was somewhat wrong. Example, get a single white texer bit on a black background. Put xoring on. Put resizing on. <br />
<br />
Purple???!??  :eek:<br />
<br />
i guess my theory doesnt really account for this. Anyone know wtf is happening here?<br />
<br />
//edit2 conclusion: when resizing in enabled, green color channel is ignored for XOR blend mode only.. :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">here: a nice pretty display of xoring over 3 texers<br />
<br />
now, put on the resizing and cry.<br />

<div class="posttext">oh, btw everyone else. This is a texer2 bug, nothing to do with this thread.<br />
:eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">O__o  The size of these files blows me away - 40kb colormap (I remember it was 68) and 28 (!) kb texer... a LOT of code optimizing I guess :p<br />
<br />
Yathosho will like new versions - PimpBot generated installers will be even smaller :D<br />
<br />
Thankyou thankyou!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You didn't really pay attention now did you.<br />
<br />
Oh and the size reducing is because of me flicking around with compiler settings. Optimizations won't affect code size much.</div></div><hr />
