<div class="posttext">How about we have some sort of big avs tournament. Like lets say 15 people started out a title is given and a week later all the entries are collected and judged and the bottom 3 are excluded and out of the tournament. Then lather, rinse and repeat until the final where 3 people compete on the final one. There are no limits to what you can put in the presets but FPS is a judging criteria, other judging criteria could be creatiovity with the title, so you would get more interesting presets for the title. What do you think? Start pointing out complications and problems, i think i'll go to bed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Is the goal to improve the preset every round, or do you have ot create something new every time? It would be a good way to breed top-quality stuff otherwise.</div></div><hr />

My sources tell me (tuggummi tells me) that he is just oging home for the holidays, and will be back after.<br />

Toournament sounds great, though it will require a lot more organisation than the miserable flow competition.<br />

I'm not good at judging I guess, I'd only look to the ending preset, and the speed, not at how it is build up.<br />

Hope I can enter :), I'd like to give it a shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that makes 3 judges already, if accepted :)<br />
<br />
question: How far may you go &quot;improving&quot; you preset, before it turns into a wholly new one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2003, 13:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">*sigh*, i can see this ending in yet more petty arguments. My original idea was to have a different title each week and have the people each make a preset, see who can make a good preset but also be creative with the title, then the bottom few are eliminated from the tournament. Then end of the week, a new title. A week to be creative and make a preset, bottom few are eliminated. And we continue until the final. New title, week, best one wins.<br />
<br />
I really really don't see how improiving the preset each week would work. People would just have a preset built and take bits off before they released. I can see that not working out at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2003, 14:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">im with raz.. the improving idea sounds good in theory, but i dont think it is really practicle to improve upon a single preset more than once or twice. Plus, after the first couple of weeks the tournament would start to get pretty dull.<br />
<br />
so far we have:<br />
<br />
10 contestants:<br />
raz, unconed, shreyas, sidd, Phazey, Nic01, Jheriko, Zevensoft, Deamon, Skupers, <br />
<br />
3 judges:<br />
ishan, Doggy dogg, anubis<br />
<br />
It doesnt matter how many enter, its not going to be knockout tree format, so we dont have to think about an certain number of people. eg as it is we can eliminate two each round for 5 rounds: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, winner<br />
<br />
or something like this: 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, winner<br />
<br />
it depends on how long you want it to go for... <br />
<br />
there are still some notables that havnt spoken up yet. ie Atero, stardust, and fsk maybe.. so we maybe should wait a bit..<br />
<br />
these are all just suggestions, i think raz should be decisions man, seeing as its his idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree to Raz. After two or three weeks improving will get harder and harder and we'll see almost the same presets. <br />
<br />
New Week, new title, new preset is fine for me. In my opinion the only alternative was to have some kind of remix tournament, where all competitors start with the same preset and try to improve this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">8 weeks really is big period of time...Raz`s original idea is great,lets keep it that way.As for the title,we could open a new thread and everyone gives some ideas(1 or 2 per person).But ONLY ideas so no postpumping or LOL @ X or anything else.For example : Endurance. Souns like a nice name to me. :D<br />
10 &lt;-&gt; 7 &lt;-&gt; 4 &lt;-&gt; 1 |___|___|___| 3 weeks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2003, 16:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I say the judges come up with the titles because people who are entering could come up with titles that suit their already made presets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mquadrat</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2003, 20:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes and the titles should be secret until they are released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree totally with Raz. Every week a new given title given to us by the judges, and a totally new preset should be made with it. So, when do we start? ;)</div></div><hr />

What about that ^? I say we take one thread(qualifying) for the all enteries first (no matter how many) then select ten best contestents for the Main tournament</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2003, 08:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's not practical unless you have 15 or more contestants.<br />
If runar is the only &gt;10th joiner, then we can just do the 3-week setting with 4 eliminated in the first week.<br />
For others, change the 2nd part to 8. (and perhaps 9 for 14)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And what if someone else wants to enter in the middle?<br />
I think we should promote this contest to get in atleast 20 contestants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Entering after the decided date should not be allowed.Cause that will make it unfair for those who have been eliminated in the first round. I think around 20 contestents should be enough(I doubt that many will come though).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Damn, i wont be here the next 2 weeks. But i'll try to get it done on weekends.<br />
<br />
Just a idea: the participants could judge which is best, except their own presets. They'll give points and they're summed up to a final score. The final votes could be something special, like a voting topic.<br />
<br />
As this aint a short time thing, i would prefere 2 weeks creativity + one week judging and new topic developement. You know, there are peopel who don't come here that often.</div></div><hr />

In other words Im in deeeep sheeeet,so its OK to say im out.<br />

<div class="posttext">I don't agree with that at all, as long as there's more than one judge they can come up with a decent and fair decision in all my experience. That would just lead to more complications and subsequently more arguments and disputes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm definitely not participating due to lack of time... basically what was wrong with the last contest:<br />
- Rules too strict/unclear (doesn't apply now)<br />
- Judges posted their results before everyone had finished voting.<br />
- Judges knew who made which preset.<br />
<br />
A better approach is to have a coordinator, who DOESN'T vote, receive all the entries. He then renames them to numbers (random order) and sends them off to the judges.<br />
<br />
That's the only way to get complete fairness...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">um..have i started this too early?? if yes we can get a mod to delete the thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, basically I rwads the tournament thread before this one, and I now think that ucd's idea is great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's indeed a very good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 07:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yea, the idea is good . So do we have to get the other thread deleted?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">We can save this up for next round, because now peopel who already subitted would have to do new presets.<br />
<br />
AND: Please open a sperate Thread for each round otherwise there will be a 250+ entries thread in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 07:53</div></div>

<div class="posttext">It would be appropritate for a sticky thread and keep doing tournaments in there but lets not get into that ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree, provided that the devart and i wanna be steve wittens thread get unstickied. They have nothing to do with avs in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 09:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">they can go to the avs presets sub forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">NO damn sticky! Enough stickies.Now,are the &quot;rules&quot; going to change here again or what ? Btw,it would have been more cooler if judges would give a title like a word or a metaphoric proposition and we use our imagination in making a preset that suits the word.*end of my idea*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 10:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I go with you Phaze, because Ishan already implied we HAVE to use Alpha Blending.<br />
<br />
A much better title would have been something like &quot;Spherical Dimensions&quot; or so.<br />
<br />
Anyway this can be done better next round, for Chrissake don't change anything now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 11:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I also totally agree on the name thingie. It was supposed to be a contest to see who is creative with names, not with blending tricks etc. Otherwise I bet the &quot;title&quot; for next week is 3D scoping or something like that, instead of a abstract name which requires imagination, not technique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 17:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok i get you guys! it'll be in the next round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Runar</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 17:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">But please don't judge this asking &quot;Who's got the best and most flashy/advanced alpha blending?&quot;, ask &quot;Which is the best preset and has the most original use of alpha blending?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 17:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's true runar, but I think showing some advanced skill with alpha blending would definitely help - especially if it's really original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th June 2003, 17:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">*sigh* i never thought judging would be so tough!<br />
I realise i have done a big mistake:( i was in too much hurry, i should have waited before everything was finalised.<br />
What can i do now?</div></div><hr />

By The Way: What about a Tournament Pack ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st June 2003, 15:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">aw that sucks. I would have thought a very cool title for my preset...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd June 2003, 07:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The tournament pack would be very big i guess we would have like:<br />
20 presets- 1st week<br />
15 presets- 2nd week<br />
10 preests- 3rd week<br />
05 presets- 4th week<br />
--------------------<br />
50 Presets total<br />
<br />
is'nt that too much?:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd June 2003, 07:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">not at all...<br />
i think it would be nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd June 2003, 07:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok then we could do it afterwards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th June 2003, 22:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, the pack isn't going to be that big - We only got 12 presets in the first round.<br />
<br />
For next round, I think we should have the judges that aren't participating in the tournament, as well as one &quot;judge&quot; whose points are assigned according to everyone else's votes - we could maybe do a poll where everyone is allowed to choose their top one or two presets.  Just an idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th June 2003, 22:49</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, let's do that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th June 2003, 23:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't like it. Unecessary complications that will lead to it taking ages and people arguing. Keep it as simple as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th June 2003, 06:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, i like the way it is right now.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th June 2003, 06:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">true raz.<br />
I think we should keep this as simple as possible, us avsers arnt the quickest of cats at the best of times when it comes to sorting out complications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th June 2003, 11:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Now for the next round, let's be it a name contest and not some technique race like alpha blending or 3D scoping :p. Creativity is what this contest is all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th June 2003, 16:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah , were thinking about it.</div></div><hr />
