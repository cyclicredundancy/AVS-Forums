      How about we have some sort of big avs tournament. Like lets say 15 people started out a title is given and a week later all the entries are collected and judged and the bottom 3 are excluded and out of the tournament. Then lather, rinse and repeat until the final where 3 people compete on the final one. There are no limits to what you can put in the presets but FPS is a judging criteria, other judging criteria could be creatiovity with the title, so you would get more interesting presets for the title. What do you think? Start pointing out complications and problems, i think i'll go to bed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that makes 3 judges already, if accepted :)<br />
      <br />
      question: How far may you go "improving" you preset, before it turns into a wholly new one?</p>

      <p class="post-content">*sigh*, i can see this ending in yet more petty arguments. My original idea was to have a different title each week and have the people each make a preset, see who can make a good preset but also be creative with the title, then the bottom few are eliminated from the tournament. Then end of the week, a new title. A week to be creative and make a preset, bottom few are eliminated. And we continue until the final. New title, week, best one wins.<br />
      <br />
      I really really don't see how improiving the preset each week would work. People would just have a preset built and take bits off before they released. I can see that not working out at all.</p>

      <p class="post-content">im with raz.. the improving idea sounds good in theory, but i dont think it is really practicle to improve upon a single preset more than once or twice. Plus, after the first couple of weeks the tournament would start to get pretty dull.<br />
      <br />
      so far we have:<br />
      <br />
      10 contestants:<br />
      raz, unconed, shreyas, sidd, Phazey, Nic01, Jheriko, Zevensoft, Deamon, Skupers,<br />
      <br />
      3 judges:<br />
      ishan, Doggy dogg, anubis<br />
      <br />
      It doesnt matter how many enter, its not going to be knockout tree format, so we dont have to think about an certain number of people. eg as it is we can eliminate two each round for 5 rounds: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, <b>winner</b><br />
      <br />
      or something like this: 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, <b>winner</b><br />
      <br />
      it depends on how long you want it to go for...<br />
      <br />
      there are still some notables that havnt spoken up yet. ie Atero, stardust, and fsk maybe.. so we maybe should wait a bit..<br />
      <br />
      these are all just suggestions, i think raz should be decisions man, seeing as its his idea.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree to Raz. After two or three weeks improving will get harder and harder and we'll see almost the same presets.<br />
      <br />
      New Week, new title, new preset is fine for me. In my opinion the only alternative was to have some kind of remix tournament, where all competitors start with the same preset and try to improve this one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Entering after the decided date should not be allowed.Cause that will make it unfair for those who have been eliminated in the first round. I think around 20 contestents should be enough(I doubt that many will come though).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Damn, i wont be here the next 2 weeks. But i'll try to get it done on weekends.<br />
      <br />
      Just a idea: the participants could judge which is best, except their own presets. They'll give points and they're summed up to a final score. The final votes could be something special, like a voting topic.<br />
      <br />
      As this aint a short time thing, i would prefere 2 weeks creativity + one week judging and new topic developement. You know, there are peopel who don't come here that often.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmmm this sounds tempting but I'm too busy saveing my lazy^2 ass in school, to participate:(. im haveing a contest with myself right now, I have to design 2 DJ bags, a book, a poster, a buisnes card and more in two weeks (till 1st of june).After that I still have that flash project and PD4 if im lucky:((.<br />
      In other words Im in deeeep sheeeet,so its OK to say im out.<br />
      <br />
      p.s. if you have any cool ideas for a DJ bag/box(for LPs)send me a mail :D and good luck with the tournament.</p>

      <p class="post-content">agreed, though the idea of contestants judging except their own presets aint bad, it works better than you think. I guess everyone in here is fair enough not to play dirty with another. There is no victory in winning by cheating.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't agree with that at all, as long as there's more than one judge they can come up with a decent and fair decision in all my experience. That would just lead to more complications and subsequently more arguments and disputes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, was only a suggestion.

      <p class="post-content">I'm definitely not participating due to lack of time... basically what was wrong with the last contest:<br />
      - Rules too strict/unclear (doesn't apply now)<br />
      - Judges posted their results before everyone had finished voting.<br />
      - Judges knew who made which preset.<br />
      <br />
      A better approach is to have a coordinator, who DOESN'T vote, receive all the entries. He then renames them to numbers (random order) and sends them off to the judges.<br />
      <br />
      That's the only way to get complete fairness...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I also totally agree on the name thingie. It was supposed to be a contest to see who is creative with names, not with blending tricks etc. Otherwise I bet the "title" for next week is 3D scoping or something like that, instead of a abstract name which requires imagination, not technique.</p>

      For next round, I think we should have the judges that aren't participating in the tournament, as well as one "judge" whose points are assigned according to everyone else's votes - we could maybe do a poll where everyone is allowed to choose their top one or two presets. Just an idea...</p>
