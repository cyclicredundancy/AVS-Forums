      <p class="post-content"><strong>Artist and song name</strong><br />
      When I play song, its basic information is shown for only few seconds.<br />
      I would like to have artist and song name shown on visualization screen for whole time (since the song starts till it ends). How to do that?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm?<br />
      AVS doesn't overlay any song info like that, although presets for it can can.<br />
      Are you sure you're not using Milkdrop rather than AVS?<br />
      <br />
      To add the artist + song name to an AVS preset, so it's always show you simply need to:<br />
      - Add a render -&gt; Text<br />
      - Drag it down to the bottom (if it's not already, so it's drawn last)<br />
      - In the text to display box put: $(title)<br />
      - Fiddle with other text options to taste<br />
      <br />
      But that will only affect the current AVS preset.</p>

      </blockquote>it does that by default, guess most people have it disabled ("Suppress title text")

      <p class="post-content">Oh wow, you're right. Well I'll take that back then.<br />
      Guess it's been awhile since I've seen that turn on.<br />
      <br />
      Of course it's still true that the only way for the song title to be shown all the time is to modify presets to display it. (Or custom build of AVS but there would just be too much hassle trying to get it to build correctly.)</p>
