		I've been sifting through www.winamp.com and www.nullsoft.com, and I simply can't find anything that satisfies my need either way. I would like to know if I would be allowed to use the AVS program (though no copywrited designs, those I use would be my own creations) as a background layer for text, images, etc etc. There's only so much you can do with an airbrush, after all.<br />
<br />
I'll give more info as needed, but not like..out here publicly. You guys should have my e-mail addy, so have someone who's able to tell me straight and NOT give me the run-around send me an e-mail. Thank ya kindly, Nullsoft. And, I LOVE your programs. I use Winamp instead of..well, almost anything! Winamp just plain rocks, AVS follows suit with a full dose of kick assiness. Keep up the awesome work!<br />
&lt;/asskiss&gt; (HTML joke, if you don't get it don't ask)

		To end any HTML tag, you put a / in the front of the tag. For instance, a URL tag would look like this:<br />
<br />
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.winamp.com&quot;&gt;Winamp, Really Whips a Llama's Ass&lt;/A&gt;<br />
<br />
Notice the &lt;/A&gt;? That tells the program viewing the HTML that it's time to stop reading that as a link (A HREF=link). <br />
<br />
So, I was jokingly hinting that I was kissing up to the programmers of AVS...
