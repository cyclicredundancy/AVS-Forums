      <p class="post-content"><strong>What happened with bitmaps rendering?!</strong><br />
      Damn, all worked good day before... I downloaded and installed new plugins and AVS presets. They are:<br />
      <br />
      Scopeguru_AVS<br />
      Hybrids_720<br />
      Tuggumi-innovation<br />
      DreamRender3<br />
      <br />
      I tried DreamRender but it worked slow on WinXP. I deinstalled it. After this I tried all presets shown above. Nothing wrong until I started my own presets VU-meters. DAMN! Computer goes too slow. Studio.exe sucks 85% of processor time. VU-meters show frame rate about 11 fps. BUT WHY?! It worked with about 50 fps! And colors in bitmaps are distorted. I started examine what part of them works wrong. After some time I found - when I switch off bitmap rendering - all start work fast and fine (but without background of course). Looks like some of presets or even DreamRender replaced or added WACs. I reinstalled WinAmp (over, not remove) but it wont' help. I tried some other presets with bitmaped background - same result. 85% of processor time lost for rendering without any reason.<br />
      <br />
      What's wrong? What can I do to restore previous productivity? Are there any ways to fix this problem except remove WinAmp and install it (and all working presets and tunes) again?</p>

      <p class="post-content">From now looks like DreamRender 3 broken AVS. Probably it replaced some dlls. That means deinstallation of WinAmp can be useless. Anybody knowing internals of WinAmp3 - which dll works with bitmaps in AVS 2.5.1? Wich dll has to be restored?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Dreamrender is shit, I don't know why you'd bother installing it. But to fix the picture issue, I think reinstalling windows should work, or perhaps finding replacements for the core dlls (gdi32.dll, user.dll, etc.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why the HELL does a Winamp plug-in need to replace the GDI and USER dll's? These are CORE components of Windows!<br />
      <br />
      GDI = Graphical Device Interface, i.e. everything that is drawn on the screen<br />
      <br />
      USER = User &lt;-&gt; Computer interface, i.e. mouse, keyboard, windows, etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you tried DreamRender?? It basically is a new GUI, everything attempts to be hardware accelerated. The desktop icons become blurry (A sign of mipmapping), the desktop is 3D, and the famous Z-artifacts. I guess the only way they could do this was to modify core windows files. Windowblinds does the same.<br />
      <br />
      Also render/picture most likely uses StretchBlt, which would explain why it's so slow.</p>

      <p class="post-content">DAMN! I found sequence restoring original framerate for bitmaped presets. After I change twice "Keep aspect ratio" in picture settings - then all start go right. But TWICE - turn it off and on again. Looks like a bug.<br />
      <br />
      Probably one of presets I downloaded (not DreamRender) changed this setting in some way. I found sevreal new APEs in avs dir. Dont' know yet wich one changes this setting.<br />
      <br />
      But DreamRender anywhere is shit... Slow, ugly and not free.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fooo... It is defintely a bug in WinAmp3. Read this until end please.<br />
      <br />
      1. After some actions with picture rendering WinAmp crashed. I remember that I changed Keep aspect ratio again.<br />
      2. I run WinAmp3, opened bitmaped preset (not mine) and viola - it runs slowly again. 85-90% of processor time goes to Studio.exe<br />
      3. I tried repeat changnes of Keep aspect ratio. No help. After some changes WinAmp crashed.<br />
      4. I started it and created empty preset. First action was - + Picture rendering. I didnt' choose picture but clicked to Keep aspect ratio. Empty preset, no picture selected. WinAmp crashed immediately.<br />
      5. I rebooted system and started Windows98. I have it for 3D games. This system is almost empty. Just needed drivers, no WinAmps, no plugins. I installed WinAmp3 there. Repeated step 4. WinAmp crashed after change of Keep aspect ratio.<br />
      <br />
      This looks like a bug with picture rendering. Manipulations with "Keep aspect ratio" cause slowing down computer or even crash WinAmp without reason.</p>

      2: Have you tried WA2? I don't care what your preference is, WA2 is a shitload more stable than WA3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Finally I found sequence causing bitmaped preset work properly...<br />
      <br />
      1. Turn on overlay mode to allow AVS appear on desktop<br />
      2. Change Keep aspect ratio flag.<br />
      <br />
      Hmmm... I used on thing working on desktop. That was DreamRender.</p>
