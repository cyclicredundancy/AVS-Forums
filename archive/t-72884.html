<div class="posttext">:eek:<br />
HOW THE F****?!<br />
<br />
sola, gimme more of this stuff!! Damn good shit!<br />
<br />
Just one thing: The 'Colouring' fx-list consumes a lot resources...if I deactivate it, i got ~25 fps, if not, ~18 fps. -&gt; Maybe another Colouring method ?<br />
<br />
/me wants more!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know, it's a shame it takes up alot of resourses, :( but the secret to getting it working is in the effect list. :) If you absolutely have to turn something off to get it running good, shut down the bump. It is the least important of the essential effects. This is a pretty easy preset to remix. If anyone wants to remix it, feel free to. But remember that I might want to release it with my new pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I did two remixes:<br />
<br />
Speed Remix -&gt; bump fx deleted<br />
Mini Remix -&gt; A tiny remix (including speedup) which makes the preset<br />
less nervous and more suitable for slower music styles like chillout etc...<br />
<br />
But the Original is still the best one! :D<br />
<br />
edit: I wrote this post before you posted yours :weird:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:up: also very cool!<br />
<br />
but it tends to 'flash' around when playing a quiet part.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, I have two remixes.  One is only good for ambient music, such as Final Fantasy music, or something of that nature.<br />
<br />
The other is a regular AVS, which looks goods to beat reaction.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  The &quot;beautiful&quot; preset will not look nearly as good if you play it with regular music.  Download a midi file, or just run the AVS by itself.<br />
<br />
It is beautiful, though, if played the correct way.<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think of both presets.<br />
<br />
thanx<br />
<br />
P.S.  I'll be including the music file you can listen to first, called Aerith's Song.....then in the next post, I'll post &quot;Beautiful&quot;, and in the third and final post, the &quot;Rainbow Tunnel&quot; AVS.<br />
<br />
And Solamon.....this preset you made is awesome!  And best of all, the remix capabilities are humongous!  Very nice work!<br />

<div class="posttext">And, now , the final remix.<br />
<br />
Rainbow Tunnel...good for beat enhanced music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Two remixes, both much softer than the original:<br />
<br />
Crystals - A simple remix.<br />
Melting Reality - More active, but slower.  Spins 'n flashes 'n blinks.<br />
<br />
Can I put these remixes in my new AVS pack, Chris Cross?  After you put out the original, of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whoops...maybe if I post the remixes you can see them, eh?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Excellent remixes everybody! :) Everyone can feel free to release their remixes in their own packs so long as they agree to wait for me to get my pack sent off first. I would like to be the first to release a preset based on this technique. Thanks guys. :) My pack should be sent of to WinAmp in about a week. I will be releasing the whole pack here on the forum at the same time so when you see my pack &quot;Closer to Demiurgy&quot; appear, you may release your remixes.<br />
<br />
Arron, excellent work again. Especially with Rainbow Tunnel. I notice you have become quite a fan of the colorfade technique. I'm a fan of it as well. It's also really cool that you appreciate Ambient style visuals. Too many people seem to fixate on dance style visuals and that is a shame. I would like to show you another preset I made a while ago called Mutanagen (not a remix of Demiurgy Fractel). It is also for ambient music and uses the colorfade effect. I think you will like it. If you want, let me know and I will post it up to the forum. On a side note, I would say that your presets deviate enough from the core preset to be considered an original so you can release them when you see fit.<br />
<br />
Clang, both of your remixes are sweet! By removing the bump the fractal really cooks! Mini remix is my favorite of the two though. I like how the white space focuses out the colors and brings life to them. :up: Check out this remix I made that uses black space to do a similar thing. I call it the Pluton remix. <br />
<br />
Atero, yours are amazing! They form a duality. One of them, Crystals, has a bright celestial atmosphere while the other Melting Reality has a very dark, inferal tone to it. Definatly very nice! :) I would like to make one suggestion on Crystals though. I think by adding a medium blur at the very end of the preset, you get a final layer of polishing that seems to complete the visual. Just my two cents, spend it where you like. :)<br />
<br />
Check out these two additional remixes I made a while ago. I call the one the pluton remix because I get an underworldly like feeling to it. The other one, celestial zebra is pretty much self explainitary. Tell me what you guys think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wew, took me some time to review all these rmx'es :eek:<br />
But i can't say anything new, sola already said everything :D<br />
<br />
sola, the two rmx'es u did -&gt; :up::up::up:<br />
especially the Celestial rmx, it is something ...well, new in the 'Demiurgy Fractal' generation :)<br />
I tried the same like the pluton rmx by myself, but I ran out of time and I don't have enough skill with the 'colorfade' yet. So u did it already, and it looks cool!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm glad everyone liked the demiurgy fractal. :) I've got about 8 remixes of it in my new pack, all of them different. Hopefully by the end of the day (6 in the morning) my new pack should be posted.</div></div><hr />
