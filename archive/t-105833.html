      <p class="post-content"><strong>Is it possible?</strong><br />
      Could it be possible to add functions like: getsec , getmin , gethour<br />
      to avs (in superscopes and dm's) ?<br />
      If it is, i could do a clock preset :D<br />
      Any other use i don't know, but im sure someone smart would find a lot of use for those functions.<br />
      <br />
      getsec=get the second value from the system clock<br />
      getmin=get the minute value - || -<br />
      gethour=get the hour value - || -</p>

      <p class="post-content">don't you think that a clock preset would be a pile of cack? no offense but it is one of the worst ideas i've heard this week. if you wanted to make a preset that looked like a clock it wouldn't be too hard if you didn't want it to actually be any use for keeping time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can always use a BPM customizer and set it to Arbitrary and 60 BPM...<br />
      <br />
      OnBeat section then becomes OnSecond, and should be accurate as long as the FPS is kept at good speed.<br />
      <br />
      You can always edit my Beat Counter to achieve the effect needed (real clock), and you can always use the Init section to make the clock start at the time you need it to...</p>

      <p class="post-content">pretty cool idea, you could then use an incrementing variable on beat mod 60 to get the seconds then divide by 60 and mod 60 for minutes etc... but it still would look like cack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i already did the clock preset with the custom bpm thing, but i just thought it would be cool if it would show the "real" time :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Anyway if you think it's a "cacky" idea then it is. I can't change your opinions, but is it the end of the world if i suggest something like this?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      "OnBeat section then becomes OnSecond, and should be accurate as long as the FPS is kept at good speed."<br />
      <br />
      I don't think it has anything to do with the speed, since the clock seemed to keep on time even with 5-6 fps.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      "You can always edit my Beat Counter to achieve the effect needed (real clock)"<br />
      <br />
      Edit your stuff? Are you insane? (you know what im talking about, why the hell do you even suggest something like this!)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      "you can always use the Init section to make the clock start at the time you need it to..."<br />
      <br />
      Been there done that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the reason i think it is a bad idea is because no one would ever use those functions in avs and extra unused functions will bring slowdown to all code. avs code is a loose set of very general functions thats what makes it so good, you can make a lot of stuff with out making too many sacrifices.</p>

      *reads thread*<br />
      <br />
      I think that'd be real useful, but not that way. You could much more easily find the BPM in code...Speaking of which, they need a getbpm code.<br />
      <br />
      Actually...you shouldn't even need a function, since it'd be pretty constant. Just use second, minute, hour, and bpm. It'd interfere with some presets that might use those custom variables, but hey, fuck them. They're stupid variables anyway.<br />
