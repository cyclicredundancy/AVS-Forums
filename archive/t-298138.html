      <p class="post-content"><strong>randomly reversing x-direction Trans/Dynamic Movement?</strong><br />
      Hullo all again.<br />
      <br />
      I have a very basic query that is hurting me now after several hours of experimentation.<br />
      Essentially, I am using Trans/Dynamic Movement to change the speed and direction of a Superscope randomly along the x-plane, wo far with limited success. It was easy to get it to change from 0 to either -1 or +1 but not both a neg or pos val together.<br />
      <br />
      The basic structure of the move I am using is: x=x-1/16 ;med speed move to the right.<br />
      <br />
      So in Beat this:<br />
      randspeed=rand(64)+16; (works fine)<br />
      randdir=rand(2)-1; SHOULD random an interger between 0 and 2 and then subtract 1 so I am left with a spread of possible -1,0,+1. (right/nil/left movement)<br />
      <br />
      In Pixel, this:<br />
      x=x+randdir/randspeed;<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, this will only garner results that lean to moving everything either to the right or not at all. For some reason X=X+RANDDIR only ends up with a negative value making for movement to the right and it's driving me insane. The only way to change it to move left is to fiddle the +'s and -'s which is just not right lol.<br />
      Any ideas anyone? Searching the forums did not evoke anyting as neither did dismantling many other avs's. Essentially I am not trying to move the scope, but the falloff generated by it (well, the previously drawn frames of it).<br />
      <br />
      Grateful for any help.<br />
      Cheers, nNem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi, nNemethon!<br />
      <br />
      Rand(x) gives you a random number within the range of x integers, starting from zero (not starting from one).<br />
      So, for rand(2), that's 0 or 1.<br />
      If you want to include 2, that gives you <b>three</b> integers: 0,1 and 2.<br />
      It's a common misunderstanding.<br />
      <br />
      So, your code should read:<br />
      <br />
      randspeed=rand(64)+16;<br />
      randdir=rand(<b>3</b>)-1;<br />
      ---<br />
      x=x+randdir/randspeed;<br />
      <br />
      QOAL's method is better though: by allowing a negative speed you don't need the direction anymore.<br />
      <br />
      Be sure to divide it by more than thousand though (I suggest a number between 10000 and 100000), or it will shift half a window (max) with each frame.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Champion guys, big star and a thank you for both of you. :)<br />
      <br />
      QOAL: Different way of doing things in a simpler, faster design. I had never thought of a negative speed as I was focused on getting that negative direction jammed in there via linear thinking. :)<br />
      <br />
      Warrior: Very good explanation of the rand() fuction call. As I understood the basic instructs within the avs editor, rand(2) encompassed 0,1&amp;2 - not the actuality of 'highest final is closed' order being 0&amp;1 only. I had seen examples for a random colour eg. rr=rand(256)/255... and was trying to work out why they were pushing a for a decimal where it was worthless.<br />
      Regarding QOAL's instructs, I went for that immediately as I already explained, with being neater and looks more impressive too :D. I also bumped up the diviser to 40,000 and is working a charm. I also had a good long look at the supplied zip and so now I can do a quick circle. :D It's also given me ideas of how to better organise lists and routines while being nice and neat and readable so thanks once again. :)<br />
      <br />
      Now all I need to do is work out how to get several layers in parallax to fake a 3d and then how to make a real 3d in volumetric space. :)<br />
      <br />
      Cheers.<br />
