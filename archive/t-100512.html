      Just pick a picture. You can use screenshots from your presets, it's what most people do. Let people know what they're in for. :)<br />
      <br />
      As for the process, it's different than posting in here, but the instruction are pretty easy to follow.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just do what I did...get Animation Shop 3 from Jasc and make all of your presets or some of them (leave some suprises) pumping with maybe a song like Andrew W. K.'s "She is Beautiful" or Moby's "Extreme Ways" or anything by DJ Shadow. It'll work.<br />
      <br />
      Don't believe me? Go to winamp2's site and look for "DarkWasp" presets and see what I did...DarkWasp is an old name of mine.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just a couple suggestions...Hermit, PLEASE type normally. It's harder for people to read 4's, b's and 2's in place of for, be, and to/too. If you have enough energy to type 5 question marks, I don't see why you cant type one extra letter. (can't see why it would b easier 4 u 2 type like this neway - takes 2 much attention to what ur typing)</p>

      And Xion, could you make that sig a lot smaller? Thanx :)<br />
      <br />
      I don't want to sound like a tightass saying this, but it's just a pain to be reading your posts when I have to decipher between four and for, or if there's a bunch of pictures that is five times as big as the actual post. Sorry.</p>

      <p class="post-content">NSIS is a lot better, but harder. However, Jheriko posted an NSIS script ready to copy/paste a bit earlier. You can probably find it by searching. And it's compatible with both WA2 and WA3, while PiMP is only for WA2.</p>
