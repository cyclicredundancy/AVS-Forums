      i used my recent swirling height type DM to make my recent intro more interesting. I got rid of the shadow because it looked stupid on the different heights on the background, i tried to put the shadow on the background but it killed the FPS so i just left it out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The background looks a little too much of retrosquares, why do you mimic people? Or don't you just follow the avs scene? :igor:<br />

      <p class="post-content">its hard not to mimic people any more, most things have been done and not a lot new is possible with the current capabilities of avs. That plus after spending 3 days working on it i realised it looked like retrosquares and i wasnt scrapping it because it looked a bit like someone elses work. Besides i consider it a great acheivment to be able to do something similar to the work of UnConeD.</p>
