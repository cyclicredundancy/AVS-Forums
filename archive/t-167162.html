<div class="posttext">I stumbled on something in AVS that partially slows and suspends certain effects. I think it only works while you are creating new presets of your own because it does not work with any presets that came with winamp5. While you are creating a new preset place the cursor in the bottom right hand corner and right click. Parts of the preset will suspend and slowly change in a different mode. I have found that it does some interesting stuff especially with the Dot Fountain. I have 1 preset that it blows me away with what it does and I think it would be great to have a hot key to enable the effect. Has anyone else noticed this before????</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well i haven't encounted this 'effect' before, but it sounds more like a bug than an actual intended feature :p<br />
<br />
Probably the reason for a slow down is indeed the pushing of the button, because it drains cpu resources. Well maybe not so much with newer OS's, but with NT4 the resource meter jumps to 100% :blah:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes Tuqqummi I know it is not a &quot;WINAMP EFFECT&quot;. I guess what I meant is it &quot;effects&quot; the preset. That does make sense about CPU drainage, I only have a AMD/K6-2/450 and a ATI Rage128pro graphics card with 16mb memory and 320mb Ram on the motherboard. If you could figure out how to do what it does with out CPU drainage I think it would be a great &quot;effect&quot;. I guess you would have to see how it &quot;effects&quot; the presets I have made, and how I use it on &quot;MY PC&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok ..I just tried this preset &quot;cursor effect&quot; or if you like ...Winamp Bug ...I opened up my norton system doctor and setup my CPU sensor and while I run AVS using this 1 preset I am already pulling 96%-97%  CPU usage .... When I use this &quot;cursor effect&quot; it does not draw anymore usage on the CPU at all ...SO... is it a &quot;BUG&quot; ? I am going to call it a &quot;my cursor effect&quot;. Only problem is the message box gets in the way if you have the window opened to a certain size.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The cause is that the spectrum and oscilloscope data is not updated in certain situations:<br />
<br />
- Anywhere a menu is displayed (menu bar, right-click, ...)<br />
- Scrolling the thumb on a scrollbar<br />
- Selecting a color<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
If you want to force this effect, you'll need to custom code effects and store the spectrum and/or oscilloscope data in the megabuf at certain points.<br />

How haven't you noticed that.  You have to use the menus to make a preset.  It's the same effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks UnConeD, I am not that familiar with writing code.I kinda figured there could be a way to force it, and yes it also does it while changing color settings..etc,etc. I knew it did that from the getgo, I just happened to create a batch of presets that it happens to effect in a way I like.Thanks</div></div><hr />
