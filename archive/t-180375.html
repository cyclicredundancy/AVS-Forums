      <p class="post-content">I use also dual monitors, but I couldn't figure out how to make AVS run in the second one in fullscreen, I use it in 1024x768 with pixeldoubling in a single window. Putting it into fullscreen would be much cooler, but I don't know if it is possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I couldn't help noticing that this question comes around every month or so.. And that it isn't in the FAQ section. could that be changed? (looks at UCD) That is, if there is a possible solution of course.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Look in your videocard drivers for an option for Theater Mode or something (expand overlay on secondary monitor).<br />
      <br />
      Then enable overlay mode (regular overlay, not fullscreen overlay) in AVS' Display options.</p>

      Do you know that the theater mode does not run width the overlay which is created by winamp avs?<br />
      <br />
      The normal videoplayback runs perfectly, but not the AVS!<br />
      <br />
      See the following topic:<br />
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=1367750" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....postid=1367750</a><br />
      <br />
      When the theater mode is enabled an you activate the overlay in AVS, the second monitor switch to a black screen and not more.<br />
      The is no visualisation.<br />
      <br />
      I have searched a long time, but I could not solve this problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">you have to make the other monitor the primary one.<br />
      you can do this in the windows display settings and you have to restart winamp afterwords.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the best (and fastest) method ive found is to just setup the second monitor to mirror the first then run your visualization fullscreen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">problem: you can't edit/switch presets then :(<br />
      that is probably what casper2k wants to do</p>
