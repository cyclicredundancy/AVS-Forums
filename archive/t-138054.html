      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS &amp; cd wont work right</strong><br />
      :cry: Ok, I poured through the forum subjects on the subject, THOUGHT i had found the solution several times, and several times i was dissappointed. My AVS is working excellent when i play a file from my hard drive, but if i choose a cd the AVS runs but it acts like no music is playing, please someone help?! i dont want to go to jail for avs-slaughter!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Best way would be to convert the cd music into mp3 and play, because running cd's in winamp3 along with AVS isnt such a nice way afterall.</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol I was searching for the same answer as at a friends PC and the CD would not play. Sort of guessed it would be that tick box but why on earth is this not enable from a fresh install I will never know.</p>
