			<strong>Need an unpublished preset</strong><br />
		
		

		Hello, well let me explain.<br />
1st of all i apologise 4 my english.<br />
2nd i know i'm a complete idiot and very lazy, so don't tell me.<br />
3rd i'm looking 4 help, so if you cant give it to me then don't say anything. <br />
Thanks.<br />
History:<br />
 Long time ago (like 2 or 5 years ago) i submited an AVS Preset Pack named 'jero_preset_pack_V2'. well the thing is that when i published that one (and the first one (v1)) i got my pc formatted and lost all my data.<br />
I never download the pack cuz i'm lazy but i really want it. some time ago i get an email from Winamp saying that &quot;Your component 'jero_preset_pack_V2' is now unpublished.&quot;<br />
Soooooooooooooooooooooo.... i have no way to obtain it.<br />
hehehe. so here i am, whining. <br />
do someone has the 1st or 2nd version? or both? i really want it, if someone could please send it to my email i'll be completly thankfull.<br />
Ok, thanks 4 listening good bye, winamp rocks, micro sucks, mac is the best and linux is awesome.  ^_^ i like anime and jmusic. c u all<br />

		i dont have any of those packs. btw, the title was so confusing i thought you may want us to do a preset for you. title it next time to something like &quot;does someone have my pack?&quot; or something like this.

		a lot of the old removed plugins, etc are still in the submission database so copies of them can be acquired if needed (though i think there's still a number of ones completely lost now due to time)<br />
