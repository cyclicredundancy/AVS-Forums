<div class="posttext">I hope you're joking, Horsefly, because otherwise you'd be wasting all your time telling people to try and get UnConeD, who is infinitely smarter than you'll ever be, and savior to all of us (speaking of which, you don't seem smart enough to operate Winamp, let alone AVS - another reason for you to go away), banned - only for wasting maybe half a minute of your time with a small April Fools joke.<br />
<br />
And if I may paraphrase you....<br />
People, people, look what we have become...we are talking about Trillian instead of Horse-Fly being an idiot for keeping this thread at the top of the forum by complaining about it.<br />

I wasn't joking! Lets ban UnConeD. <br />
I also heard somewhere that he was a Neo-Nazi too so he should be banned again for that.;)<br />

I know there is a forum thread for this, but i do have avs/winamp skills...  <br />

Now lets ban unconed. Give him zero stars on his whacko avs (please don't... it is really good though) (Nuts... i can't believe i said that).<br />

UnConeD is just a step ahead =)<br />

Hate + Chaos + A person for catalyst = destruction.<br />
Who's the catalyst? I bet that's no question.<br />

EDIT : Oh yeah,and I know Atero is not UnConeD - Go to www.acko.net (UnConeD's website... I got the link right right?) - in the forums, one of Atero's posts should prove it...<br />

(No, I'm not defending UnConeD - We're risking some of the integrity of the AVS community...)</div></div><hr />

Oh by the way Rovastar, I have full control over my forum... who says I wouldn't 'pull a schizo' and write up a whole fake thread? After all, I am a crazy neo-nazi virus-writer in disguise (http://www.winamp.com/skins/reviews.jhtml?rOT=C&amp;rOI=100943) :D :p !<br />
Seriously, I'm not Atero :).<br />
<br />
Let's all shake hands and make up. Besides drunken monkeys and chat clients have nothing to do with AVS, right? :)<br />
<br />
Though... drunken monkeys remind me of those annoying 'punch the monkey' ads that TreeLoot (http://www.treeloot.com/) runs. Probably because of yesterdays UserFriendly (http://www.userfriendly.org) comic.</div></div><hr />

People here are always having a go at each other. Nic01 still seems to think Rovastar hates AVS, and that he is serious about banning UnConeD. Surely you know it's only a joke by now? Yet you think that something's &quot;threatening the AVS community&quot;. Chill out.. it's all cool :up: No-one's having a real dig at anyone.. 'tis all in good fun.<br />
<br />
Lighten up guys! Don't take everything seriously... it's supposed to be entertaining as well as informative here.<br />
<br />
Now, back to my research on the potential links that UnConeD has with neo-Nazism ;)  [BTW, The ;) means I am NOT SERIOUS! So make sure you know this is a joke!]</div></div><hr />
