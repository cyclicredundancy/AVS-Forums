You think you'll get praised for this?? Its a clear rip from from El-vis's Counting Beats preset! If you take someone else's work atleast credit them! I just get pissed off when someone rips el-vis's work:mad: apoligise now!:mad:

		Look, normally i'm very cool, but this is going way out of control we've had so many rippers in the last 30 or so days that i'm so frustated. If this is a remake you should know its a remake of who's preset and credit him. <br />
And , sorry for what i said before , just forget it. I was really in a bad mood that time, but now i'm fine.

		Newpicks suck anyways.  They all look they same, theres quite a few with bad FPS, and they don't do much, just kinda sit there.  <br />
<br />
btw - Yellow/Gray is a really bad color combination (in my opinion). <br />
<br />
A preset has a creator.  A creator makes the code.  <b>You</b> are the creator.  <b>You</b> make the code.
