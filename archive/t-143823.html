      <p class="post-content">I know it isn't much of an issue, but you could speed it up by making n=w instead of 800 in the superscope.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, noobish like you said, but better than your last one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">He could've just not put it up here and be redicule and all... Oh well, I guess thats what new members do for fun when they aren't on another site. Well here is my remix... I don't know how it would look to anyone else though, but I just think this better than his though. Hope you hate or like it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well the dot grid is kind of grainy and kind of ugly...there's better methods of giving it color. if you really want a monochrome background then you should try a dynamic clear screen:<br />
      superscope (init: n=0; point: x=0;y=0;) &lt;- color this<br />
      movement (d=0)<br />
      to add it as a background you should put the rest of it in an effect list and use it as a render:<br />
      effect list (ignore, buffer 1 blend (might need to be inverted))<br />
      .preset...<br />
      .buffer 1 save (replace)<br />
      and then you should put the invert at the end so it doesn't go crazy.<br />
      <br />
      hope that helped...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks awesome to me. I can't help you on how to make it move to the beat though. I have a AVS you can take a look at. If you want to look at it, here is the link to it. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/anime3/finalfantasygallore/Mysterious_Beat_Beauty.avs" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/anime3/fina...eat_Beauty.avs</a> . I hope it will help you out, but at least give credit upon using one of the things on it, alright?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is my remix of it. I don't know if it is what you are looking for or if you want a remix or not... I just added it to some Effect Lists to cause it to beat to the music, etc. I also added some other things too. I hope you like Jerko.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you. Im thinking of doing a "love" AVS im still thinking, So if i make half a heart and then mirror it and then i thought well once i want it to be waveform scope it wouldnt work because the way mirror works or am i just high on something and its unachievable? and for the half would i have to use diffrent scopes for the bends?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It might work, I don't know. I am home now and I won't be able to see your work right now. I have to ask my older brother if I can download Winamp. I might not though and just download RealOne Player instead. I am not sure yet. I think it probably does look real good Jerko. Also thank you for giving me credit upon the remix, I appreciate it Jerko.</p>
