		I will be sending my new pack off to be reviewed in a few days so I desided to release a couple more visuals from it. Upon release, the pack will contain 50 presets and a couple of bonus remixes. I would greatly appreciate some comments on the preview. Thanks guys.

		These are all spectacular!<br />
<br />
Whoa there Solamon...<br />
<br />
(drum rolls.......)  This 3 pack preset gains a 5 Stars out of 5 Stars!<br />
<br />
Awesome!<br />
<br />
My fave was the staircase one.  It definitely looks like a staircase.<br />
Beautiful was the orbitron project one as well.

		Great presets, not spectacular, but they are great.<br />
Oh, yeah, I just downloaded the 1st preview of the pack, those presets are cool too. <br />
<br />
PS, you're not the first one to discover/use that DynShift/RB combo, I found it 5 months ago (check out the preset Pistaccio in my 3rd pack).<br />
<br />
PPS. Are you a MTG player, that Ornithopter thing is awfully familiar :D.

		Dog: I used to play MTG a couple of years ago, but the inspiration for that preset doesn't come from the ornithopter card. I designed it based on an old electronica tape I picked up a long time ago when I used to go to raves. The tape is called &quot;Flight of the Ornithopter&quot; and it is among the most amazing trance music I have ever discovered. <br />
<br />
About the how dynshft/roto combo, I didn't figure I was the first to discover it because it's a pretty basic technique, but I do figure I'm the first to notice that when the effect list is configured right and you put a bump behind it you get a fire coming out of the floor look. Of course I don't know that for sure either. I realy liked the way you used the technique, but I think our aproach is entirely different. Eitherway, your third pack was really great and I posted up a 4 star review for you. I would have liked to give it four and a half, but you know we can't do that. It would be nice next time if you pack was a little bit longer though.<br />
<br />
Montana: I really liked dancing knot too! :) I discovered it when I was trying to remix another preset I made. And I kind of stumbled upon the technique. Gotta love it when that happens. <br />
<br />
As for Lady Anubuk, her pack is almost done. She is putting the finishing touches on the colors and desiding the final names for all the presets. In about a week it should be sent off to WinAmp for review. I'll pass the word on that people would like another preview of the pack before it gets posted.
