      and I am really frightened by the prospect! I know that I suck at AVSing, please remember this is my very first try and the coding is probably 50% unessecary... oh well, enough whining, I guess everyone has to let me have it sooner or later:eek:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i don't know what in the world i ever did to gave you confidence to make AVS presets, but I guess it's allright :)<br />
      <br />
      Fairly nice preset otherwise, but most of the AVS regulars have probably seen enough of flower-kaleidoscope type of presets already so don't be surprised if you get negative feedback on in it.<br />
      <br />
      Don't be discouraged though, if AVS is what you want to do (for a hobby) you will eventually learn all the tricks necessary to produce great presets. The begining looks promising enough though :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, Tugg. You probably don't remember but in another thread you and PAK made me realize that presets don't take math genius to do, thats all you did to inspire me. Isn't that enough? Otherwise I would have sat in ignorance forever, never even trying. As far as the flower scope is concerned, I know it's old hat, but I had to start somewhere. The next one I'm working on is more of a "boxy" deal. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Now that your actually making presets and getting into the swing of it I'll tell you the real truth... maths is EVERYTHING in AVS, you cant do ANYTHING without it, or all your presets will be SHIT! BWAHAHAHAH!<br />

      <p class="post-content">ha ha. You couldn't possibly crush my hopes now, PAK. (I know you're being sarcastic). As a matter of fact, the preset that I like best so far has almost no coding in it at all! That coding guide you wrote rules! I wish I would have known about it before.</p>

      <p class="post-content">using much code or not is mostly just a matter of taste. As you said there are great presets that use a minimum amount of code. On the opposite you'll find presets that are full of tough and incomprehensible code but look not that good. In my opinion it's not coding-qualilites that makes a good avs-artist, but it's all about style. Just go on making more presets. While you're going to become noticeable better you will also get more and more coding skills.</p>

      <p class="post-content">goodness knows...<br />
      but as you might know most artists have got an account on deviantart.com. So they can present their stuff there and many of them come to this forum rather seldom (which doesn't mean any offense!).<br />
      Perhaps the whole thing has something to do with the further development of avs (= most probably there won't be a new version ever).<br />
      <br />
      However i'd rather like to know if we can do something against that decay. But probably the great AVS-times just are past now...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Crap. I wish I had had the gumption to start AVSing sooner. Ah, well. That would be great if everyone at deviant art could develop it and perhaps get a better version out. But do you really think that Nullsoft will just "retire" soon? I mean I know they say winamp has reached it's pinnacle, (And I can't imagine it being much better) but will this just turn into a site for people to ask questions about and submit skins and plug-ins to an archaic program?</p>

      <p class="post-content">that's what i wanted to explain, you will find more good/awesome packs there than here)<br />
      <br />
      well, avs can always become better. that's because you have the opportunity to make new APE's. Milkdrop for example hasn't got this "ape" principle. This developement idea provides avs a longer life-time than other visualisations i think. Many problems can be solved with a new ape. But we will surely come to a point when no new ape's can bring us any further. I hope this point comes in farther future but you cannot be sure. It surely is a pitty that avs wont be developed any further. But untill we reach that point, when no new developed ape can help at a specific problem i hope that avs becomes kind of "open source" so that the cracks can develop avs itself further. It might be only my wish, but i hope that this forum keeps alive not only to provide help to newbies like you. But also providing a community (causev that's one of the points why im posting here: there are other avs-interested people that also want to share their thoughts concerning avs)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, no problem. I've seen worse english from people who aren't drunk. It is really good to know that you and PAK and some of the other AVS masters will still be here for a while. And I forgot about APEs, it seems like there is still a pretty good well of creativity to be had there. Of course, I am no programmer, so I can't really say how much more there may be to go (There are probably still several APEs that I have never even heard of). Btw, does deviant art or someone have a comprehensive list of all the existing APEs?</p>

      Actually i don't know if there's a such a ape-list, but i'm wondering why you should need one. When you dl more packs, your amount of apes will automatically increase. (so it was in my case)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, of course I count you among those avs masters. As for the APEs I don't NEED a list per se, but I just thought it might be handy to have one. I get more whenever I dl a pack that has one, but how will I know when I have them all? I assume the number of apes is finite, lol.<br />
      <br />
      Actually I have discovered a bunch of apes and presets in my windows system folder. How the hell they got there I'll never know, but now I have a bunch of stuff that isn't labled with the author's name. (Like I make sure to label them as soon as I get them). So soon I will either post them up here to see if you or anyone knows who made them, or I'll just put them in a folder labled 'unknown'. Probably the latter.</p>

      <p class="post-content">perhaps it's a bit exaggerated to call me an avs master i didn't even publish my first pack...<br />
      However.. bout those presets: normally the well known artists name their presets so that they are recognizable. So probably those unnmaed presets you have were made by rather unknown artists, so it would be pure accident if someone could assign them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, maybe a little exaggerated...although I saw the presets from you that are available, and it's nice work. That texer cube in paticular; I'm not sure if you ever did anything with it, but it's very innovative. :)<br />
      <br />
      I see what you mean about the 'phantom' presets. I'm sure they aren't from anybody really well known. Oh well, it's always good to have an 'unknown' folder somewhere (Don't ask me why). I haven't even gone through them yet but I have stumbled across some of them from time to time, and I know some of them are quite good.</p>

      btw i also have a folder for all single or unknown presets.. it provides some more order for my avs folders. ;)</p>
