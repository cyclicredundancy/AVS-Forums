<div class="posttext">Ok, This pluggin stuff is just too time consuming and but I do have a real need for some specific applications so I'm looking to hire someone to create something for me. I'm not made of money so be gentle ok. However, The idea I have has a real marketable use and I plan on making it so if it proves to be viable. <br />
<br />
If in fat the concept is marketable then part royalties would be paid to the coder.<br />
<br />
No games please. You need to know what you are doing and willing to enter into a non disclosure agreement.<br />
<br />
A watered down version of the plugin would be given to winamp for peeps to be creative with.<br />

<div class="posttext">Mind you avs is a open source community project and are not swayed by money to much. we program and make avs better for fun not profit. donations are welcome but thats about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you know.<br />
If you have the time to look for someone and then suddenly state in the request that the person who &quot;wrote&quot;<br />
the plugin will only get some of the royalties then you have just lost a deal.<br />
<br />
The person that makes the software is one who gets the money from the royalties not you. you get the profit from the software being sold. now shall we try asking nicely again.<br />
<br />
I'm not a programmer anymore but i do take offense when someone trys to rip off others.<br />
Also this not meant to offensive.<br />
i'm just stating my views.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you better speak for yourself.. i wouldn't mind make some bucks with this rather pointless matter. i just don't think the original poster is looking for avs presets, but a real plugin.<br />
<br />
zaphon: as avs has not the qualification to fit any professional requirement, i recommend asking around on other websites.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You summed it up nicely Yathosho but unfortunately what I need  is a real plugin isolated to winamp unless someone can point me in another direction in which milkdrop can be run. As far as making money if I am putting in $$ and reaching out to my resources to finance something ambitious then I think it would be a typical business arrangement not unlike a contractor arrangement. When someone contracts me to design a product it isn't uncommon for me to accept royalties which can be more to my advantage. Licenses are another common and lucrative arrangement.<br />
<br />
Now!  If someone is serious about coding a real and robust plugin then I would really like to get on with business ASAP</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Zaphon, people are unlikely to take your request seriously unless you provide some details about your business, a loose specification of what you require and some private contact details.<br />
<br />
You should also keep in mind that the majority of avs artists on these boards are not programmers.</div></div><hr />
