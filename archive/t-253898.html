<div class="posttext">I have finished my work on Rockets game - Stage 2 project.<br />
Here is the pre-release of it in two archives.<br />
Total zip size:~130 kb<br />
Zip 1: preset, required GVM model, some atworks<br />
Zip 2: another required atwork<br />
Includes Keyboard function based on Grandchild's Text SSC, Keyboard is also linked with and used in Assistance (hint) mode. <br />
<br />
Any feedbacks on the project are highly apperciated.<br />
Please report if the patch was broken, and also if any other inconveniences or mistakes in preset are present.<br />
<br />
EDIT: After further test, I've found 3 problems:<br />
If mission is complete, the stone position isn't reset after end of game (pershaps this appeared after the last edits, I didn't experience this earlier)<br />
Inaccurate code of health meter (sometimes showing health&lt;0)<br />
Mistakes and inaccuracies in armor counter part of shot texer-II's, which make flying direction of last shot change after it is left when armor=0)<br />
I post a new file now<br />
<br />
EDIT2: Changed text line &quot;Text by Grandchild&quot; by <br />
&quot;Text SSC by Grandchild&quot;, which is more correct.<br />
I post a new file now</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">On looking foward to seeing this preset as i said in the last post. I am greatly impressed by the complexity and great coding that was used to make this preset. i give you a 100 over 10. heh anyway i do have some suggestions. try to make your collision program a bit more sensitive. also according to your instructions i was supposed to kill the monster that was shooting right well he was not shooting and i was able to clear the game without killing him. you might want to look into that. any way great work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Earthquaker i was impressed with the first. but now i'm losing interest. also i found a glitch. your firing code for alt-left,up,down,right is failing to work. but anyway good job thou alot of work has gone into this that much i can see. you know with your skills you should try making a tetris game like UnConeD did. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I had discovered a glitch with shooting code in Rockets stage 2. There, when you were shooting and had reset the game, you fail to shoot so many times as there were shots rendered before game reset.<br />
And there was other glitch, where the shot passes through the moving (mission) wall.<br />
Those glitches were tested to be fixed in stage 3. I will test for them further; The only case when shooting does not work is perhaps when armor counter shows &quot;zero&quot;.</div></div><hr />
