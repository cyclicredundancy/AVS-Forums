		Okay...Here's the story:<br />
I was working on this preset (Fistfight) for about an hour last night, getting everything nice 'n perfect, and while checking it, I switched from docked to windowed mode.  Winamp crashed.  Note that I was not editing code or adding any components or refreshing an editor window or anything like that - I was switching window sizes.  This shouldn't cause any anomolies in the actual calculations (since I don't have any size-change triggered events).  I reopened it, and it was on another one of my presets - the preview from TFF2.0, if anyone's interested - and Winamp crashed again.  Assuming it was a problem with AVS and not my presets, I restarted.  The preview from TFF2.0 works now, but Fistfight still didn't.  I checked for too many variables and/or division by zero - there was none.  I tried deleting vis_avs.dat, it didn't work.  Can someone please tell me what's going on - if there's a problem with the preset (and if so, what), or if it's just my system?

		It crashed on my computer too.  Said something about colormap.  To tell you the truth, I don't know why it is crashing.

		Works fine for me. The only asumption I can make is that there is some resolution bug in the colormap.<br />
Btw. its a very nice preset.

		how can you tell?  were you able to get it running?<br />
i really want to figure out how i can get it running, at least temporarily, so i can fix the problem; right now AVS crashes when I load it.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; This is really starting to piss me off: I moved colormap.ape out of the AVS directory (so it wouldn't load), and the preset worked fine.  I proceded to delete the Colormap entry, and it continued to work just fine.  However, when I remade the Colormap, it worked fine while i was watching it - but once I tried to restart it, it crashed!  Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this??? &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;edit2&gt; The saga continues.  I was just able to load the preset without a problem, and reset it, and change window sizes, and everything.  Even under different songs.  Ay'm sho kunfyuszhedd.... &lt;/edit2&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;edit3&gt; Well, it crashed again, but this time I was editing the superscope.  I guess I'm not gonna do that anymore. &lt;/edit3&gt;

		Atero, my preset &quot;White Frame&quot; originally had a colormap, but it crashed every time i tried to open it. While i was editing it it worked fine and the colormap would work fine, but save it and re open it and it would crash. Renaming the colormap, taking away the &quot;unknown render&quot; away while at it seemed to be the only way to remove the colormap and make the preset work again.<br />
<br />
I don't know the solution, but the problem seems to be the colormap. Just don't use it :p

		yes, well, the problem is: colormap rox.  and i wouldn't want to have to bug unconed into debugging it, since he's pretty much dropped AVS entirely (as far as I can tell) and has moved on.<br />
(read: i want to find an easy solution that will let me be confident in the fact that i can release this preset (which, if you haven't noticed, kicks ass) without people bitching at me cos it freezes.)

		Ahh, okay, I thought you'd deserted us ;) (hadn't seen you 'round for quite a while - well, a few days, but still!)<br />
<br />
Didn't work any better - I think that's the version I had before :(
