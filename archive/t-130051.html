      <p class="post-content">Here are my comments. I would do them on DA, but it is really slow.<br />
      <br />
      <b>FF6 Intro(composed by Degnic)</b> - Terrific background, but the F's aren't anything special, and neither is the text.<br />
      <b>Degnic-Bubble Gum</b> - I think I've already seen this. It's a nice flowy preset, but it's similar to many flowy presets.<br />
      <b>Fractal</b> - Nice fractal and shading in the background, but the fractal doesn't move too dynamically(try speeding it up and morphing it).<br />
      <b>Degnic Addicated</b> - Love the colors and the flow, but I don't like the Roto Blitter or the oscilliscope dot SSC.<br />
      <b>Oussy 01</b> - Interesting look, but I would like some vertical movement and rotation in the DM.<br />
      <b>Oussy 03</b> - Horrendous colors, and the movement is kinda overused, but it does result in a nice glowing plasma-like look.<br />
      <b>Oussy 04</b> - Nothing great with the movement or the texture(MP's). It could be nice if you added some movement and rotation and turned it into a unique plane preset.<br />
      <b>Oussy 05</b> - Somewhat interesting texture, but the movement kinda kills it. It's a simple wall movement.<br />
      <b>Oussy 06</b> - Nice water movement, but the edges of the tiles are obvious and the texture isn't terrific, but it's alright.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi Magma Warp</b> - Rotation is too constant appearing, but the colors are great.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi Microscopic View</b> - I would like it if the lens moved more. I love the buffer effect in this one.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi New Wave Whirlpool</b> - Love the colors and the slowly morphing movement. Great preset.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi Smoothies</b> - Interesting preset. The smoothies could use some more subtle color change, but it is nice. Don't like the pink though.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi SOME WAVES!</b> - Love the 2 layer effect, and the colors and movement are great.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi Spin Spin Galaxy</b> - Still think that the chaotically moving dots are weird, but it is a nice preset.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi Swirl Warp</b> - The movement is very weird, but I like it.<br />
      <b>Tuggummi The Ultimate TTC Battle</b> - Love this preset. It really looks awesome, and reminds me of paranoya with some awesome colors and movements thrown on top.<br />
      <b>Zxe A Firy Carnage</b> - Interesting preset, but the background should be slightly dynamic and the SSC's should react a bit more to the music.<br />
      <b>Zxe Rosedeparis</b> - Don't like the pink color, but the movement is alright. Try making it 3D.<br />
      <b>Zxe Spaceship</b> - Background is great, but the spaceship looks like it's on the same plane as the stars and is flat.<br />
      <b>Zxe Subular Flow</b> - Don't like the vertical line, and there isn't anything spectacular in this preset.<br />
      <b>Zxe Too Many Mushrooms Sky Looks Weird</b> - Like the colors, but I've seen the overlayed effect before. The background is great.<br />
      <font color="red">Overall:4.25</font>. Lovely presets from all of you. Can't wait til FF7 comes out.</p>

      </blockquote>It might be that FF6 was our last pack. There are not so many members anymore and since I'm quitting there is even one less. I just hope that some old members who didn't take part in this pack decides to join again and FF7 would come out eventually.....

      <p class="post-content">Finnish Flash 6 review<br />
      <br />
      Well the pack is out after some time but better late then never.Lets see what it offers :)<br />
      <br />
      Degnic - Intro - Looks good, i like the idea with texered superscope in the background.Oh and shouldnt the other F be colored too ? A small bug with the text appears after an artist`s name fades out...<br />
      Otherwise its pretty original. 4.4/5<br />
      Degnic - Bubblegum - seen in Desibel v.6 and did a remix :) Its pretty cute,the water effect works great.I dont think you can make this preset better, so i`ll give it a 4.5/5<br />
      Degnic - Fractal - also in Desibel v.6 but this version looks better.Its a bit tooooo dark , add a fast brightness and it will look even better IMO. 4.3/5<br />
      Degnic - Addictated(isnt it Addictive or Addicted ?) - now this is GREAT ! I just love presets with a cartoon look! Could be a little more dynamic,a dyna shift works just great. 5/5<br />
      <br />
      Oussy - 1 - new AVSer with some style i can see.Nothing too great in this preset but the overall glow is pretty cool. 3.6/5<br />
      Oussy - 3(where is 2?) - nice DM,looks like the renders are chewed hehe.The grainy effect aint so nice but the preset is kinda cute. 3.8/5<br />
      Oussy - 4 - another dancing DM :) The texture is OK but these presets need some diversity... 3.5/5<br />
      Oussy - 5 - Hah, circuits ! This one is better,the DM could be better and a little more beat responsive.Good preset. 4/5<br />
      Oussy - 6 - Wavey movement...At least the texture looks better but the preset is too blurred.Disable the blend from the last DM. 3.7/5<br />
      <br />
      Tuggummi - Magma Warp - Looks great ! Adding more scopes gets a even more nicer effect. Like Addictated a dynamic shift fits here.4.2/5<br />
      Tuggummi - Microscope View - MUUUCH better then the first version.The lens that magnifies the background is MEGACOOL ! Love this one,its just perfect. 5/5<br />
      Tuggummi - New Wave Whirlpool - Magma Warp with some blue some fog and a little slow.This aint so great but it sure goes to the eye candy category. 4/5<br />
      Tuggummi - Smoothies - pretty cool idea but...but...what the hell is it ??? 4/5<br />
      Tuggummi - Some Waves - Ok this is just MESMERISING PERFECT GREAT OK SUPER COOL MARVELOUS ! One of the best presets i`ve ever seen ! Full 5 stars.<br />
      Tuggummi - Spin Spin Galaxy - another eye candy preset.The starfield is great but the galaxy looks..umm...a bit ugly IMO. 4.6/5<br />
      Tuggummi - Swirl Warp - looks like a molehole...Anyway this is yet another Ã¼ber preset from Tugg and its great like most of his presets. 4.8/5<br />
      Tuggummi - The Ultimate TTC battle - dammit ! Great preset but its a bit too dark.IMO these kind of presets should be bright,but not too bright.I hope you understand... 4.8/5<br />
      <br />
      Zxe - A Firy Carnage (Gathering Energy remix) - Woohoo ! 3D in the pack ! Pretty cool idea but the preset looks ugly...Has a grainy effect and that yellow sucks. 3.9/5<br />
      Zxe - Rosedeparis - Sometimes looks good sometimes has a pixeled effect.Could use some improvement otherwise it is sweet. 4.2/5<br />
      Zxe - Spaceship v.2 - Uh...Race! Its a bit too fast and the space often goes out of the screen.Better osc coding is welcomed. 3.9/5<br />
      Zxe - Subular Flow - I dont like this one too much,the grain effect is too much and i hate the movement... 3.5/5<br />
      Zxe - Too Many Mushrooms(Sky Looks Weird) - Well this one has the grain effect too but it goes OK here.Has a Picasso look kinda. 4/5<br />
      <br />
      Overall rating -&gt; 4.2/5 :) Good job,too bad JDm and spherehead werent able to finish the presets in time. Oh and Degnic : DO NOT LEAVE THE AVS SCENE ! Everyone does it because of school and stuff.Dont you have 1 hour/day in which you can do a preset ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It would be a shame if you Finns would stop Finnish Flash. Group projects are always awesome. &amp; FF was high-quality. If version 6 is any sign, you guys are in top shape &amp; should keep with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well it's still Zxe, Oussy &amp; Me (JDm, seems to lost all intress in avs, though he hasn't said anything about quitting) We will see the future of FF... well in the future :) I don't think we will be planning a new pack in the next couple of months, but it would be a shame if it would stop at 6 packs :(</p>
