<div class="posttext">I have a damn big problem. And that problem is you! What the fuck is happening with the enthusiasm and lots of talking on the forums? This place is getting duller and duller. Is it just me, or what? Damn! I used to be happy around here. Now it's just nice, but enthusiasm? no :(. Am I the only one who feels this way? Nobody seems to really like other peoples work anymore. Somebody posts a new preset, and generally gains 3 or 4 replies now, instead of the about 20 which it used to be. And that's just one thing...<br />
<br />
Damn :cry:<br />
<br />
me feels sad<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
Yay! I just got Major Dude, I love it :). Now you all come back and have fun here again!<br />
&lt;/edit&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The first step to having fun is to get off that temper.<br />
It's still as fun as ever, you're just grumpier than ever from what I saw...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hm... is that it.. Okay I'll try :)<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
And yes, it's true. I'm feeling a bit depressed lately, don't ask me why, I dunno it myself. I hope I'll get over it soon. Sorry if I pissed someone off who doesn't deserve it...<br />
&lt;/edit&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree with you Deamon, you are partially right. These AVS fourms are pretty boring lately. I don't know whether it is the fact that a bunch of people just don't have the time for AVS because of school, like me, or maybe it's just that we don't have the same varied amount of people. Hopefully the future looks brighter though with Winamp5 and the new AVS version, if Nullsoft doesn't mess it it up, we should have a worldclass app and a whole new reappearnce of talent and interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2003, 19:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree with that :) Though the forums can't improve without improving yourselves first, so that's what I'm gonna do :). You know what truly sucked for me the last time? When I posted my new preset (planet X molecules), and only one person replied to it after a week. Gives you the feeling your not appreciated etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I am currently busy with the rest of my life.  I am still doing my duties as an AVS reviewer and such, but I haven't been posting nearly as much in these forums these last few days - I have people and things in my life far more important than posting 20ppd in these forums.  I still go through and read a lot, but I don't post nearly as much.<br />
<br />
A lot of posts isn't always a better thing - a lot of times people end up just repeating what others have said, which doesn't really do much(hence my recent overuse of &quot;me agrees to...&quot; followed by an extension on their thoughts to further specify my thoughts on the matter).  If I don't have anything unique to add, then I don't make the post.<br />
<br />
As far as interest in others presets go, I still love AVS just as much as always and still like giving others feedback when I have the time(and it takes a lot of time for me - I try to go in depth with my reviews).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think that avs is pretty much just wearing out.  as sad as it may seem, i think that the interest is going down because nobody's doing anything anymore, since everything's gotten so boring.  i'm also pretty sure that the updates won't fix much of that.  but i might be wrong...what with the release of wa5 a lot of people might &quot;discover&quot; avs, and if it's majorly cool, and if it keeps getting updates, we might live again...but i find that rather unlikely.  not that i don't want justin to keep updating...;)</div></div><hr />

Wait for a month or two, there'll be something that might rejuvenate the community...<br />
<br />
Juuuuust wait.<br />
<br />
(Or 3 months... or 4 months... I think you know who you are.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are you refering to some great event that you have knowladge of that we do not? Maybe if it is that you would like to let us in on this little secret? Hmmmm?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well.  i've heard a lot of chitchat in #ff lately between nic and unconed about various &quot;really 1337 presets&quot; (and those :mad: ASSHOLES :mad: have left me pretty much out of the loop)...don't think it requires much explanation :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Deamon, well i used to comment a lot before the summer, but nowadays im feeling a bit lazy, because i will always have to install wa and download a few songs before i can view avs while online, so i have been lazy to do that.<br />
<br />
Why i have to install them everytime? Because the main source for internet for me is my school, i don't have any kind of connection at home :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think we might get a new version of WhackoAVS in the near future...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">New Whacko? That would be so cool. I'd plainly love it. You know, after posting this, I instantly felt better :) So the problem partially was me for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Really no need to complain the scene here is healthy and like anything has it's up and downs it comes in waves of interest it seems.<br />
<br />
The is little doubt that when WA5 is released there will be a flood of people to this board. The number browsing the forums will tripel or so and some will come here. New people will join in the AVS game and old faces will come back again with a new AVS coming out.</div></div><hr />
