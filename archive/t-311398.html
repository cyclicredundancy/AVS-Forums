      <p class="post-content">Its pretty damn hard to recognize the preset(or the author) from the screenshot alone. Looks pretty old school to me.<br />
      Maybe the visbot archives has it in there somewhere (it'll be some job finding it though!!) :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">good luck finding that one. i'd probably start with <a href="http://avsociety.deviantart.com/art/AVSociety-Anthology-756896" target="_blank">AVSociety Anthology</a> and otherwise try the individual packs from the included artists. if you're still unlucky by then and nobody else knows this - you might as well give up!</p>

      <p class="post-content">It might have been in some commuity pack. I don't know?<br />
      <br />
      I think it came with one of the packs you get with the winamp download.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a list of the differnt packs that come with the differnt ver. of winamp. I think it came with one of ver 5<br />
      <br />
      Long story short. vista crashed. I'm still trying to recover.<br />
      <br />

      Thanks for your help Yathosho and [Ishan]! :D<br />
      <br />
      I did'nt realise how many presets there are. I got pile of them now. :D<br />
      <br />
      Well I went through hundreds of them to find the right ones for my project. Then I lost it.<br />
      <br />
      Back on track and back to work. Look for my project featuring AVS artists soon on this fourm.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright now we are getting somewere. Obvious I came to the right place.;)<br />
      <br />
      Well what I'm trying to do is get the AVS recorded in<br />
      1280 x 720 Full HD Quality For use in my videos.<br />
      <br />
      I tried avsgabber....... it worked a couple of times.<br />
      Then I tried HyperCam 2 and that locks up and crashes.<br />
      The video was clear but the avs was not smooth. Something to do with the frame rates.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe my computer not up to the task. I'm using a Vista Duo Core 2.0 GHz 4 GB (RAM)<br />
      <br />
      Any tips or tricks? Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">avsgrabber most of the time crashes for me, so since i got a new computer i'm using camtasia to grab all the vids you see on <a href="http://visbot%20tv" target="_blank">visbot tv</a>. i grab them without sound and i try not to set the resolution too high. the video will still be slower than the preset alone, but it's not too bad.</p>

      Why was i quoted? :p i aint the one searching for ugly ancient presets... :D<br />
      <br />
      Personal opinion : why capture a 8yr old (IMO ugly and basic) preset in HD when you're got great eye candy available in more recent presets?<br />
      <br />
      but then again.. its your choice and your use. :D</p>
