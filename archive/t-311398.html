<div class="posttext">Its pretty damn hard to recognize the preset(or the author) from the screenshot alone. Looks pretty old school to me.<br />
Maybe the visbot archives has it in there somewhere (it'll be some job finding it though!!) :p<br />

<div class="posttext">good luck finding that one. i'd probably start with AVSociety Anthology (http://avsociety.deviantart.com/art/AVSociety-Anthology-756896) and otherwise try the individual packs from the included artists. if you're still unlucky by then and nobody else knows this - you might as well give up!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It might have been in some commuity pack. I don't know?<br />
<br />
I think it came with one of the packs you get with the winamp download.<br />
<br />
Is there a list of the differnt packs that come with the differnt ver. of winamp. I think it came with one of ver 5 <br />
<br />
Long story short. vista crashed. I'm still trying to recover. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a video of it in action.<br />

Thanks for your help Yathosho and [Ishan]! :D <br />
<br />
I did'nt realise how many presets there are. I got pile of them now. :D <br />
<br />
Well I went through hundreds of them to find the right ones for my project. Then I lost it.<br />
<br />
Back on track and back to work. Look for my project featuring AVS artists soon on this fourm.<br />
<br />
Thanks again. ;)</div></div><hr />

it's amazing that people still want to watch those random (and ugly) presets from back then, while the real scene is widely ignored.<br />

<div class="posttext">Alright now we are getting somewere. Obvious I came to the right place.;) <br />
<br />
Well what I'm trying to do is get the AVS recorded in<br />
 1280 x 720 Full HD Quality For use in my videos. <br />
<br />
I tried avsgabber....... it worked a couple of times.<br />
Then I tried HyperCam 2 and that locks up and crashes.<br />
The video was clear but the avs was not smooth. Something to do with the frame rates. <br />
<br />
Maybe my computer not up to the task. I'm using a Vista Duo Core 2.0 GHz  4 GB (RAM)<br />
<br />
Any tips or tricks?  Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">avsgrabber most of the time crashes for me, so since i got a new computer i'm using camtasia to grab all the vids you see on visbot tv. i grab them without sound and i try not to set the resolution too high. the video will still be slower than the preset alone, but it's not too bad.</div></div><hr />

Why was i quoted? :p i aint the one searching for ugly ancient presets... :D<br />
<br />
Personal opinion : why capture a 8yr old (IMO ugly and basic) preset in HD when you're got great eye candy available in more recent presets?<br />
<br />
but then again.. its your choice and your use. :D</div></div><hr />
