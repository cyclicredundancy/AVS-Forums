<div class="posttext">Just a thought, but...<br />
<br />
You know how Windows has a &quot;Marquee&quot; screensaver that scrolls text across the screen? Well, Render&gt;Marquee would work kinda like that, only it would scroll the name of the song across the preset each time a new song in the Winamp playlist started.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you could select various color/shape effects, such as 3D Text, bordered text, the ability to have the color of the text shift (either dynamically in response to the music - such as having it be an inverted color zone in the preset, or static, the way a Ring or Simple cycles through colors), have sections of the playlist listing come on at a time (say, Artist, then Title or vice-versa) and perhaps have the text pause on-screen for a while so that people could read it.<br />
<br />
And naturally, ther would have to be an option for continuous scrolling of the information or one-time-only scrolling on track start.<br />
<br />
The configuration options for the Marquee might be as follows:<br />
<br />
Color: [color box here, disabled if Mode is Invert]<br />
<br />
Mode:<br />
( ) 3D<br />
( ) Invert (this would be the effect that would cause the text to be an inverted color zone on the preset itself)<br />
( ) Shadowed<br />
( ) Outlined<br />
( ) Plain<br />
<br />
[ ] Pause for X milliseconds<br />
    ( ) between sections<br />
    ( ) when all information is onscreen<br />
<br />
[ ] Separate Marquees for artist and title<br />
<br />
( ) Scroll once at track start<br />
( ) Scroll constantly</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">first of all, that is so n00bish, and second you can do all that with some render/texts , some scopes and a dm</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah you can do it with dm's easily, the only thing missing is that song title. A better idea would be to add the time/song title option to the text render /me thinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">One, I don't think you can selectively apply Invert so that it only affects a certain area of the presets is the inverse of the rest of the preset, like the Text object rendered in the marquee....I also don't think it's possible that text, scopes and a Dynamic Movement will create an inverted color zone for the words in the Text object either - the key to this being that the text, all the text, and NOTHING BUT THE TEXT is the inverse in color of the rest of the preset.<br />
<br />
Going to have to experiment to see if an inverted color zone forming the letters in the marquee with scopes, text and a DM is possible...<br />
<br />
Two, having cycling text colors a la the Oscilloscope Star, Rinng, Simple, or Superscope doesn't look possible. Again, I'm going to have to experiment and find out.<br />
<br />
But if these effects are possible with the methods described, it's definitely a good idea to add the detection of track name, artist name, and track length to the Text object.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">EF (ignore, subblend 1) &lt;-this could be subblend 2, i don't remember...<br />
.text<br />
.multiplier (inf. root)<br />
<br />
That'll invert the area of the text.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmm. Well, now that I have the Multiplier transform effect (thanks to teh I Wanna Be Frank Nagel AVS pack), I'll test that.<br />
<br />
Added:<br />
<br />
It does work...now to make it act like a marquee...<br />
