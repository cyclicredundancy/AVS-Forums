<div class="posttext">I know how to work the basic plugins. But what is this AVS stuff? Advanced Visualization Studio. Okay, I've downloaded some. They've installed to Winamp/plugins/avs but how I do acess such a thing? So confused.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You have to have AVS selected as your plugin. Press CTRL-K and select &quot;Advanced Visualization Studio&quot;. Start it up, then select the preset by right clicking the AVS window.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is question number 1 in the FAQ. So I assume you didn't read it.<br />
<br />
As the maintainer of the FAQ, I'd like to know why, because it's not the first time this has happened. There's no point in having a FAQ if people don't read it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I scrolled through the faq, but it seemed disorganized to me and I couldn't find what I was looking for. Also it seemed like there was more than one faq type place. It's always better and easier to just put up your question and have it be answered. IMHO</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Question #1a: What is AVS?<br />
Question #1b: I downloaded a bunch of AVS plug-ins/presets, but they don't show up in the Winamp plug-ins list!<br />
<br />
AVS is a visualisation plug-in that isn't limited to predefined effects: the user can combine the library of built-in effects in endless ways to create so-called presets. There are tons of presets available for download on the web, most of which are a lot better than the default presets (they're a bit outdated).<br />
To view these presets, start AVS like any other plug-in and right-click the display. You can then choose from all the presets installed.  <br />
<br />
Far too confusing....:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh. Easier for you, yes. Better, no. I think it's just a sign of lazyness and to be honest, it annoys me. Instead of looking for the answer yourself, you go asking others as if you have no clue at all. Sorry, but I visit a lot of forums, and if there's one thing people hate, that's newbies asking basic questions over and over again.<br />
If it's a large forum, please always assume it has a FAQ and look for it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what in the FAQ did you think was disorganised? Rovastar pasted the relevant section and I agree, it's very clear.<br />
How can it be improved? Try not to just give criticism, but also explain why you feel that way and how it can be avoided. That way, you're not just doing the complaining, but also the helping: this usually elicits a much friendly response from communities, because most, if not all work is done voluntary.</div></div><hr />
