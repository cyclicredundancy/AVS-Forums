<div class="posttext">Im such a nub I dont know how to write super scope code I got most of it but i dont want it to spin and what not i want it to be like a EKG thing. I here is what i have please help!!!<br />

<div class="posttext">Go to the avs forums in the future.<br />
<br />
OK...I assune you did not write any of this code.  If you didn't, you have to give explicit credit.  If you want an oscilloscope, then you just need to write this: x=i*2-1;y=v;<br />
<br />
You also messed too much with the code, because I don't see anything when copying it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">He probably ripped it from another thing then screwed around with the code.  When you say EKG I assume you mean an oscilloscope (like a sine wave or the basic built-in vis).  If that's what you want, what I said earlier will work.</div></div><hr />

When you say EKG I assume .... <br />
<br />
Never assume anything. EKG = Electrocardiogram. That heart monitor thing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Its called an EKG and not ECG because there is also an electrocephalogram, which is called an EEG, not using ECG is meant to avoid confusion, although since the cardiogram came first is is sometimes still refered to as an ECG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good sites to look at would be to just search the fourms, read the FAQ, look at the Atero's AVS primer and just try things on your own based on other people's work that is at your level (Don't go around looking at UnConed's work, or somebody like that, you will just get a headache and kick your computer out a window)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You were asking help regarding 3d code and then you dont use it ? :rolleyes: Anyway,remove the movement,it sucks.And try using(or tinker around) with your own code,almost everything in the preset is from other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Totally off topic, but I'm pretty sure EEG = electro-encephalo-gram (Greek: kephalos = head, en- = inside). The abbreviation is correct.<br />
The reason an electrocardiogram is spelled EKG is probably because in Greek, heart is kardia (Greek has no 'c', it's only through Latinization that it was introduced).<br />
<br />
(edit: removed greek because Winamp.com doesn't like it and I don't feel like putting down HTML encodings)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">...why havent you attached the presets in the previous post ? :confused:<br />
The presets ? Both are very n00bish,you can do better than that.The building blocks preset is something everyone did and the second one is too chaotic and that r=y movements does more harm than good.Look at my version,i tuned it up a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well either way you get some credit. :D Better some then none. Well Im out of ideas but Im brain storming and writing and drawing ideas and hoping i can put them into motion with the help of Phaze to edit the bugs and his thoughts on it.
