      <p class="post-content"><strong>Overlay not working</strong><br />
      I am having some trouble with the overlay. I set the desktop to color, but it just shows up black on my desktop.<br />
      I have re-installed the newest version of winamp a few times and installed my latest video card drivers, but still no luck.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Number one I would close everything that you have open.. then make sure you have the screensaver turned off..<br />
      <br />
      Next..restart winamp and try this again.. note that any images..will not be overlayed except for the color range of your desktop color..<br />
      <br />
      Next make sure you have something playing...<br />
      <br />
      Next check the in screen winamp visualizations to make sure the bars are moving and not almost flat-lined if so change mp3's<br />
      <br />
      Let me know..<br />
      <br />
      Also if you wanna trade out help.. I need help wit an issue with my broadcaster..all you ave to do is tune in and tell me a few details..<br />

      <p class="post-content">The latest Winamp versions (5.31 and 5.32) come with a broken version of AVS.<br />
      &gt; Get an updater <a href="http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/AVS%20Update.exe" target="_blank">[here]</a><br />
      <br />
      Overlay mode doesn't work with some kinds of videocards.<br />
      &gt; Did overlay mode work before, with earlier versions of winamp?<br />
      <br />
      Please inform us if the updater fixes your issue (if it worked before)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have never tried to get overlay mode to work till recently so i don't know if it worked before or not.<br />
      Installed the updates and still nothing.<br />
      I am guessing it is my video card. I have an ATI X1300.</p>
