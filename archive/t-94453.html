      <p class="post-content">No offence man, but this is quite ugly. :( The white SSC just ruined it. I've remixed it to calm it down a bit, but I'm not sure it's very redeemable. Sorry. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">actulally i was playing with the scope(i dont know the math and stuff)<br />
      i got that scope and thought hey that reminds me of chalk on a chalk bord from its years of service on the education front<br />
      i think your a little harsh but to tell you the thruth your rimix looked baderer(yes baderer not bederer) than mine</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>In my opinion</strong><br />
      If I <i><b>HAD</b></i> to pick it would be SSJ's.... BTW Undefined or Bob as I will call you since we have enough Un named people around here... Your remix really just makes it "Baderer" than his and makes his "bederer" than yours....<br />

      <p class="post-content">Mmm. I just wanted to calm down that manic SSC, 'cause it was hurting my eyes. The objective was never to make it better, just make it more ambient.<br />
      <br />
