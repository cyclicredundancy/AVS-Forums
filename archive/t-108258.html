      <p class="post-content">well, since macromedia has a well documented (active x?) interface, i once read that it should be easy to implement flash into any application. so i guess it should work for avs through an ape.<br />
      <br />
      btw: <a href="http://www.resolume.com" target="_blank">resolume</a> is a nice visualization software that supports flash files.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But why? why? why? and why?<br />
      If you add a animated flash into it, then avs becomes more and more of a screensaver thing rather than music visualizer.<br />
      And the whole concept just amuses me. I also guess it would slow down avs too much and besides, what good is it? is it cool to have a background made of flash and the have a oscilliscope in the front for music visualization? lol...<br />
      <br />
      Of course i don't know too much about the subject, but this is my opinion. Flash in avs? no sense at all.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually things like ActiveX are worthless in AVS. They're designed to shield you completely from what's going on inside. This makes it easy to display a flash movie in an application, but makes it impossible to do anything with it that it wasn't designed for (i.e. use it in AVS as image source).</p>
