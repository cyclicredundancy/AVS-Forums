		<i>Fully animated and reacting to the rythm and style of the music.<br />
VJ Network therefore uses computer generated animation algorithms, designed and programmed by our Winamp visualization artist Yordan &quot;Tonic&quot; Vulchev. After the event, you can also run your customly produced animated logo on your home or office PCs. VJ Network will hand you out a CD with your animated logo and with the software to play it on each PC (very nice when clients visit you). You simply provide us with a bitmap image of your logo.<br />

		gah...tonic is <u>not</u> the guy i'd like to promote AVS.  his presets in no way show AVS's true potential.  moving particles, shit superscopes, and seasick DMs are not the kind of things i'd like in my company logo, thankyouverymuch....

		Funny that they mention 'not a repeating loop', because it looks exactly like that to me. Sure it might not repeat itself 100% every time, but there's little or no variation in the distortion of the logo. If I were to randomly morph between several animations, it would look a lot better (due to the mixing of several movements in random amounts).<br />
<br />
Good idea though, I can imagine this makes a lot of marketing drones' head spin with dollar-signs :).

		A big screen projector and a very powerful machine to run it on ultra high resolutions (640x480 and above) and they used it FOR THAT?<br />
Fuck it! even if it is Tonic who made that... fuck it! That's incredibly stupid and the dm looks really ugly... it could be so much more and it isn't... what a pity.

		The worst part is that, here we are... hard working on our own presets, making them perfect and spending hours to get the music reaction and beat detections right... just for comments and well.. respect i guess... While they are just putting a picture with a dm and making hundreds of dollars out of it! This is not fair.... makes me want to quit doing avs...

		Oh Shut up! If he makes a few bucks good on him! Companies want a simple program that will do that - he want's to make them and earn a few extra bucks a week (not everyone lives off their mummy and daddy). <br />
You wouldn't want anything overly technical when it comes to a logo - brand managers might be histerical if they see their logo twisting and colour changing overly out-rageously - so the technical aspect isn't necessarily an issue. So who gives a sweet fk? If you want - do something better and sell a more expensive pack - buy yourself a new computer with your earnings. Don't diss the dude - I bet if someone offered you ca$h for a preset or two you'd jump at it.

		Nobody's dissing Tonic because he is making money off of this.  It's great if he is making money (I wish I was).  The only thing is that this company is spending $200 or whatever to get this animating logo which has about 15 minutes spent on it and could be done (even better) by many of us.  If I had an offer to do this I know I would take it.  I even hope to make this kind of thing my job after college.  Of course I won't be using Winamp or AVS, I will make my own program, but I plan on sucking every last penny out of these people that want to buy my products.  The only difference is that I will churn out better results than this(No offense meant).

		Hey man, nobody's putting him down. If he can make money, great. It doesn't take great skill to make money at stuff though; it takes good buisness acumen. You have to find or make a market, then grasp control in an iron fist. Gates did the same thing with MS-DOS. He made a deal with IBM and sent out code that he bought off somebody on all their micro-coputers. A great coder he was not.

		Just one more &quot;Nobody is dissing Tonic&quot; post. :)<br />
<br />
I (or should i say WE) don't dislike Tonic because of this, good for him to finally get something back from all the lost years at the keyboard typing avs code...<br />
<br />
But the thing is like this: This is like selling Pentium's (the first ones) to aged people who have money, but don't know nothing about computers. It is just plain and simple pissing in the eye... Now some of you might think this is okay for companies who have loads of money, but in the end it isn't that fair. Imagine if a small company with very little funds tries &quot;one more time&quot; to boost up their image and they decide to try this? Now $179 might not be much, but additional to that they need atleast a 2ghz comp with some fast ram to run the damn thing (if it runs slow at high resolutions it doesn't give a very professional image), so it's going to cost them even more. Not only that it costs money to advertise like this, the people who see it or even pay attention to it will be a very small numbered group (MOST LIKELY) and frankly, i don't think they would even take it seriously or go to the &quot;booth&quot; when they see it. <br />
<br />
Maybe im just talking jibberish for nothing, but the fact remains that paying $179 for something that could be FREE is... well capitalism, but people who make their avs presets for free will feel a little disappointed (i do).<br />
<br />
One more thing is that the company used Tonic's reputation to boost up their image, which makes me feel angry and sad... It hurts my feelings to see the good votes, comments, ratings, reviews WE fellow avs artists wrote for Tonic are used now to make money...

if those companies were interested in something professional, why would they pick avs if there so much better stuff around (e.g. <a href="http://www.resolume.com" target="_blank">resolume</a>)

		The thing is that there isn't much around - they want something creative and 'spiffy' for when they put on their $20,000+ conferences (I know of companies that spend $120,000). I know corporates because I deal with them everyday and have done so for years. He's now found a niche - and he knows that if they see something for $30 its probably going to be shit - and if its $179 believe it or not they'll be more likely to pay for it. Its really quite funny - and I have absolutely no problem with scumming money out of the bastards! The corps get it free in the end when they write it off on a tax claim. They will still see it as something of value, you buy a mcdonalds burger for $3 - but there's always a better way of doing things. Like I said - logo's and branding needs to be really simple - pyscadellic dm's and superscopes are impressive but won't go down too well! Im a graphic artist/multemedia/marketing guy. Sometimes I need to drop my aesthetic quality to make the advert/whatever 'WORK'! And by 'WORK' I mean a scientific application on how it will affect people/brand/product.<br />
<br />
By the way I don't believe he is using his reputation or (more disturbingly) your 'comments'. I doubt anyone will find him through this network! He will have to advertise this product which will co$T $$$$! No-ones going to find his site off a search engine because no-ones going to be looking. He will be working hard to get his product in the right hands - which has so far been the 'unavoidable downfall' of any e-business (unless you've got $$$ like ebay to spend on traditionall advertising).<br />
<br />
Theres no relevance to micro$oft or any other greedy corporate here. If there is something inherently wrong about doing something that makes you money - then you'd probably never get a job. Most artists are bound to end up charging for their work - without it there is no means to survive - hence you won't be an artist anymore. <br />
<br />
But anyway this is all very meaningless gibberish and I hope I haven't bored anyone!

		By the way - a coke at Mcdonalds costs 2c Australian to produce (which is usually absorbed by the cost of the cup!). We are talking about sugar, flavour, water and gas. Value is in the eye of the beholder.
