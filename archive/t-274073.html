<div class="posttext">Hey, Princess Mellow here, looking for people to send in some little tricks to make avs presets easier to create. I know a few little tricks but that is all. :) <br />
<br />
I found out to get the sucking in wormhole effect. The quick easy way is to have a ring and modify the &quot;In and Out&quot; example in Dynamic Movement. You replace the c which is in brackets to any number above 0. To get the pushing out effect you replace the c with a number below 0.<br />
<br />
I will show more little tricks like that asap.<br />
<br />
P.s. Email me at Princess.Mellow.2.0@gmail.com and I will send you the examples in zip unless specified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">There is already a tips and tricks thread. I'm pretty sure you already know that. It just needs to be cleaned up a little, or have all the tricks extracted from them and put in a PDF. I'm sure you can find usefull tips in there, you just gotta look between all the clutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Princess_Mellow</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2007, 02:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">J.Melo. I had a look through other threads and couldn't find anything useful and anyway, like you said, you have to look through the clutter. My thread cleans up the mess. Also people can email me for unanswered questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2007, 10:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well I guess it wont hurt anybody. <br />
<br />
Me and Grandchild found this one out. I don't think it is anywhere else.<br />
<br />
The function atan(a) is faster than atan2(a,b) in a SuperScope, but in a movement, atan2 is slightly faster. Also, in a movement it is better to use atan2 because atan does present some glitches like a dot in the middle and rough edges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Princess_Mellow</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th July 2007, 08:03</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Thanks J.Melo, it;s appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Got another couple of effects.<br />
<br />
A dot fountain and/or plane can look really good with the water effect. Also which I just figured out because I was slow is instead of a scope use a simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Grandchild</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th July 2007, 13:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">a dot fountain + water is what most people here would call outdated and ugly-looking [me included]<br />
...and a scope is so much more powerful than a simple.<br />
<br />
as a general tip to you, since you don't seem very experienced, take some time to get to know what is avs is really about on a higher level and give some tips then.<br />
no offense, but having just a little experience in something usually doesn't qualify someone for giving tips because the bigger picture just isn't there.<br />
 -my point of view at least<br />
<br />
but have you really looked into all the documentation that is there? take a look at visbot.net they have a documents section with tutorials which cover avs partly or as a whole.<br />
[you'll have to wait until next week though since the site is down temporarily]<br />
<br />
but keep up the spirit :)<br />

<br />
those two effects are pretty much as GC said outdated that and they are piles of virtual crap. The only time those effects actualy looked good is when Avsociety was using them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey I'm just trying to help. Anyway I am not going to tell people exactly what to do this is just to get people started. Tutorials, tutorials, tutorials. All you &quot;experianced&quot; people are self taught and didn't use tutorials. Hey I'm self taught and those tutorials are crap! I'm just helping people to self teach themselves so they think and create for themselves. What's wrong with that??? Tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th July 2007, 08:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">There is nothing wrong with that. The others were saying that some of these tips are rather old and it is better to understand AVS better to give tips. Nobody really uses those old render effects or movement examples. It's all about coding SSC's and DM's (mostly). I think it's an okay idea, but I think people that want to learn really ought to read pak-9's AVS programing tut. After reading it, everything just comes naturally from there.<br />
<br />
Edit: WOTL and others are helping to work on an AVS wiki. If it get's done, we can dig through the old Tips and Tricks thread and put together a usefull article.</div></div><hr />

Hey I'm self taught and those tutorials are crap!<br />
number one - not true.<br />
i would consider myself experienced and i did.<br />
<br />
number two - do you really think so? i'm surprised [and a little suspicious] about this harsh judgement. except for &quot;libsuperscope&quot; which is a bunch of errors, the tutorials are ok and in the case of the programming guide simply enlightening.<br />
<br />
and actually: a tutorial and a forum thread with tips are not so far apart, are they?<br />
<br />
don't get me[/us] wrong, though. we don't want you to leave or anything. just allow us to evaluate your tips, since who is any of us to say that her/his tips are good/helpful/justified or not. so i think the wiki (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=274215) j.melo was talking about is a good idea. check it out, contribute once it's up - welcome on the team :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, I took it the wrong way. No offence or anything but I would prefer it if this thread is just tip after tip, without any evaluations unless a tip is on the same reply. Only to keep it clean. And now I will not be a hippocrite anymore.<br />
<br />
The convultion Filter.<br />
<br />
When you go +&gt;Trans&gt;Convultion Filter it comes up with all these boxes and a 1 in the middle. If you move that amount to another box notice what happens (to your rendered object).<br />
<br />
P.s. Glad to be on the team Grandchild. The PM.<br />
<br />
P.p.s. PM me if you can explain somee tips better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Look, this thread is a waste of time and space, mainly bcause of my own ignorance and stubborness. I mean you don't have to use DM for zooming in and out. There is bitterfeed back and roto-blitter. And you're right, who would use a dot fountain + dot plane with water to make a preset. The only one who has done the right thing is J.Melo. You rock dude. Thanks to a lovely mathamatical genius I know I relised something. I SUCK AT CODING. Much better at colour maps and stuff. If this thread doesn't do what it's supposed to do I will be very angry.:hang:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st August 2007, 02:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You're being a bit hard on yourself, no? I do understand why you want to make a Tips and Tricks thread. The old one was full of discussion, and hardly tips. The thing is, all the tips are pretty useless. The only one I've actually used on the other T&amp;T was the HSL to RGB thing. Maybe you suck at coding now, but your more than likely to get better at it as time goes on. AVS coding takes a LOT of patients and time.<br />
<br />
Well, that's my opinion. If you like to hear those tips and tricks, then I'm more than likely to post some in the future. Not many others will be intrested, but a lot of new people might. It could be Tips For Noobs.<br />
<br />
If you want, I'll be more than happy to collaborate. I suck a bit at effects, so that's where you come in :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Princess_Mellow</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st August 2007, 11:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks dude,<br />
<br />
My lovely mathamatical genius friend does all of my coding. His problem is he makes all this stuff with fancy coding, but there is noting interesting about a crazy white line. Then I come in and I say Hmmm mabey a coulour map and a colour clip. Then he says COOL! that's so awesomer than mine, but to be honest I havn't seen your colour techniques, so I might not be that good compared to you. Anyway. It's tip time. Add a simple, some bitter feedback and a colour map. Add a few colours and hey presto! some colours. If you don't do it right and it flashes in between 2 colours experiment somemore.<br />
<br />
P.s. Whats up with noobs, Supertoast is obsessed with noobs and now it's infectiong people! (no offence I was just wondering):)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok well I started out the same way you did. I tried to do stuff on my own for the first two months. Everything I did in the beginning was totally random and I was just trying to see what will happen with every code and I tried to understand other codes from other presets. <br />
<br />
After two months I kinda knew all the basics. After that I read Pak's tutorial and I learned a lot of stuff. Personally I recommend reading Pak's tutorial even though you may not understand it from the first time. Just take everything step by step. You won't learn everything over night.<br />
<br />
Most big avs people work on avs for years and still don't know everything about it. Avs is very complex and you will need a lot of time to understand everything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">my tip: use less channel shifts, it's very difficult to get decent results in my opinion. for color-changing i prefer the use of colormaps, to produce less random results.</div></div><hr />
