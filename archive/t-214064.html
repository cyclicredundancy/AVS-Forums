<div class="posttext">ok its not as if i know how to use linux, but i just ended up with 2 computers, and only one copy of windows xp and i dont feel like installing it on 2 machines, and im reading through some linux tutorial right now...<br />
<br />
anyway, is there like a way to run avs for linux? i do know that winamp is obviously windows only, but it would be so cool if i can make it so that avs is the only program installed on a computer...</div></div><hr />

There really aren`t other options currently.<br />
AVS runs fine under wine with small speed loss for rendering effects and little bigger speed loss for trans effects. There are some extra bugs, like texer 2 doesn`t display colours  properly and some minor ones that I can`t recall atm. Maybe newest version of wine fixes them, but i aint going to recompile it (*cough* how about compilation well over 1 hour?)<br />
<br />
As for alternative, libvisual guys are currently working on libvisual-avs, it is very far from being finished, but you can keep your eyes open for future releases. There also are many visualisations around, but if you ask me, they all blow (tho' some can even be fun for 2 minutes, like project-M).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">eh... wow so visualizations for linux do exist... like, arent there places for things like these , like in clubs and venues and stuff, where a cheap little computer sits in one corner and hooks up to a huge plasma screen or projector , running some free OS like linux and all they have to do is switch it on and it generates fancy visuals, perhaps responding to sound too... <br />
hm i guess i'll just google for 'libvisual' , by the sounds of it its the most promising one<br />
<br />
::edit:: and the libvisual website has a link congratulating the projectm team for their newest release , and for including libvisual support , so i guess my next task would be to go ahead and install opengl in linux (uhhh?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">visualizations dont need cheap little computers<br />
they need expensive huge workstations :P<br />
(at least avs does)</div></div><hr />
