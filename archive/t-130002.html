<div class="posttext">Superscopes are much better, IMO.  I am much better at using them, too.</div></div><hr />

DMs are nothing without SSC. Well, you can manage without it, but you'll be mostly confined to slow speeds for cool presets and even slower for cool textures.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">DMs are definately making the best new presets - texture, colour and form add alot more interesting features. I guess it is a partnership really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ssc's of course ( because I still dont know everything about dm's )<br />
and it is the most powerful tool of avs.<br />
what can you do with a dm without textture? and a good texture can be obtained with the use of ssc's.<br />
without ssc's, a dm would be of no use. ( except when you use bitmaps for the texture ).<br />
of course you can make textures without ssc's but then.........</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I refuse to answer such a question. The other just can't exist without the other. They need each other to work perfectly, otherwise it's just a dm preset or just a superscope preset.<br />
<br />
And yes i know i have made only superscope presets, but those all sucked and you know that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i fully agree.  ssc is the dm of render, and dm is the ssc of trans.  they are, simply put, the makings of any good vis - avs or otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If i had to choose i would prefer the DM. Because you could create a SSC out of a simple scope and a DM.<br />
<br />
But anyway i agree with Atero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I choose...both :)<br />
example - Superscope for looks DM for background or a cool simple scope and a smooth 3d dm.<br />
Magic : you can create a superscope from a superscope and a dynamic movement ? eh ??? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th March 2003, 11:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Frankly, i never tried out, because i'ts a painfull process. But it's possible after all and the work needed could be calculated like this:<br />
<br />
work for dm + ss = sqr( work for ssc )<br />
<br />
But we could do a contest if you want, best pseudo SSC wins :p</div></div><hr />

It just woudltn work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Movements have something SSC severly lack:  bilateral filtering (anti-aliasing).  So, naturually, if you want a really good looking preset, you should stick Movements.</div></div><hr />

Why don't you use asci code? <br />

<div class="posttext">Dynamic Movement is a very useful tool for creating movement effects... but I believe that the best AVS presets are those with a 3rd dimensional aspect to them. DMs can be used to render 3D objects using raytracing... the only problem is that that limits what you can create and it often looks ugly. SSCs have much more power for creating 3D geometry and run faster than DMs.<br />
<br />
Besides... can DMs do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2003, 20:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, that's insane. Amazing job jheriko, i love the dark grey shading and the perfect movement, well done :up:<br />
<br />
I still say this topic is a waste of web space, presets need a good mix of DM's and superscopes, or one of each. Isn't the idea to make good presets, not to decide which bits of AVS are better? I still prefer DM's and scopes though. Like this:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2003, 21:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's an awesome preset Jheriko. Hope it's going into your next pack.  That's the best animated human-like figure I've seen in AVS, if only it was music responsive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2003, 22:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you... I would have made it more responsive but I would have had to do a different sort animation or make the camera move around a lot more... I might make him dance next time around. I will tweak that preset some more before release though.<br />
<br />
Nice preset you have there Raz... here's my advice: Remove the stolen DM background and make your name spin in 3D. Also since it is all straight lines you could extrude the shape into a 3D version. Then you would have a really neat intro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2003, 23:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't steal it, i duplicated the effect with my own code. I will make it 3d and spin though, already working on it. You've officially made the best figures in avs though. No-ones going to beat that in a hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2003, 23:11</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Apology on the stolen thing... but it does look a lot like Retrosquares.</div></div><hr />

I would have loved to do that, but the problem is My Keypad WONT work! .<br />

<div class="posttext">We spend out time discussing and working on a piece of sub-software of another piece of software. Outside is a strange and dangerous place :p<br />
<br />
It does look a lot like retrosquares, it was originally just slightly rippling and not really beat detective, then i looked at retrosquares and decided to try and duplicate the effect. I probably won't release it because it's been done almost exactly before it just fitted the nice scope i made.</div></div><hr />
