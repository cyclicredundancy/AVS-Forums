      <p class="post-content"><strong>Live Link to the 3d tutorial?</strong><br />
      So sorry, I'm really bad at rememberring how to properly spell handles. El-Vis's 3d superscopes tutorial. Anyone know where there's a live link to it? I should have downloaded it ages ago, but figured I wouldn't be able to wrap my brain around it. I feel like maybe I can grasp what's presented in the tutorial now. So a live link would be greatly appreciated :D</p>

      Personally, I prefer Pak-9's AVS Programming Guide. Which, consequently, appears on that page as well. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I never even downloaded El-Vis' tutorial, because I thought it would be way too advanced. I can wrap my brain round Pak-9's explanations though. Hey, I even hand bound Pak-9's guide. One of the 99 cent stores had these book binding covers. So at a buck, I wasn't going to leave the pack on the shelf.<br />
      <br />
      Since Pak-9's guide makes my stapler punk out on me, I hand bound it with a Japanese bookbinding stitch. It's so very Martha Stewart of me :P Yeah that's right, I'm gangsta like Martha, which means not very :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, so following El-Vis's tut, I've got my crummy, no-megabuffers heart rotating about, and added some color to it. Rotation's random and ugly, going to re-read Pak-9's info on 3d and rotation. Try and break it down to it's parts and then make this thing rotate in only one direction.<br />
      <br />
      Criminy but even 3d software makes me think of Battleship. So I'm trying to figure out how I'll make it rotate in one direction, and also how to move it along the z axis so that it will move as I please. This is one of those "I'll figure it out in my sleep" situations. You know, the times when you're trying to figure out some code and then it comes to you when you're sleeping, or making a cup of coffee, then you have to either remember when you wake up, or hurry and grab a piece of paper and scribble it down.<br />
      <br />
      Feeling like I may be able to wrap my brain around triangles soon. But I know they'll be pretty much useless till I get the hang of megabuffs and registers. Still, I'm another baby step closer to making really cool things happen. So I'm happy about it.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, ridiculous question. In as much as it's surely simple to everyone else. When you see rot as in rotx or rotz, does rot stand for rotation? Also is it an actual variable like band, bnot, and so forth?</p>
