<br />
<div class="posttext">Its almost here,<br />
Heres an almost complete update of whats to come,<br />
Hes learned new tricks, Made many presets ( Ive made like 55, but as you can see only about 27 have made the cut. )<br />
I am interested in seeing what you think of this,<br />
I have Improved BEYOND BELIEF!<br />
And after this, is coming my Best of/Remix Pack. ;)  :D<br />
<br />
BTW&lt; For size reasons, I didnt include the Required APEs,<br />
You should have them anyway<br />
<br />
Texer<br />
Channelshift<br />
Convo <br />
<br />
etc.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, i'll try to do a preset by preset review :)<br />
<br />
Arcane - 2.0 - Nice, quite peaceful and smooth. Good effect with the mosaic too.<br />
<br />
Deviant's Revenge - All of them pretty much lack all beat detection &amp; music reaction and they just look good, except the one with only the scope, that looks kinda empty.<br />
<br />
Diego 2.0 - Not much to say about this. Looks pretty basic and i don't like the channel shift.<br />
<br />
Diego - Cel Remix - Check above.<br />
<br />
Phazer Speaker - Add a fadeout.<br />
<br />
Felluca - Nice job on re-creating duo's preset, but it looks pretty dull and doesn't slide&amp;swing like the original.<br />
<br />
Fortification - Justin's fireworks Kaliadascope mk 2 again?<br />
<br />
In Secret Love we drown - Nice dm &amp; pattern, but the pattern could look more continous and it could have some colors to spice it up.<br />
<br />
Dragonmatrix - Decent remix. Every other line blend makes it look a bit nicer.<br />
<br />
Machinaeon - Another board preset. The idea is beaten to death you know? Of course board presets are cool sometimes if the pattern is great, but the pattern in this one looks ugly to tell the truth.<br />
<br />
Nightstar 2.0 - Again the fyrewurx &amp; water like in the last preset (above). Static &amp; unreactive. Not good.<br />
<br />
Nocturnal Pulse - Moves, Good beat detection, good pattern. You did a good job. On of the better presets of the pack.<br />
<br />
Shrine of Spirituality - Dull &amp; unreactive. Really basic.<br />
<br />
Stargazer's Dream - Again moving particles &amp; effect lists. And what is that dynamove doing there? It seems to have no effect on the preset.<br />
<br />
Superspyro - Looks nice, but unreactive.<br />
<br />
Taloria - A word of advice: Using d,r,x,y in any other section than pixel has no effect whatsoever. If you're not making the last dynamove dynamic, then why to use it in the first place? A regular movement is faster &amp; more accurate.<br />
<br />
Trammel - The last dynamove is pretty classic. The dm above it could use some randomized beat detection.<br />
<br />
Ultimate Trap - Again lacking in music reaction. The Spyro one looks nice tho.<br />
<br />
Vertigo - Can't really say i like them.<br />
<br />
White Dragon - Nice colors and glow. Simple yet nice and music reactive scope. Blending effects are good too. Best preset in the pack and the one that made me to write this whole review :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Still pretty basic stuff you got here, but i see some improving in the presets. You could need some more learning in how to make presets music/beat reactive and some coding since sometimes your code made no sense or had no effect.<br />
<br />
Keep trying :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, thanks for the Review dude, I have decided to scrap Diego and Vetigo and their Remixes, I can do way better since I wrote them. Also I noticed some of my errors, like Taloria, ( It was just something I forgot to remove in the Dev Process. Most of my mistakes are. ) Also getting the ass is my Nightstar Rehash, alsom the main thrill with Machinaeon is the fact that it is a rehash of a preset from 'Anarchy' ( this time I used 100% my own code. ) that was what made it special. Also no one seeing my theme for this pack ( with some of the namings at least? )?<br />
New Devpack coming soon, Ive made several new presets since,<br />
No more N00bish stuffz :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you do you manage to write such long reviews?<br />
:confused:<br />
i will give this one 3 stars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Ches Dragon</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th March 2003, 06:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well I am actually more interested of what you think Preset by Preset.<br />
Any ones that stood out, Liked or Disliked?<br />
Its only a dev release, so I can see what to improve upon. Please make it easy for me to do this. I praise Tuggummi for such an esy to understand and read review of the current progress.<br />
Using it I helped myself much.<br />
Now?<br />
Surely someone else has some improvements to add, that dont involve starting again or destruction... ;)  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">shreyas, you mean how do i/we/somebody manages to write such long reviews? Well a preset by preset review is actually very easy, just keep the forum in the background and winamp &quot;always on top&quot; and just comment on the presets as you shuffle trough them. The harder part is to come up with something to say in the end that helps the author overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Ches Dragon</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th March 2003, 06:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">too right, Tugs review helped me lots, I just eed more people to help in that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Ches Dragon</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th March 2003, 10:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Heres a smallish update dudes.<br />
Removed some AVS,<br />
Added 1 new preset to the pack,<br />
Eternal Winter, showing how silly 4 superscopes can become</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th March 2003, 10:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Eternal Winter looks good, tho it could be a bit more dynamic. Use r=r*3 instead of r=r*3.14159+3 and add a rotating dynamic movement above it. That should make it a bit more dynamic. Or use something else, i dunno :)<br />
<br />
Nice uptades. :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th March 2003, 11:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I tought eternal winter looked pretty static, and I'd drop fortification. I'm not too crazy about the Deviants revenge line in there either.<br />
<br />
Overall not bad. Most seem to react to the music in some way or another, though sometimes it's hard to tell. I'd avoid using the fireworks APE just because.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heres a nice update for you all, one or more new AVS, many changes to others,<br />
<br />
Dragon - Alchemy<br />
<br />
An attempt to recreate WMP like visuals, and I suceeded except for the true mix n match feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 09:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The new preset is pretty good.<br />
The rest just looked the same, didn't actually even bother to look at them that close :p<br />
<br />
When are you going to publish it? I doubt you can go on forever uptading it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Ches Dragon</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 09:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Soon Hopefully, I just need to get a few more Presets down and finish the comments, do you think that it is ready to publish now? I want it to score the best it can on Winamp.com<br />
So I want to make it the 10/10 effort I can,<br />
Plus im gonna fix the NSIS template up for it,.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th March 2003, 09:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">uhm... well i doubt it's going to get the highest there is, only whacko series have been able to pull that one of :p<br />
<br />
And you are ready when you think you are ready. No one can tell that you except you.</div></div><hr />
