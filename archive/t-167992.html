      thought you might like to throw some rocks,and knock some holes in some of my presets!:D . If your prone to seisures,pay close attention to "In the center of it all"!In other words use at your own risk!:igor: (This message brought to you by the law offices of Duowe,Sruem,&amp; Howe.);)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm glad you loathed my presets so much! I got to thinking as to what "Fullsceen Video Mode" you were running. I designed these Running In fullsceen "1280x720@32BPP with fullscreen overlayed mode on,pixel doubling on, wait for retrace off, set at the highest framerate, and vert. screen height at 100%. I also designed these with syncopational beats and pentatonic scales in mind. Blithering idiot that I am, I didn't think that everyone might not be able to run at that mode! Sorry about that, hope the therapist is helping with the trauma and that you'll be out of the hospital very soon. :D In the meantime these might look a little better running at "400x300@32BPP" hope you hate these just as much! Oh! BTW HungrySkull have you ever thought of feeding that skull? :D You bad man you!:weird: :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">The first one (not the sphere) is Decent, changes colours a bit too quick though. But the sphere one kinda sucks, it doesn't move or change it just flashes different colours really fast.</p>
