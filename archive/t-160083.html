I found myself muttering 'genious' on more than one occasion. Loved Seismogrid, Tokyo Bullet and Don't trip and drive the best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In one word...<br />
<br />
WOW.<br />
<br />
In many...<br />
<br />
Yum - Yummy indeed. Very nice color scheme. Great superscope-created texture. The TV theme works very well here. Excellent choice for an intro.<br />
<br />
Blueprint Isometrica - Very cool tile preset. There's some kind of illusion of depth going on here and I like it.<br />
<br />
Isometrica - Cool, but not very dynamic. I liked the Blueprint version better.<br />
<br />
Rainbow Ball - You're right, it does look organic. Sweet colors, like oil in water or something.<br />
<br />
Goldie - This preset is godlike. Best 3D object preset ever. Best spectrum preset ever. Best use of color in a preset ever. Magnificant. I appreciate the work done to get the planes drawn in order too.<br />
<br />
Goolicious - Extremely impressive technical preset. The DM looks hella-complicated. Colors aren't bad either.<br />
<br />
License to Chill - Hahaha, what a cheesy name. Sweet as hell preset though. That dancer is really convincing. Awesome work.<br />
<br />
Daedalus - Great use of math to make cool shapes. Very mystical (as I'm sure it was intended to be). This one is easy to look at.<br />
<br />
Insane Architect - AAH too much! I liked the origional better, but the colors aren't bad on this. The proplem is that even soft music makes the scope go fucking insane!<br />
<br />
Stick Around - Love the coloring. The texture in the orange areas is awsome. Very effective illustration of depth.<br />
<br />
Seismogrid - Possibly my favorite preset ever. Texer and scopes go together PERFECTLY. Amazing wavelike movement. Colors add so much to this movement. You got this effect nailed.<br />
<br />
Fiber Optics - I've seen similar presets, but this is my favorite. The texture is what sets it apart. Great visualization of the inside of a fiber optic cable.<br />
<br />
Rusty Curls - Cool texture. Interesting colors. Not the best of the pack though.<br />
<br />
Phoenix - Very simple and nice. However, I think you should stick to the more original, creative, and/or technical stuff UnConeD. This just doesn't compare to what other AVSers have done with these types of presets. Stiff, it's not bad.<br />
<br />
Come Fly With Me - Another effect nailed perfectly.It eally feels like a cartoon. I don't have a lot to say about this, except that it is a truly original preset that works just like it should. Great work!<br />
<br />
VJ Chmutov - Amazing. I love how you make this DM look like a solid shape. The camera moves perfectly too. The red tone works excellently too. It seems to slow down in framerate when the camera isn't pointed at the opject though. Odd. Still sweet as fuck though.<br />
<br />
Hello Light - Very cool. The colors aren't perfect though. I see what kind of scheme you were going for with the aqua and red, but it could use a bit of tweaking. I prefer the original, but this isn't bad either.<br />
<br />
Silk Strings - This looks so effortless (and yet I know it's actually a product of hours or work). Perfect colors, amazingly smooth movement. I love it.<br />
<br />
Bipolar - This is cool. A nicely lit, colorfully blurred preset. A little too fast for me though.<br />
<br />
Tokyo Bullet - Sweet! This is a huge improvement over the original.  Very creative signs and whatnot. Great, smooth movement. So much work went into this and it SHOWS!<br />
<br />
Elevation - Ha, thanks for mentioning me! I know I've said this before, but great preset. This is what I had in mind when making Claustrophobia.<br />
<br />
Don't Trip and Drive - Normally I wouldn't like these outrageous colors. But considering the fact that this whole preset is outrageous, I like them a lot! Great interactivity, and awesome technical work.<br />
<br />
Around the World - This is a great way to end the pack. The way the flags are created is awesome. The patterns are perfect. Great wavy movement, as usual for you. The BG actually adds a lot to this preset too. Great choice of coloring for it.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
&quot;Hopefully I will have caught you by surprise by releasing this pack. I said there wouldn't be a Whacko AVS VII, and in a way it's still true: this pack was created with a different mindset.<br />
<br />
Whacko AVS was about making your eyes jump out of their sockets, Final Whack is about me doing what I want with AVS and creating really weird, wicked presets. Maybe the end result is somewhat similar to Whacko AVS, but I still think there's a difference.&quot;<br />
-UnConeD<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, this is a new direction for you - a new direction that has so much room for exploration. I really hope that the title Final Whack does not mean that this is your last pack. That would be a shame, because this pack, more than any other you've made, shows that you aren't out of ideas. Instead, it seems to convey confidently that there is a lot of potential in your brain and in AVS in general.<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that this pack is so unique and different from any other pack ever made, I'm not going to give it a rating. Just know that as of right now, it's my favorite pack and will be for some time, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What do this pack and the matrix reloaded have in common?  <br />
<br />
They are both technically insane, and after they are over, you have to take a deeeeep breath. :D <br />
<br />
IT IS DA BOMB!  IT'S TEH GRANDMASTA ATOM BOMB, G!  <br />
<br />
I was actually laughing from the unbelievable things that I just saw done in AVS.  These visuals are so...intense, that I just started to laugh at their craziness. <br />
<br />
Pretty good way to start out the revolution of AVS, I must say. :up: <br />

<div class="posttext">Hmm... So when you made your packs before you did them for... what reason? To prove some technical point that &quot;avs can indeed dig it&quot; O_o<br />
<br />
The minute you started to make presets you like and not for making a point, you started making stuff that is better than any of the previous whacko's alltogether.<br />
<br />
My absolute favorite is Goldie, i just love it to death. I'll probably go blind staring at it while playing my playlist through :D (btw. should be pretty fitting for the rap you see on Mtv :p &quot;too bad&quot; i don't listen to it :blah: )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm really impressed with the voxel usage in Don't Trip and Drive.  That looks really damn good man.  Silk Strings looks incredible.  Fiber Optics is also a very nice effect you pulled off.  Seismogrid is one of my favs of the pack but I like it with a toned down texer image.  Daedalus looks pretty damn good and mathy and god knows I love the mathiness lol.  Never was a fan of the dancing people presets but it looks cool and I can appreciate the time and effort put into it.  Nice rendering in goldie.  Very smooth.  Wasn't a big fan of Stick Around and Rusty Curls but still nice looking presets.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed it.  Some of them are really amazing music visualizations.  Others are just technically jaw dropping.  Most of them I just sit the thinking, &quot;how the hell did he do that!?&quot;  And then I give up and realize I probably wouldn't understand anyways, but man...  what you have have in that head up there is something else.  Good job.</div></div><hr />

Where did you get that idea for rendering Dont Trip and Drive?  Is there a name for that style of rendering?  It looks like raycasting to me but I dont know if you changed it or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just a classic voxel renderer... same technique as in Mission to Mars from Whacko VI, except optimized, with better shading, and now resolution independent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but there are two kind of 'voxel renderers'. One is the classic demo scene landscape effect that I recreated, and another is the literal meaning of voxels (volume pixels), where an object is built out of tiny colored cubes and rendered that way.<br />
Maybe you're confusing those.<br />
<br />
The name for my effect is not completely wrong though. Originally, you'd have a grayscale bitmap that depicted height. You could imagine a landscape being built from this by converting every pixel into a vertical bar of a certain height. Every bar would be a volume-equivalent of a pixel, so also a voxel. Remember, 'pixel' stands for 'picture element', so 'voxel' is 'volume element'. The bars in the classic effect are just as much volume-elements as the 'real' cubic voxels.<br />
<br />
Mine doesn't use a bitmap for a heightfield, but rather a function in 2 variables. But the rendering method is still the same as the old way (stepping over the landscape and comparing the projected height of the last step to the current).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Copy and paste the link.  Yeah ok that's where I got confused.  I hadn't seen this effect in AVS so it was a new idea to me.  Cool effect though.  I'll have to remember that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't Trip And Drive is my favorite, I had a blast ramping off the hills! (A good way to get a good framerate but a big window is to just make the window full screen, instead of clicking the fullscreen button, it goes about 2X as fast)<br />
<br />
Fiberoptics is amazing too! <br />

YOU ARE A GENIOUS!</div></div><hr />
