      <p class="post-content"><strong>Preset idea, steel balls in a speaker cone.</strong><br />
      Saw this in a video the other night, thought it'd be a cool preset idea.<br />
      <br />
      The video had a bunch of shiny steel balls (like pachinko sized balls) inside of a subwoofer speaker cone. Every time there was a bass hit, the balls would all go rolling around hitting each other.<br />
      <br />
      It looked cool as hell, i'd love to have something like that as an AVS preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sure, but don't think it'll be done soon. I'm kinda sick right now, and I don't want to spend much time on the computer; just more time in bed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm this sounds like megabuf work.<br />
      an idea for a preset to check out that matchs the description of this idea would be Pak-9's Droplets preset.<br />
      It uses music instead of bass hits to move its particles but the principle is still the same.<br />
      <br />
      The louder the bass hit the higher the balls go.</p>

      Yeah, that's the first preset I thought of when this was mentioned...I don't see any megabuf work that needs to be done, though. I guess it depends on how many particles you want to render. It might be better to do each metal ball in it's own SSC, though. It'll look nicer if you give it some specular highlights with proper lighting.</p>
