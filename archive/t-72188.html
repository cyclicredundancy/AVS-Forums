<div class="posttext">This is another new preset made by me.<br />
<br />
By the way, this one is not what you would expect from me.  This one is &quot;different&quot;....maybe my entering into a different section of the AVS world. :)<br />
<br />
Check it out, tell me what you think.  Feedback is appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Very Nice!:) I am always satisfied by the way your colors blend and work together and I see why it reminds you of exploring another planet. I must remind you however to streamline your visuals before you send them out. One of the movement effects, the dynamic movement, and the mirror had no use other then to hoard the system resourses. While that may be no big deal for people running fast computers, it is a serious drain for those running slower. <br />
<br />
On a side note, when do you plan on sending an offical pack off to Nullsoft for review?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Solamon, I see your point.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can be my go-between so I won't hoard everyone's resources?  This creation was a &quot;spur of the moment&quot; type deal, and sometimes when I create stuff, and I like it, I want to instantly save it so I don't lose it again.<br />
<br />
As for sending out a pack to Winamp, it will probably be about another couple of weeks.  I'm nearing the 15 preset mark, and I'm hoping to get them out to the public ASAP.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Thanx.<br />

<div class="posttext">Interesting.  You usually do a preset.<br />
<br />
If there's something wrong with it, why don't you try and see what you can do to make it better?  You always tell me what's wrong with it, so why don't ya show me?<br />
<br />
