<div class="posttext">Before you post anything, SEARCH THE FORUMS!  Your question (especially if it's a question on tutorials) may have already been answered.  If it hasn't, UnConeD recently put together a list of tutorials on winamp that have been posted in the forum, so look for his thread and go there and see.  If you can't find an answer, then you may post your question.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if it's a question along the lines of &quot;How do I use/program AVS/DM's/Superscopes?&quot; that is not as easily answered as it seems.  A plethora of tutorials of this sort are being written as we type, which cover most of the ground you'd probably be trodding upon.  Until they come out in a great flood of death and blood, you'll just have to wait - which is probably a good thing.  You can probably learn about as much as there is to know about AVS's effects and construction by just playing with it for a couple of weeks.  And if you want to know how to program DM's/Superscopes, LEARN THE MATH.  It's not going to come to you in a dream, for Christ's sake!  AVS's programming language is incredibly simple, and if you know intermediate algebra, then you'll get it in a snap.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have an explicitly specific question, e-mail one of the more knowledgable people on this forum; I'm not exactly sure who's here, but that would include me.  I can probably answer most of your questions, unless you want to know about supergenious DM's that run at a 3fps, in which case, for the good of America, don't swallow more than you can chew.<br />

<br />
Now that's a neat typo :)... couldn't resist.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if an AVS FAQ would be possible, unless it's a book. What most people want is an explanation of how each component works. For some, like the Superscope or Dynamic Movement, a short answer simply isn't possible... unless of course we simply collect all threads/posts for a certain question and post the URLs.</div></div><hr />
