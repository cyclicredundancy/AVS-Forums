      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hookin visualizations to tracks in playlist</strong><br />
      Have read that visualizations in winamp3 can be hooked to specific tracks:up:, the dumb question now is HOW? is it done in transitions or where?<br />

      <p class="post-content">AVS itself is a plugin. The presets (or AVSs) are not. They just change how AVS is working. I don't think you can associate a preset with a specific song. (Not that I read the docs mind you.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">? Hermit can you attach a different vis to a different track?<br />
      <br />
      This is strange because the only vis plug-in for WA3 is AVS so you only have a option of attached that one plug-in (compenet whatever)?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>copied right out of forums</strong><br />
      here it is copied out of the forums ----&gt;For instance, you could display a CD cover or start a specific visualization every time a certain song began to play. The possibilities are endless, and the ability for Component crosstalk means the playlist editor will only grow more powerful as time goes by.&lt;--------<br />
      <br />
      so now how is it done????<br />
      <br />
      ps. it also says you can adjust the crossfade (not that I'd want to) but don't tell us how to do that either.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think the quoted text is referring to the fact that something like this is *possible* with Winamp3's component model. It doesn't mean this functionality is implemented though.</p>

      To Xion(810): don't know what or where properties menu is... if u mean preferences I don't see ne thing there for crossfade adjustments<br />
      thanks 4 reply<br />
      <br />
      To UnConeD: If it not part of winamp3-- hope someone is workin on making it happen (love idea of hookin vis's to tracks... had the idea long time ago and sent to musicmatch[where they can hook some things to track]) I haven't 'nuff knowledge or would do it myself.<br />
      Also read somewhere (think in same article) that avs will be able to play visuals made for elsewhere (but now u gots me thinkin it not availible yet) does that mean that all visuals i made ages ago for musicmatch will be abled to be played here in winamps3 avs:up: :up: :D ???<br />
