<div class="posttext">I need some help doing anything that requires algorithms that you can do in Winamp.  I have made a couple decent AVS preset packs, one of which is still waiting to be published.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have or know where I can find ANY kind of documentation to help me with the AVS presets?  (websites, documents, emails, forums that EXPLAIN everything).  I'm not a math or computer programming major, but I do know a fair share in both fields.<br />
<br />
Anyone got some clues?:igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*wants to scream, &quot;NOT ANOTHER ONE!!!*<br />
<br />
The AVS programming is just mathematics applied to the very basic assignment principle used in every single programming language you can think of.<br />
<br />
BUT I have finished a tutorial on the subject, but I want to finish the entire project before I publish it.  When I'm done the masses can rejoice (and stop bugging us).<br />
<br />
So until then you'll have to wait - I'm fairly sure you'll figure it out by the time I'm done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Perhaps a more specific request than &quot;help&quot;. Try &quot;please help me with...&quot; and you may get a useful answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">See that's the thing.  I don't know what I need to ask for help on!  I don't have any particular ideas, I'm just looking for general help on algorithms and the mathematical language.<br />
<br />
Maybe all I need to know is what variables do what.  c, d, x, y, z...etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Go to Rovastar's thread about &quot;Variable list.&quot;  I explained the superscopes 10 fixed variables there.  If you know much trig, you should know what r and d are - and x and y are a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you may find some stuff in the unconed' tread &quot;frequently asked questions) to the top of the avs forum page</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">d=distance<br />
r=rotation<br />
x=axis x -<br />
y=axis y |<br />
(in superscope r=red g=green b=blue)<br />
z=? mayby zoom...don't remember i seen it anywere<br />
bah anyway if you seek thus the forum you may find some big talk about alot of stuff<br />
<br />
i'd be more helpfull but memory is sometimes forgetting:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey Mucks, z isn't a fixed variable, it's a custom one, you've to code so it can change distance !</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">- Read the first page of recent topics<br />
- Read the FAQ<br />
- Use the SEARCH FEATURE<br />
<br />
My guess is that you could've answered most of your questions that way. Ever since forums became popular, most people seem to have an irritating &quot;Help me, I'm clueless!&quot; reflex. Don't know about the rest, but I always read a manual/faq/existing docs before possibly annoying an entire forum with an all-too-common question.</div></div><hr />
