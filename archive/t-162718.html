<div class="posttext">With Winamp5 comes a new plugin called Signal Processing Studio DSP. It's a fully codable Digital Signal Processing plugin with the same codebase as AVS (well, at least the coding language and syntax is the same). It also allows you to create sounds.<br />
<br />
What would seem really cool to me, is to enable SPS and AVS to exchange global variables between eachother. You could make a AVS game with sound. This could be done either by exchanging the global registers we have already, or by using a APE that allows you to broadcast a few global registers to SPS.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this idea?<br />
<br />
BTW, you should really play with SPS some time. All you avs coders should have no problem learning the coding language. You can use SPS for both DSP and to create your own sounds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah so far I've been mucking around with SPS and made 2D audio rotation, 2D audio (XZ Stereo), and a pitch-preserving half tempo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I made a cool &quot;Bell-In-Da-Can&quot; effect :) SPS is a lot of fun :)<br />
<br />
:up: Here's my vote for intergation of AVS and SPS (it even sounds alike :p)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think it would be great. I don't fully understand SPS yet, though I've played around with it a little, and it looks like great fun :). As far as I know, there is no such thing as &quot;frame&quot; like in Superscope and DM, but then for 10th of a second or so? (I mean, you can't do things like t=t-0.05)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Per sample should work like per frame. The only problem is that I don't how many samples there are in a second.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">skupers: use srate for amount of samples per second.<br />
<br />
Here are some of my SPS presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's one of mine. I tried to make a tone generator and it ended up pretty nice. It uses arrays to add a lot of sines together. <br />

Maybe you guys have anything to this thread: SPS My SPS Wishlist (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=1226084).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The problem is not so much firebird, but vBulletin which doesn't use proper encoding for filenames as far as I know.<br />
I recall the RFC saying something like &quot;for now, we only support ascii filenames without spaces&quot;... I don't know if there is an updated spec, but it seems crazy that today, with UTF8 and such around, there is no good way to define freeform filenames.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">not only that, &quot;;-c&quot; is stupid.  why the hell do you expect people to type in such an obnoxious handle when speaking to you?  ; and - are not regularly used charachters to begin with, let alone in conjunction with each other.<br />
<br />
plus i refuse to refer to people with handles that i can't actually pronounce.<br />

<div class="posttext">I didn't even know NSPS existed... but now that I've seen it I'd have to say its very cool. Integration with AVS would be great. Some very atmospheric presets could be created.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi. I made my first SPS-preset. Have a look at it it has an adjustable stereo-widener and delay.<br />
Where's the SPS-preset download-section? We definitely need one!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i made this bass boost setting :D it's overkill on some songs so it's adjustable<br />

thanks unconed for that simple lowpass :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry for reviving this thread, but I thought of something.  Integrating AVS and SPS wouldn't be as simple as sharing variables, it might require some wierd synchonization tricks to keep AVS and SPS at the same place, due to the 0-2 second DSP lag.</div></div><hr />
