<div class="posttext">I was wondering. Is there a plugin that will detect beats in MIDI files?  I cannot get the AVSs to respond to midi files.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />

<div class="posttext">This is a rather hard thing to do, because, as anyone who knows much about MIDI, there is no set MIDI sound.  You would have to interrupt the sound just before it goes out to the speakers, and then proccess it.  It seems to me that would take up a large amount of proccessor time.  Also, you would pick up all the microphone and WAV noise as well.  The alternative would be to take the commands in the MIDI itself and make AVS respond to those.  This, however, would make the response rather poor, as some MIDI devices have loud drums, high bass, blunt noise, etc.  The ideal situation would be to pass the MIDI through a MIDI device and see what sounds it produces, and then use only that data in AVS, but that also seems like it would take too long, and it might even be something that could change computer to computer.<br />
So no, as far as I know there is not a plug that can make response to MIDI in AVS.</div></div><hr />
