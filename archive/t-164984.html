      <p class="post-content"><strong>Whacko's Meatballs</strong><br />
      Just got win5pro. It crashes when I attempt to enter whacko's meatballs from the render list (it crashes as soon as I click on it)... but if I make preset in winamp3 and drag it over to win5 it will play. So why can't I use it in win5 being as it is <u>PAYED for</u> and win 3 is free??:confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here are some facts you might want to know:[list=a][*]Jaak is right, don't use precoded effects[*]Secondly, it's metaballs not meatballs[*]Another thing AVS comes with the free version too[/list=a]<br />

      <p class="post-content">First of all, Metaballs APE has nothing to do with Winamp Pro or not. I wrote it, and I didn't get paid for it and I'm not associated with Nullsoft.<br />
      <br />
      Metaballs APE is known to crash on XP with Winamp5. I do not intend to release a fix for it, because:<br />
      a) I'm too lazy to do the whopping task of replacing one line of code.<br />
      b) It's a boring APE.<br />
      <br />
      The reason it works in an existing preset is because it crashes when you open the config window, which also happens when adding it to a preset. As long as you don't touch it in an existing preset, it'll work fine.</p>

      <blockquote>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you UnConed for letting me know that metaball (meatballs as I call 'em)is incompatible with win5 in xp !! It is what I needed to know ,,, Not a bunch of bullshit from troublemakers saying what I can or cannot do on my own puter. AVS is supposed to be about making presets and having fun but coming here to forums for a little HELP seems to bring out the morons that just want to cause trouble.<br />
      And as far as being payed for I meant win5 pro not your ape and I have had every winamp from 2.77 on up (cept beta) including free win5....</p>
