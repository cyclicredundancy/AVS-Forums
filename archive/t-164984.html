<div class="posttext">Just got win5pro. It crashes when I attempt to enter whacko's meatballs from the render list (it crashes as soon as I click on it)...  but if I make preset in winamp3 and drag it over to win5 it will play. So why can't I use it in win5 being as it is PAYED for and win 3 is free??:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here are some facts you might want to know:<br />
[list=a]<br />
 Jaak is right, don't use precoded effects<br />
 Secondly, it's metaballs not meatballs<br />
 Another thing AVS comes with the free version too<br />
[/list=a] <br />
<br />
It is your kinda shit that NOONE needs!!! <br />
<br />
He knows a lot more about AVS then you do, so listen to him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First of all, Metaballs APE has nothing to do with Winamp Pro or not. I wrote it, and I didn't get paid for it and I'm not associated with Nullsoft.<br />
<br />
Metaballs APE is known to crash on XP with Winamp5. I do not intend to release a fix for it, because:<br />
a) I'm too lazy to do the whopping task of replacing one line of code.<br />
b) It's a boring APE.<br />
<br />
The reason it works in an existing preset is because it crashes when you open the config window, which also happens when adding it to a preset. As long as you don't touch it in an existing preset, it'll work fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I totally stick with Jaak, he's right. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is your kinda shit that NOONE needs!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
It's your shit we don't need. Make an AVS for yourself, or don't make one. You can learn, you can become good, it's not that hard. But never rip somebody's stuff to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh yea... by saying that no offence to UCD's coding skills :D<br />
<br />
Its cool, but its not what avs is ment to be</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's great. If you've made it yourself. It's not cool to use things like MetaBalls or Tentacles if you haven't made 'em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you UnConed for letting me know that metaball (meatballs as I call 'em)is incompatible with win5 in xp !! It is what I needed to know ,,, Not a bunch of bullshit from troublemakers saying what I can or cannot do on my own puter. AVS is supposed to be about making presets and having fun but coming here to forums for a little HELP seems to bring out the morons that just want to cause trouble.<br />
  And as far as being payed for I meant win5 pro not your ape and I have had every winamp from 2.77 on up (cept beta) including free win5....</div></div><hr />
