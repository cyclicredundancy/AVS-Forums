      <p class="post-content"><strong>Does anyone still have my presets?</strong><br />
      Hey there AVS world, long time no see. So I guess all my presets, for some reason, have been lost in the depths of the intarnets, so I was wondering if anyone possibly might still have any of them? Because I don't have them anymore either, but I wanted to see them again, and for some reason DA deleted all of mine, and I cant find them in my old posts here either. So if anyone might possibly still have them, and could send them to me, that would be cool.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks! - pc</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah on dA not every gallery (=category) gets the same care and attention. poor avs is one of them:(<br />
      but in a community what's as large as dA it's nearly impossible (cause everybody photographing or doing fractals or drawing)</p>

      btw, i will be the first to admit my stuff isn't all techy, but i would like to see them again and perhaps make then better or something. I just rediscovered avs again and has started learning superscope a bit. I think i was like 13 - 15 when i made these presets :/<br />
      <br />
      edit: i found some old cdr's with 3 packs by a guy called DannyG that isn't in the archive. You want them? one is a remix pack, and the two other are more him playing a bit with the superscope, nothing special really. Plus a unconed single preset wich i don't think is any of his packs.</p>
