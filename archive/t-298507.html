<div class="posttext">Hey there AVS world, long time no see.  So I guess all my presets, for some reason, have been lost in the depths of the intarnets, so I was wondering if anyone possibly might still have any of them?  Because I don't have them anymore either, but I wanted to see them again, and for some reason DA deleted all of mine, and I cant find them in my old posts here either.  So if anyone might possibly still have them, and could send them to me, that would be cool. <br />
<br />
Thanks! - pc</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah DA don't really bother to keep their data very well and periodically lose large chunks of their stuff. Its all very cheapskatey of them...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah on dA not every gallery (=category) gets the same care and attention. poor avs is one of them:(<br />
but in a community what's as large as dA it's nearly impossible (cause everybody photographing or doing fractals  or drawing)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">don't worry, pixelcraft. i just received 150mb of presets and packs from dax16 (http://da16x.deviantart.com/), an impressive collection. your packs are among those and will be included in the next update of the visbot archive. just let me go sure everything is virus-free!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi! You wouldn't happen to have two of mine old packs too? Deviantart deleted two, but the last one was still there.<br />

<br />
btw, i will be the first to admit my stuff isn't all techy, but i would like to see them again and perhaps make then better or something. I just rediscovered avs again and has started learning superscope a bit. I think i was like 13 - 15 when i made these presets :/<br />
<br />
edit: i found some old cdr's with 3 packs by a guy called DannyG that isn't in the archive. You want them? one is a remix pack, and the two other are more him playing a bit with the superscope, nothing special really. Plus a unconed single preset wich i don't think is any of his packs.</div></div><hr />
