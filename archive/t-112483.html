<div class="posttext">Looks nice!<br />
<br />
for Zerocreativity... yeah, it deserves it's name. ;) <br />
Kuzukuza could use something more than only those lines - it's a quite 60's.<br />
Eventhorizon: it seems to pull lines from the top when the dot plane gets too high. Looks further ok.<br />
:up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Once I force myself to look past the dot plane eventhorizon looks really cool. <br />
<br />
I'd fade out the far end of the DM on zerocreativity a bit more though, you can still see the 'ugly textures at a distance' effect. Try replaceing 1.2+z1 with 1+z1, that looks much nicer to me.<br />
<br />
kuzukuza was perfect though, then again I do really like that type of preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">zerocreativity : I have 3d-plane-ish DM (somewhat like that preset) and it use a texture similiar to that one... crap! :p Looks nice, though...<br />
<br />
kuzu kuza : Deforming DMs on a bunch of lines =D Get rid of fadeout, and maybe it's just me, but it seem a bit empty... (but then, I never &quot;tried&quot; to do a minimalist preset)... But the lines show to deform DMs nicely, and textures that do the same thing isn't really easy to find.<br />
<br />
eventhorizon : Nice! Quite different from what you usually do ;) (Or maybe my brain is playing tricks on me again)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My fave was zero creativity. Nice and dynamic.<br />
<br />
Kuzakuza got moving a bit too fast for me at some points. It's pretty cool, but I don't think I'd watch it for an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
Event horizon was quite enjoyable.</div></div><hr />
