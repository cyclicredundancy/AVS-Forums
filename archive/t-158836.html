			<strong>AVS does not start at all!</strong><br />
		
		

		Well its like this:<br />
<br />
I've had winamp for many years now. I've been constantly upgrading it, but only the 2.x versions(never tried 3.x). Anyway, I wasnt really interested in visualizations until recently. A few months ago when I started to poke around with the visualizations, I found that AVS wouldnt work. Nullsoft Tiny Fullscreen 2001 (v2.04) and the built in visualizations(spectrum analyzer and oscilloscope) work just fine. In these months I kept upgrading hoping that the next upgrade would fix the problem but even with the latest(v2.91) the situation is hopeless.<br />
<br />
What happens is that when I select AVS in the visualizations section in the Preferences and click &quot;Start&quot;, for a fraction of a second some window with a faint border comes up and disappears. Sometimes I even see &quot;Presets&quot; and &quot;Settings&quot; in the menu, only to disappear again. When I click &quot;Configure&quot; a messagebox comes up - &quot;Advanced Visualization Stdio v2.60 .... What we at Nullsoft ... &quot; and then I click &quot;Close&quot; and nothing happens thereafter. In the Plug-ins section even if &quot;Auto execute ...&quot; is checked it makes no difference.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it could be a case of missing dll's but I'm not sure(IOW I have no clue). So I'd be pretty grateful if someone put some insight into this.

		I'll bet money it's because AVS2.6 is a piece of shit.  There's a link to the latest version - (to be) released with Winamp5 - 2.8beta1 on the main forum.  It's been crashing for me a lot tho, so you might look for the last 2.7 release, though it won't be as &quot;complete&quot; as beta1.  Good luck

		Possible solution:<br />
Close Winamp. Go to your winamp directory and open up winamp.ini.<br />
Find the line that says [AVS], below that should be 4 assignments like this:<br />
<br />
wx=347<br />
wy=36<br />
ww=350<br />
wh=232<br />
<br />
Remove them, and start Winamp/AVS again.

		That problem! I had it too some time ago too, but I don't remember how it happened, although, it have somthing to do with opening the window,  dock it in the editor and close it or something blah blah blah...<br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever, I fixed i by making a <b>BACKUP</b> of all important files in winamp (AVS presets, ect.) and then uninstall and re install it, either I recomend you try to use UnconeD's solution. :)

		Thanks for the replies everyone. I found that upgrading wasnt going to help me at all, so I did what *tey suggested: complete uninstall and then a reinstall. It worked!<br />
<br />
P.S. : Removing those assignements didnt help though, thanks UnConeD anyway.
