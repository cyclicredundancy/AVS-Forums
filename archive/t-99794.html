		Great Job! You certainly put a lot of work into the presets..<br />
<br />
The problem is that most of them are quite static...<br />
<br />
Best of all is definately Milkdrop - You used different technique in multimovement though... and I noticed that the SSC morphes from 1 shape to another...<br />
<br />
Overall : 3.5-4 stars.<br />
<br />
BTW, while we're still on your pack... Can you enlighten me on SSCs that morph to another form?

		Wow. I just got around to looking at your pack. Very nice. :up:<br />
<br />
I did find that ocean2 was quite slow unfortunately, if looks very nice though.<br />
<br />
Never did like Skittles, but taste the rainbow is awsome.<br />
<br />
Didn't care much for Bloom, or fruity for that matter. They were nice, but didn't do much for me.

		Sweet presets...Loved all of them except Milkdrop: Too basic. Just a spectrum.  Yest there is a fade, but come on!  Something more at least...<br />
<br />
Here's a quick problem I have: Did you code the Lightning bolts in Ocean2 or are they from Speeder 3k from Whacko V?  If they are, I see no props to them...(props=thankz)

		For Milkdrop, you'll have to look at it more carefully.<br />
<br />
For Ocean 2, it's not copied - It's merely a superscope which displays the spectrum which moves around and only visible on beat.

		Nice work! It must have taken days to compete ocean2!<br />
Some are a bit basic, but they all look cool to me...<br />
My (personal) ratings per preset:<br />
<br />
Exponent - A typical tunnel, no really exrta's - (XX---)2<br />
<br />
Bloom - Colourful, just like the most in the pack, the white hurts a bit in my eyes (XXX--)3<br />
<br />
BongWater - The Dmovement adds an ice little extra (XXX--)3<br />
<br />
BumblingAround - A nice rainbow in the Sscope, looks nice (XXX&gt;-)3.5<br />
<br />
Intro - What's there to say? a simple spectrum. mot really amazing... (XX---)2<br />
<br />
Fountain - Another tunnel, but this one looks better (XXX--)3<br />
<br />
Fruity - Changes the weak point in Bloom (XXX&gt;--)3.5<br />
<br />
Fruity 2 - Gets a bit boring after a while, still looks OK - (XXX--)3<br />
<br />
Lightspeed - Looks really spacy! (XXX`&lt;--)3.75<br />
<br />
Milkdrop - I like the changing scope, starts simple but twists really nice (XXX--)3<br />
<br />
Ocean2 - A real masterpiece! Indeed, it's really slow but looks REALLY :cool:  realistic. I wonmder what the first one looked like? (XXXX&gt;)4.5<br />
<br />
Rottobounce - A simple scope... not much different than the others. (XX---)2<br />
<br />
Taste the rainbow - Colourfull, just as the name indicates (XXX--)<br />
<br />
Trip - Don't know what to think of it... Special, yes, but... a bit weird.. Suppose that's the whole idea ((XXX--)3<br />
<br />
Tunneling - Yes, another tunnel... an orange one this time... (X`&lt;---)1.75 :cry: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These are my personal ratings. If you don't agree, that's just a different kind of taste... <br />
<br />
