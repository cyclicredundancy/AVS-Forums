      It seems I am the first one to release a avs-game. The goal is to hit the green bar on the left side of the screen. You can control your 'bat' (the white bar) with the mouse. When you miss the ball, it'll the red bar behind you and you lose a point and if you have no points, a live. When you've scored 10 points, you go up a level. This means the ball will be faster.<br />
      <br />
      The preset was made for 64 fps. If it's faster on your computer, you can change the ball's speed by adjusting the framerate slider in the display settings or you can change the spdo variable in the init of the first scope.<br />
      <br />
      The required slkscr.ttf font and skupers_cb_gameover.bmp bitmap are included in the zipfile.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Took me a while to figure out how to control it. Why not simply follow the mouse all the time? Having to hold down the button is annoying.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      By the way, this implementation is a bit silly... the goal of pong is to track the ball with a pad that moves slowly. If you link the position of the pad with the mouse, it all comes down to reponse time rather than anticipating the ball.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and using gettime() you can make your game FPS-independent.</p>

        why are you using winamp3 in the first place?
      </blockquote>I think you'll find that it's what's advertised on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com" target="_blank">winamp.com</a> main page. Note the rather prominent image saying (and I quote exactly) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/images/themes/modern/getwinamp3_left.gif" target="_blank">"Download WINAMP3 now!"</a>.<br />
      <br />
      The disadvantage of having your versions numbered like Winamp has (3, 2, 5, in that order. WTF?) is that it's kinda confusing to newbies. :igor:

      <p class="post-content">Not like 3-2-5.<br />
      WA( :winamp: ) started as 1, years ago. Then came 2 and later 3, but that sucked major arse so Nullsoft 'mixed' 2 and 3 (2+3=5) and came up with WA5. (Or as I believe 4 was abandoned in pre-alpha or beta stage and they went on with 5 :igor: ).<br />
      And besides, I doubt that many visitors of this particulary forum will visit the mainpage often. We know most of the news already before publishing and if not, important news spreads fast enough...<br />
      And as WA3 is concerned, it's {still} the newest thing around since WA5 is still unreleased (not regarding newer WA2 updates).<br />
      <br />
      But I guess this is already said many times around all forums</p>

      <p class="post-content">a little 'bug'. Speed is only determined on the X-axis. If you give the ball a lot of effect, it's nearly impossible to get your paddle there where you want because the vertical movement is just too large to follow.<br />
      <br />
      I also got some weird stuff when the ball hit my paddle real fast. it seemed to be 'sticking' to my paddle for a while.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, my highscore is 41 now :D<br />
      <br />
      @FSK: That's just like the original Pong and shouldn't be changed, although it's annoying, but that's my opinion</p>

      </blockquote>I thought that would be more exciting. Well, at least more exciting than having the ball resetted to the middle of the screen everytime you make a mistake.<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>I know of this bug. It's because hitting the bat is determined when the the ball is between 0.9-0.5*spd and 0.9+0.5*spd . If you move really fast you can trap it from the sides. I thought that this would almost never happen, but since you noticed, I'll change the code to prevent this. Would you rather have the ball continue in that case or have it bounce off the side?<br />
      <br />
      I was also thinking of doing tetris, but I'm still wondering what the best way is to store the information of what blocks are already placed. The best idea seemed to me to store every row as a 10-digit 'binary' number. It's not really binary, but a decimal number with only 0's and 1's. 1111111110 would stand for an almost entirely filled row, with only the most right one not used. The problem with this technique is that reading and storing the information to 10 rows x 10 blocks = 100 blocks would take at least 100 equations and 100 variables per frame. Do you think there's a better way?

      <p class="post-content">hmm.. another bug I found is that the ball is *pretty* easy to make move only on x-axis (well, it moves very slightly on y-axis) nothing big but just makes things boring (like it isn't already, sorry :D ) (I played to lvl 9 before decided to drop off)<br />
      <br />
      lol, tetris.. I was a serious tetris-freak ya know :DDD<br />

      anways. Nice effort with the new things of AVS. GJ :up:</p>
