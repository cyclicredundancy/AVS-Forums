<div class="posttext">I'm sorry but I do not understand what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
You are trying to &quot;add an option&quot; for AVS? What do you mean by option? <br />
Are you attempting to develop an AVS component? <br />
Or are you just trying to get the title of the song to display in the AVS for each AVS transition?<br />
<br />
I'm confused. Can you try and reword this a bit?<br />
<br />
If the latter, then the only thing that I know of that can be done with AVS text is to check/uncheck one of these 2 options for text, in the AVS Editor (to open Editor, double-click anywhere within AVS window)...<br />
<br />
1. AVS Editor &gt; Display &gt; Windowed Settings...<br />
a) check/uncheck Suppress status text in windowed<br />
b) check/uncheck Suppress title text in windowed<br />
 <br />
2. AVS Editor &gt; Display &gt; Fullscreen Settings...<br />
a) check/uncheck Suppress status text in fullscreen<br />
b) check/uncheck Suppress title text in fullscreen</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are you are talking about adding custom text messages like you can in MilkDrop (http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=62202)?   Sorry, the answer is no. :(<br />
You can use MilkDrop with Winamp 3 if you download install the Classic Vis. Component (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=122130).  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">he wants to use the current playing song name as a variable in the avs text render effect, like 'blah %currentsong% blah'<br />
<br />
that's impossible, but the current song is already announced on the avs screen, you just can't control it's appearance</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Moved to the AVS forums. It is just confusing these good folks in WA3 TS. :)<br />
<br />
What do you mean by appearance? You cannot do too much (nything)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can't access data like currently playing song or it's length at all in AVS, even through APEs.  This has been brought up in the AVS wishlist a couple times, and will (hopefully) be added if and when AVS is ever updated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Assuming that the person watching your song doesn't have suppress title text checked you can use DM's and such to move the text around.  It acts just like any other text put onto the screen, so you can add more effects that will change it.  However, you can't use the render/text to do it though, and the text only appears for a few seconds at the beginning of each song.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">not to mention the fact that it doesn't actually render on the avs window until it stops saying the name</div></div><hr />
