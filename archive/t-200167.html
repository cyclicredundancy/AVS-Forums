		someone know how reader/trinagle work.<br />
I was seeing the preset &quot;R0x0r my B0x0rz&quot; maded by unconed i find on da <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11779300/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11779300/</a><br />
and i just change some formala without knowing what do. I just write some know what it do but i got the result very cool like some .swf i used sometime for mix. It seem very cool. There are some more presets more simple than this one (i never undestand megabuf) to undestand how work like just one triangle maybe moving. The only thing i undestand<br />
gx are nuber of cube x circle and gy are the number of circle in this preset.<br />
i attach the preset i make modifing &quot;R0x0r my B0x0rz&quot; my favourite is triangle4

		UnConeD thanx for replay. i know i m not good i coding. but this is a thing i found very interesting for future of avs. look at  <a href="http://www.otolab.net/" target="_blank">http://www.otolab.net/</a> this is stuff i like. I write that i just write some casual formulas. i download all your preset and must say always you do very good avs and you are the master of coding.  But anyway i study video arts and graphic and i perform in some places i will not write here and must say coding it's realy important and this presets i do it's a work of UnConeD for programming . I'm not a master of avs I usualy to do my stuff in &quot;flash&quot;, &quot;director&quot; and &quot;max msp&quot; and bulding my own sensors using keyboard cip and using iron piece for map the cips <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/11339229/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/view/11339229/</a> but i'm always iterested to all the free programs. I never like aol expecialy now there is no Justin. But i must to say coding it's not all for make a good visual you can use only a live camera and good ........

		Coding isn't what's most important in AVS, yes, but were not here to talk about that.<br />
<br />
So what you basicly did was to surf around, find the coolest preset done so far and then just &quot;tweak&quot; it to look &quot;cool&quot;. Right, why don't you just spit him in the face next time?<br />
<br />
People use a lot of time to make presets, so when someone comes and spends five minutes adding random numbers to a highly complicated preset, it's bound to piss off the artist atleast.<br />
<br />
AVS is like any other thing, you can't just come in and start messign around with other people's work and post it. Maybe for your own personal amusement, but  just don't post it. We don't do it to your flash work. Why should you do it to our presets?

		yea i know how many haurs of works there are for make a preset expecialy for coding hard. I just only say thre are very good possibility whit triangles i hope to not be offensive and i say it before.<br />
I know UnConed, you Togummi, El-vis and many other avs maker work without money just for make a good visual and they work FOR OUR PLEASURE.<br />
gREAT tHANK<br />
eXPECIALY I MUST TO SAY great great THANK To UnConed he replay me always.<br />
 Lately i see soo many presets look similar but i'm not able to do better. this message it's only a suggest for discover unknow area of avs and i think you will sure make realy good presets with triangles. The anoteher thing i poast this message it's because i never use presets of another people for mix and i will be happy to learn about triangle. Sorry i know thre are many days for make realy good thing (expecialy for make good presets) in evry work but satisfaction to see the thing you make in own your hand you will give more and more.<br />
sorry for bad english<br />
bye marco
