      <p class="post-content"><strong>Custom moving particles</strong><br />
      Hey guys, I got this idea from one of (I think it was) Tuggummi's presets. Basically he created moving particles using superscopes. Not too advanced of an idea, but I like it because it gives you control of the particle.<br />
      Anyways... I'm trying ot replicate what he did, but am having one problem. As long as I clear every frame, everything looks fine, but if I don't, I sometimes get a washout effect of whatever color the particle is. I think that this has something to do with the dynamic shift, but I am not sure.<br />
      Anyways, if anyone can help me with this, I would appreciate it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">With "washout effect" you mean that the whole screen becomes white, right?<br />
      Well, first of all it has to do with the movement r=0. Cause this sets all lines running from the middle to the border of the screen, like that what is drawn from the middle upwards.<br />
      (hope you are a bit familiar with polar coordinates and understand this, if not feel free to ask again)<br />
      <br />
      Now, if this line is completly white (from the middle till the border of the screen) the whole screen becomes white.<br />
      As long as "clear every frame" is disabled, the next frame will be rendered upon the last. So when the ball is moved to the upper middle by the dyn-shift and is big enough, the whole screen becomes white as soon as the old frame passes the r=0 movement.</p>
