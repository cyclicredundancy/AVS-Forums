      <p class="post-content"><strong>3+ colour gradient in SSC - how to?</strong><br />
      I am basically trying to create the standard, VERY boring led-style spectrum with red at y=1, yellow at y=0 and yup, green at y=-1.<br />
      <br />
      I've noticed some gradients use circular/Pi progression, some sin/cos varients and others that I need to go back to school to remember! :P (Oi, just turned 32, mind failing and getting grumpier at teenagers!) :D<br />
      <br />
      If there is someone that can show a nice and simple way of doing this, I'd be much grateful.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers and ty.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and am I right in believing that d is a stencilling/alpha operand? :s</p>

      Helps very muchly. I didn't even think of above(), below() - still getting used to this side of programming. (I am *much* better with hex-editors and decompilers!;))<br />
      <br />
      The first place I went to was the tutes links, but not for lack of trying, I couldn't get what I was after. I ended up with this basic gradient which blends them very nicely when used in conjuction with vert move and fade:<br />
      <br />
      red=1-y;<br />
      green=1+y;<br />
      blue=0;<br />
      <br />
      Thank you again.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeh, I read the threads on that. :|<br />
      <br />
      Whether it's a good thing or bad is up to be seen. Could just make a mess of things like all the versions of html out there. Hope not.<br />

      <p class="post-content">thats just bullshit, AVS is open source, but absolutely no work has been done on it. From the other end, if we start working on it, we will keep it compatible with old presets, otherways there would be no point on working on it, would there?</p>

      Although it may get messy if pple start working on the open source, I still like it as is as it gives me another interest on the comp (including the other 200 that are sitting idle! ;))<br />
      <br />
      Being a gfx nut, I can use the effects in renders and the like.<br />
      <br />
      And as for new effects etc., there's always these forums to help - (*whine* How do I make a great avs with moving particle and the new render 'ultrascope' etc. [grin])<br />
      <br />
      Cheers<br />
