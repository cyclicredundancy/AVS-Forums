<div class="posttext">The adress for avs king's presets are right there (http://avs-king.deviantart.com/gallery/visualization/?view=1&amp;order=5&amp;limit=24). Not sure why it &quot;doesn't seem to work.&quot; Do you mean they won't download, or that you can't find them at all, or once downloaded they don't work? I assume you mean The download won't work. If that is the case, I will be happy to send you any avs king presets I have, although you will have to wait. I won't be able to get to it until Tuesday and I have to download them myself. I used to have a bunch of his stuff, but with all the WA and AVS reinstalls I've done, I don't seem to have them now. Anyway, if no one else helps you by then, I will send them. So...you're saying your addy is shodan@hotmail.com?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well your correct when i click on the download link it says file not found and my emaill address is swingler_richard@hotmail.com however i would like you to make sure that you send me as many as possible and if you can you could ask other people to help as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd July 2005, 17:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Other people will not be quick to jump on that sort of help. the presets are easy to find, so the issue is with your comp, and nobody has any tolerance for that.:D<br />
<br />
I will send you all that can be found easily; should be quite a few.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the issue is that deviantart lost most of its deviations a couple of years ago. being gallery director i reuploaded some of the packs, but not all. post the missing packs from avsking here and i will fix that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shodan</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th July 2005, 05:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">what's going on? i thought beeferoni was going to send me some of avs-kings avs presets this tuesday and now it's thursday 4.08 pm and i'm still waiting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th July 2005, 08:16</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, I certainly don't think I have any of the missing packs from avs-king. If anyone does, Please post them.<br />
<br />
shodan, have patience. I got back later than expected; I am in the process of downloading what avs-king presets I can find. :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">kauahagga</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th July 2005, 05:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Are Focus4 and focus5 packs missing......if they are then ihave them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th July 2005, 03:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">oh avs-king=david?<br />
i have focus 1-5 here<br />
<br />
yathosho, tell me which ones you need, i'll send them to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th July 2005, 19:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">See, shodan, you would be better off asking TomyLobo for those presets; He already has them. I on the other hand have been very busy lately and still haven't had time to dl any of them. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shodan</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 02:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that's not the point i've got focus 1-5 what i need is the single avs presets that avs-king had in his gallery at deviantart</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 03:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i'll just post em here<br />
a file search for *.avs containing 'bmp' resulted only in one preset, which needed that one .bmp file which i also included.<br />
if any other images are needed, just post here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 03:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">and there go focus 4 and 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shodan</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 05:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">what's going on i just said that i need his SINGLE avs presets not his pack's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 15:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, you can just take it or leave it. Cause as yatosho said, AVS-king's presets are no longer available for DL. That means if no one has those 'Single'-Presets on his or her machine no one can actually post them here!<br />
Also yatosho asked the people to post all missing AVS-king-stuff here, so he can re-upload it...<br />
<br />
Just don't lose patience, perhaps someone will come along and post the singles the next few days?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 17:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or shodan could just find the &quot;singles&quot; he's looking for...:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Yathosho</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 19:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">nobody with the original installers? otherwise i will pimp them up myself before i upload them. will talk to avsking on aim to get an ok on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 21:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">sorry, i don't have any original AVS-King isntallers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th July 2005, 03:41</div></div>
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">can somebody please get hold of avs-king an ask hinm to reload his SINGLE avs prests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th July 2005, 21:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jeez, that might be expecting a bit too much. You posted this question and quite a few people bent over backwards to accomadate you. If it isn't exactly what you want, I suggest you e-mail avs-king yourself. Even then, it isn't likely David is going to seperate those presets for you. You will have to dl the packs and edit them, just as the rest of us do.;)</div></div><hr />
