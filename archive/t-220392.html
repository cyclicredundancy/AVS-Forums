		The adress for avs king's presets are right <a href="http://avs-king.deviantart.com/gallery/visualization/?view=1&amp;order=5&amp;limit=24" target="_blank">there</a>. Not sure why it &quot;doesn't seem to work.&quot; Do you mean they won't download, or that you can't find them at all, or once downloaded they don't work? I assume you mean The download won't work. If that is the case, I will be happy to send you any avs king presets I have, although you will have to wait. I won't be able to get to it until Tuesday and I have to download them myself. I used to have a bunch of his stuff, but with all the WA and AVS reinstalls I've done, I don't seem to have them now. Anyway, if no one else helps you by then, I will send them. So...you're saying your addy is <a href="mailto:shodan@hotmail.com">shodan@hotmail.com</a>?

		Other people will not be quick to jump on that sort of help. the presets are easy to find, so the issue is with your comp, and nobody has any tolerance for that.:D<br />
<br />
I will send you all that can be found easily; should be quite a few.

		See, shodan, you would be better off asking TomyLobo for those presets; He already has them. I on the other hand have been very busy lately and still haven't had time to dl any of them. ;)

		Well, you can just take it or leave it. Cause as yatosho said, AVS-king's presets are no longer available for DL. That means if no one has those 'Single'-Presets on his or her machine no one can actually post them here!<br />
Also yatosho asked the people to post all missing AVS-king-stuff here, so he can re-upload it...<br />
<br />
Just don't lose patience, perhaps someone will come along and post the singles the next few days?!

		Jeez, that might be expecting a bit too much. You posted this question and quite a few people bent over backwards to accomadate you. If it isn't exactly what you want, I suggest you e-mail avs-king yourself. Even then, it isn't likely David is going to seperate those presets for you. You will have to dl the packs and edit them, just as the rest of us do.;)
