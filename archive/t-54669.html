<br />
AVS do not use your VOODOO because AVS do not use OPENGL. SPEED of AVS depends only from sped of CPU and no mether what video card you have it will run with same speed.<br />

<div class="posttext">True, that's why my AVS runs smoothly only in a 5cm * 3cm window :D:D:D:D (celeron 300A)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, it doesn't need a video card to run, I suppose, but it does need one to show up on the monitor. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It runs equally on my ati mach 64 and my 3d prophet II mx.. No change in performance whatsoever.<br />
<br />
 I just wish it would get more out of my athlon 850. I want to try to set up a clean boot. So it loads only what I need when I want to run AVS. Just to milk the most out of the processor, but that's still in the works.<br />
<br />
 Anyone ever heard of two grphics cards in one system? Just an odd question i've had in my mind..</div></div><hr />

Many computers have the option to select between a PCI or AGP video card.  I'm not sure where you select it...maybe in the bios or something.  Also, with motherboards with onboard video, you can select between the provided video or a PCI video card I believe.  So the answer is yes...you can have 2 but you can only run one at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
  My goal is to get my 3dprophetII 32 and my ATI Mach 64 both in the system and be able to select which one I use. This is because I have tv\s-video) out on the ATI, but not on the 3d prophet..<br />
<br />
 Switching them in and out is annoying, anyone have any specifics?<br />
<br />
 I'm running an Asus A7v motherboard with windows 98..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok. yes, video card to run. but not allow 3d graphics. even with EL_VIS' stuff :D</div></div><hr />

Remember, if you have 2 cards that are both AGP, then you are SOL.  You can only choose which one you want to work if one is AGP and one is PCI.  If this isn't your case, then you won't be able to switch the cards without doing so physically because motherboards don't have 2 AGP slots (unless your's does...I doubt it).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have a Savage 2000 card with TV-out.  A word of warning...I don't know how your card is with TV-out, but mine doesn't allow you to go any higher than 640X400 resolution when it is in TV-out mode.  Maybe yours does but mine doesn't.  Either it's a shitty card, or....it's a shitty card.  I don't know.  Just be wary of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, My ATI MAch64 is PCI and the 3dProphetII is AGP, can I just plunk them both in and select one when windows bots or do i have to set up different boots? <br />
<br />
 I really have no clue as t6o the how-to part of running them both(not at the same time, but not having to swap one out and one in) Is it as simple as selecting which hardware to use in the system tab of the control panel, or more complicated? <br />
<br />
 The Mach 64 can handle some better resolutions, but it's not really all that impoirtant for the moment since I'm only able to really get the visualisations going around 400x300 at any decent speed(it's got to beat-match fairly well (I've figured out that 20fps is about the slowest I want)<br />
<br />
 I'd just like to try it out and see what comes of it.. I have the two cards, and an athlon 850, why not?<br />
<br />
 If anyone has any more info I'd appreciate it!</div></div><hr />
