      <p class="post-content">Hmm lets see.<br />
      Microsofts current OS Vista imho is just a re-vamped XP with a more stable 64 bit file system.<br />
      <br />
      Xp was crap when it first came out and still is crap.<br />
      <br />
      Millenium was total crap.<br />
      ME was decent and had a good start.<br />
      2000 was almost as good as 98<br />
      98se was nothing mroe then a glorified patch to 98.<br />
      98 imho is still better then xp and vista combined.<br />
      95 was on the good path and gave birth to 98.<br />
      3 was actually imho better then vista could ever be.<br />
      <br />
      all in all vista has to get some better surrport before i change my ways with 98.<br />
      <br />
      oh some good news for a small 30 bucks i got a nice amd athloon 1800+,MSI-MS-6330 K7T Turbo2 pc with box and power supply. now i'll be capable of making those cpu intensive avs's i've been wanting for so long.<br />
      <br />
      Drools from the excitement.<br />
      sorry if that last bit was off topic.</p>
