<div class="posttext">Hmm lets see.<br />
Microsofts current OS Vista imho is just a re-vamped XP with a more stable 64 bit file system.<br />
<br />
Xp was crap when it first came out and still is crap.<br />
<br />
Millenium was total crap.<br />
ME was decent and had a good start.<br />
2000 was almost as good as 98<br />
98se was nothing mroe then a glorified patch to 98.<br />
98 imho is still better then xp and vista combined.<br />
95 was on the good path and gave birth to 98.<br />
3 was actually imho better then vista could ever be.<br />
<br />
all in all vista has to get some better surrport before i change my ways with 98.<br />
<br />
oh some good news for a small 30 bucks i got a nice amd athloon 1800+,MSI-MS-6330 K7T Turbo2 pc with box and power supply. now i'll be capable of making those cpu intensive avs's i've been wanting for so long.<br />
<br />
Drools from the excitement.<br />
sorry if that last bit was off topic.</div></div><hr />
