<div class="posttext">You call that a review?  Pfft.  Here's a real review.:p <br />
<br />
Galaxy - Bit on the slow side.  I would move everything out of the main EL and check clear every frame in main(slight speed boost).  Also, in your DMs, instead of dividing by 2, multiply by .5 - multiplication is faster than division.  Some of the stuff in there doesn't make a huge difference in the preset, and mainly just bogs it down.  For example, disabling at least one of the trans/water 's hardly makes a difference in the overall effect and speeds the preset up a good bit.<br />
hypno v3 - Nice, except for the &quot;warped edges&quot;, where the DM all of a sudden goes from being nice and curvy to completely straight.  You can fix that by zooming in a little bit.  Changing the output mode of the colormap also gets some cool results(I liked minimum the most).<br />
kaleidoscope v2 - Replace/Replace ELs do nothing but suck FPS(not much of a change in FPS, but they're still pointless, IMO).  Just take everything out of it, and then delete the EL.  The preset is kinda weird - not really a kaleidoscope, and the colors are too grey.  Not real bad, but it doesn't tickle my fancy.<br />
loveparade v2 - You forgot to include the picture in your pack(or it's not in the right place).  Can't really say much, since it's not complete.  It's kinda boring without the pictures.<br />
lr - What's with the double-nested ignore/replace ELs?  That's just a FPS sucker.  It's alright, but the text and stuff is kinda weird.<br />
reality - Once again, the Replace/Replace EL.  Not everything is necessary to get the basic effect, and the FPS could definitely increase.  Not a bad preset though.<br />
square dance v2 - Very nice.  Lovely effect, but it makes my eyes go crazy every now and then.:p <br />
submarine - Ugh.  Text is pretty nasty, and the MPs kill the preset for me.  Very boring.<br />
tunel - Nice and simplified, but the warped edges aren't that great, and the title needs to be spelled right(tunnel).:p <br />
<br />
Overall: 3.0.  Not bad, but could use some improvements.  You're getting better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They weren't working for me, cuz I'm using winamp3 right now.<br />
<br />
Now that I can properly review that preset:<br />
<br />
It's not terrific - the pictures make it hard to read the text.  That's an okay effect with the text, but a bit boring.</div></div><hr />
