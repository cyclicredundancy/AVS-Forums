      <p class="post-content">This preset doesn't really take advantage of avspre3's tools. I suggest you learn some more coding (superscope, dynamic movement, etc..) and also learn some more of what avspre3 is capable of (global vars, extended variable limit, colormod, etc...).</p>

      <p class="post-content">What the fuck? The forums aint good for me? I'm not the one who spams it full with annoying questions. I even made you a fucking remix and you start fucking around. Sorry if I was mistaken by your ranks, though you can't deny your postpumping.<br />
      <br />
      And to the mods, this is not to start a flame-war, this just plainly pisses me off.</p>
