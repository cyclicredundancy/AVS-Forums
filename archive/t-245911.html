		I did this one as an exercise in learning. I think it's damn funny, fairly realistic lip syncing. :-)<br />
<br />
I'm including another recent preset, what looks like 10 goldfish or guppies swimming in a circle around a rotating star, so i'm calling it Starfish. Good music response too.<br />
<br />
Any critiques or suggestions would be a great aid to my learning process.

		It's cool and original. <br />
<br />
Try and not show us all the presets and do a pack beacasue if we know what presets there will be in the pack we won't bother downloading it. <br />
<br />
Otherwise great work.

I suppose you right, but you know how it is with beginners, they think they've created the greatest preset ever, and just have to show it to someone. :-)<br />
<br />
I'll try to hold off until i get enough worthy for a pack. What is the average size of a beginner pack, 10, 15, 20 ?<br />
<br />
Of course, waiting until i have a pack, i'll lose out on the feedback, which encourages me to improve. :-(
