		First, you need to start with a good base - starfields and dot grid's don't always work, and they don't work in these presets.  Then you need to have some nice effects and or interesting DM's, etc.  The DM's that you have are some of the weirdest I have ever seen.  When you make a DM, you need to know what you are trying to create before you make it, and then make it according to your &quot;vision&quot;, changing things as is necessary to make it better.

		I realize that I need some &quot;nice effects&quot; and &quot;interesting dm's&quot;...what I don't realize is how to go about doing it...I've read the avs manual already...maybe I should read it again....

		There's atero's primer, which will be out soon.  You can check the different tips and tricks threads in this forums, as well as the website thread which has a good bit of articles.<br />
<br />
What effects and DM's you use is dependent upon what you are trying to make - most good presets are begun with an idea which is then implemented using AVS.

			<strong>hmmm....</strong><br />
		
		

		I wish you weren't so vague...Atero's Primer has been out for awhile unless you meant a new version is due to be out soon...how would I go about &quot;implementing&quot; flames that dance to the beat of the music?..

		I can't be specific when you aren't giving me anything specific(you're getting a little more specific now, though) - I could tell you one way to make each of these presets better, but there are thousands of ways.  Atero is making a new primer that will hopefully be a lot nicer.<br />
<br />
To implement flames, you can use several different methods.  The best way to get flames that dance to the music would be using a DM.  The hard part is figuring out the code to do that.  Unfortunately, I am not that great at making DM's(I like SSC's much more).  You could also do it using a SSC, but that would require a lot of points to look good(a nice texer would probably help a lot with that too).

		Yeah...that coding looks tough....I've been dinking around with it a little...thanks for your help...I really want you to know that I do appreciate your help...I've been having a stressful day...and then trying to make a decent preset didn't make it go any better...thanks again }= )-~
