      <p class="post-content"><strong>Tips&amp;Tricks in AVS</strong><br />
      As i have made avs for 2 years now, i really don't know much about how to do things differently.<br />
      <br />
      Confused?<br />
      Read more.<br />
      <br />
      As <b>A</b>dvanced <b>V</b>isualization <b>S</b>tudio is a highly customizable visualization plugin/component there are usually many ways to do simple things. And when it comes to coding your own superscopes and dynamic movements there are several different ways to make things, like in the dynamic movement using rectangular coordinates rather than polar coordinates to create the exactly same effect.<br />
      <br />
      Sometimes if you do things differently you may gain some priviledges, like better frame rates or the benefits of using a different coordinate system. Also when you use the built-in functions differently you may get faster&amp;better results than doing the same thing with different effects.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <b><u><font size="2">EXAMPLE</font></u></b><br />
      Creating a rotoblitter effect in movement with both polar- &amp; rectangular coordinates.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <u>Polar</u><br />
      r=r+0.1<br />
      <br />
      BENEFITS:<br />
      Simple, easy and a fast way.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <u>Rectangular</u><br />
      x=x+y*0.1 ;<br />
      y=y-x*0.1<br />
      <br />
      BENEFITS:<br />
      You can shift it around the screen which can't be done in polar coordinates.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      These helpful speed up tricks and better quality tips are scattered all over the forum, so what im asking here is to collect all those helpful notes into a single forum post, <u>this post.</u><br />
      <br />
      So feel free to post your ideas and comments how something that is frequently used can be done faster&amp;better, this is all for the common good and will surely help us all as we are always searching a alternative way to make presets.<br />
      <br />
      And please remember that, althought the most tips consider coding there is still many different ways to use the built-in effects differently and still get the same effect. If you have discovered a clever way of using <u>example:</u> <i>Trans / Water</i> , you can post it here so it will help other avs artists as well.<br />
      <br />
      Hope you all understanded the point of this post and hope that you all contribute as much as you can ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Bilinear is interpolation linearly in 2D... like zooming on a picture, but instead of blocky pixels you get a blurry, smooth texture.<br />
      <br />
      Trilinear is interpolation linearly in 3D. It's commonly used to interpolate bilinearly between textures and linearly between an MIP-maps on a 3D card.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What i would like to know is: What is the fastest way to create a fullscreen gradient? I have used this method:<br />
      <br />
      1 single ssc line<br />
      <br />
      INIT: n=2<br />
      PER POINT: x=i*2-1 ; y=1<br />
      <br />
      1 movement with rect coords (bilinear filtering on)<br />
      y=y-0.0x<br />
      <br />
      It could also be done by using a gradient line and then using a movement with x=0.<br />
      <br />
      Which way is faster? Or is there even a faster way to do it?<br />
      <br />

      Im not sure how the conical gradient is done, but i guess it's just using the r=0 movement and then using a color code in a superscope like col=sin(i*pi). I don't have avs right now so i can't check did i get those other two right, so ill edit this post tomorrow (at 8:XXam gmt +2).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well yes you can use just one superscope, but to fill the entire screen with just one superscope requires a big numpoint number and the bigger the resolution the more numpoints and more slower it is. With the scope and the movement technique the numpoint number always stays the same and still the whole screen gets filled with the gradient.<br />
      <br />
      There for the movement and ssc technique is a lot faster than using one BIG ssc.</p>

      <br />
      Note : "v" stands for variable (Replace with something), and it will be number-tagged. Red/green/blue is to be coded yourself.<br />
      <br />
      Vertical, Horizontal, and Radial gradients already mentioned. Remember, you can always use another D/M to morph the gradient into one desired.<br />
      <br />
      Fullscreen Gradients :<br />
      <br />
      Horizontal gradient (Colors cycling left-right) :<br />
      <br />
      x=-1+i*2;<br />
      v1=bnot(v1) OR v1=1-v1<br />
      y=v1*2-1;<br />
      <br />
      Vertical : Exchange x and y.<br />
      <br />
      Polar : You'll need dot-grid and colorcode it... Too slow.<br />
      <br />
      -You can combine Hor. and Ver. Gradients to make combinations. Experiment with render modes.<br />
      <br />
      Cheap fullscreen combo gradient :<br />
      <br />
      Use 2 lines, perpendicular, use a good linewidth (30-50 should do it), then use a movement to fill the screen. (Technique from several of UnConeD's presets) (Is it copyrighted? :p)<br />
      <br />
      Dot-Grid :<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=83695" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....threadid=83695</a> - But I'll post the code here for convenience. The one here have edited variables to signify the new variables.<br />
      <br />
      FRAME :<br />
      <br />
      v1=w+1; v2=h+1; n=v1*v2; v3=0; v4=0; v5=1/ww; v6=1/hh;<br />
      <br />
      POINT :<br />
      <br />
      x=v3*v5*2-1; y=v4*v6*2-1;<br />
      <br />
      v3=if(above(v3+1,v1),0,v3+1);<br />
      v4=if(v3,v4,v4+1);<br />
      <br />
      --<br />
      <br />
      But of course, that will be goddamn slow. You can always reduce the amount of points and manipulate the size to conform with the screen.<br />
      In colorcoding, use x and y, i won't work well. Additional tips are in the original page.<br />
      <br />
      Examples : El-Vis - I Cannot Dance, Carry Me Home, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, and some others.<br />
      <br />
      It's quite slow, but is the most versatile, providing you use the right effects. You can also use convolution filter to make the pixels bigger and make a pixel-doubled effect.<br />
      <br />
      --<br />
      <br />
      All I can think for now... I think there are more ways...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here are some code tips for you. :)<br />
      <br />
      Optimise everything. Higher FPS makes your presets a lot nicer. Here are some examples:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      3D transformation<br />
      <br />
      x=x1/z1;<br />
      y=y1/z1;<br />
      <br />
      can be made faster by using:<br />
      <br />
      z1=1/z1;<br />
      x=x1*z1;<br />
      y=y1*z1;<br />
      <br />
      using trig in conjunction with a timer can be made faster too:<br />
      <br />
      on beat:<br />
      <br />
      drx=0.2*getosc(0.2,0.2,0);<br />
      <br />
      per frame:<br />
      <br />
      rx=rx+drx;crx=cos(rx);<br />
      <br />
      per pixel:<br />
      <br />
      x=crx;<br />
      y=0;<br />
      <br />
      Using this sort of thing a lot can make your code faster. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">3D transformation is:<br />
      Xp=Xc/Zc;<br />
      Yp=Yc/Zc;<br />
      where Xc (x-coordinate) and Yc are any numbers, positive or negative, and Zc is positive.<br />
      For a 3D object centered at the origin (0,0,0), use this formula:<br />
      Xp=Xc/(Zc+sqrt(mD));<br />
      Yp=Yc/(Zc+sqrt(mD));<br />
      where mD (maximum distance) is the largest distance from the origin to a point on the object.<br />
      <br />
      Rotation around any point, line, plane, solid, etc:<br />
      Ar=Ac*sin(theta)+Bc*cos(theta);<br />
      Br=Ac*cos(theta)-Bc*sin(theta);<br />
      where A and B are the axes defining the plane perpendicular to the axial point/line/plane/solid etc. To find the perpendicular plane, simply use the 2 axes you do <i>not</i> use to define the axial object.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a kind of a problem, I have used a static background/texture for a movement with bunch of effects. I have made it by putting all the effects inside a effectlist with ignore/replace and on beat active 1 frame. Then i have used a custom bpm set to 30bpm and put both of them inside another effect list with ignore/replace. It now takes about 1-3 seconds to start, but the fps is much higher since it doesn't have to render the texture all the time. This solution works fine, but what im asking is: Is there a even better way doing this? If you use avs effects to create a static background is there a way to only "render" it once? Or how i activate it right at the begin of a song?<br />

      Here is a wonderful guide to AVS written by El-vis that was posted a while ago. It gives code to create a superscope in 3D, rotate in along and move it along the x, y, and z axis (what's the spelling for the plural of axis?)</p>

      <br />
      init: zs=sqrt(... *)<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      rx=rx+drx; ry=ry+dry; rz=rz+drz; cx=cos(x); sx=sin(x); cy=cos(y); sy=sin(y); cz=cos(z); sz=sin(z);<br />

      x=x3*z3; y=y3*z3;<br />
      <br />
      * This should be the maximum distance from the center to a point on your scope, multiplied by 2. For a unit sphere, use the radius of the sphere multiplied by 2.<br />
      <br />
      ** x1, y1, and z1 are the coordinates for your shape, and should be put here.<br />
      <br />
      rx, ry, and rz are the angles of rotation around the x, y, and z axes, respectively. These angles are in radians (one radian = 180/pi degrees)<br />
      A good place to define these values is in the beat section of the scope, e.g.:<br />
      rx=rand(100)/1000-0.05; ry=rand(100)/1000-0.05; rz=rand(100)/1000-0.05;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Dear Degnic...<br />
      <br />
      1) Are you talking to everyone who has replied to this forum or to one person and if, who?<br />
      <br />
      2) The faster the presets run the more enjoyable they are, besides it's more than just <b>0.&lt;insert ridiculous large ammount of zeros&gt;1</b> frames, example the gradients work a lot faster when you use different methods. And the static texture for a 3D movement or likes saves up huge ammount of fps if it is only rendered once per N beats. I made a preset with the static texture and the framerate difference between render-per-N-beat and render-all-the-time is incredibly huge, on my 266mhz pentium it was about 8 fps.<br />
      <br />
      3) Everything &amp; Anything can &amp; should be optimized. Or do you draw a static single colored ssc line with 800 numpoints when just 2 will do?<br />
      <br />
      4) Last, but not least, this thread was about people sharing their ways of doing things. Someone have might used some method for months/years never knowing that it could be done better&amp;faster.<br />
      <br />
      If you don't like people giving you helpful advice, buzz off. But by the looks, you are the one who should seriously learn how to do things faster.<br />
      <br />
      Have a nice day.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is a trick that can save more than 100% fps.<br />
      When you need more sinchronised scopes shaped the same you can make a counter and copy this scope to several locations.<br />
      Example:<br />
      <br />
      init:<br />
      n=500<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      t=t-0.05;u=0;<br />
      <br />
      point:<br />
      u=u+1;u1=u%5;<br />
      d=i/5;r=t+i*3.14159*4;x=cos(r)*d;y=sin(r)*d+(u1+0.5)/5*2-1;<br />
      <br />
      This will create 1 spiral scope and place it at u1/5*2-1 locations, u is a counter and equals the value of a point, u1 equals:<br />
      0 for u being 5,10,15,20,...<br />
      1 for u being 6,11,16,21,...<br />
      2 for u being 7,12,...<br />
      3 for u being 8,13,...<br />
      4 for u being 9,14,...<br />
      <br />
      For a more complex use of this see the attachment. The preset calculates the whole 3D rotation thing, music responce and scope shape only once for all of the cn(6) columns.<br />

      <p class="post-content">My (and most everyone who doesn't depend on El-Vis's engine) 3D code is several FPS faster than El-Vis's, and it's a whole lot more user friendly. Also, for those who didn't know: using zs=sqrt(maxdistance) projects the object so it is always inside the window. To find the maximum distance from the center of any object to a point on the object, use this method: For any variables (e.g. i and v), assume they are as high as they can go (e.g. i=1, v=1). Then simplify all your calculations. For example:<br />
      (tpi=acos(-1)*2=2*pi)<br />
      <br />
      r=i*tpi;<br />
      x1=sin(r); y1=cos(r); z1=v/4;<br />
      <br />
      r=1*tpi=tpi;<br />
      x1=sin(tpi)=0; y1=cos(tpi)=1; z1=1/4=0.25;<br />
      <br />
      Now, find maxdistance like this:<br />
      sqrt(x1*x1+y1*y1+z1*z1)=sqrt(0*0+1*1+0.25*0.25)=sqrt(1.125)<br />
      <br />
      So for the example scope, zs should equal sqrt(sqrt(1.125)*2)=pow(4.5,0.25).<br />
      <br />
      If you want the scope to be slightly inside the frame, use a higher zs. If you want it to be slightly outside the frame, use a lower zs.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ox,oy,oz = Camera Position</li>

        <li>pitch,roll,yaw = Camera Rotation Angles</li>

        <li>density = Fog Density (Exponential Squared)</li>

        <li>j = Synchronization Variable (js = timing speed)</li>
      </ul>It limits the pitch to +/-.5 (Vertical) so there aren't any gimble situations, and automatic roll is created for changes in yaw.

If some method saves alot fps compared to the others, yeah it's good to be mentioned, but if it saves only like 0.1 fps you think that this thread should be filled with codes/tips like these ?? :P<br />
      <br />
      And what comes to my presets. Usually the use of complex colors makes the preset slow. And colors aren't just that easy to optimize. Of course I always try to erase things you don't necessarily need &amp; try to make it as fast as possible, but sometimes you just can't make it any faster without radical changes. Sure I can replace all those tricky colors with a Utone or two for some real boost up, but that's just not me....</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, just a tip...as long as we're on this page of<br />
      the thread, try just typing in your carriage returns<br />
      like this...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, just one thing to remember as AVSers: Any god<br />
      damned thing is possible in AVS once you put your<br />
      mind to it. Trust me, if I didn't keep telling<br />
      myself this, I wouldn't be doing any of what I've<br />
      been doing (i.e. 4D, life algorithms, etc.) I'd bet<br />
      money that Jheriko's been having to reasure himself<br />
      of this a lot for some of his scopes lately ;) My<br />
      point is, you shouldn't just give up because you think<br />
      it can't be done. That's not a good reason. Give up<br />
      because you're lazy, or because you need to clip your<br />
      toenails, or for something important like that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a simple one that I'm sue everyone here knows. Might help a<br />
      noob though. (that is kinda what this thread was intended to do, right?)<br />
      <br />
      sin, cos, and tan are all calculated from the radian value.<br />
      This means the wavs have a period of 2*PI.<br />
      <br />
      sin(3.141) = sin(3.141) = sin(6.282) = 0<br />
      sin (3.141/2) = 1<br />
      sin (3.141*3/2) = -1</p>

      <br />
      I still have ideas that I'm forcing myself<br />
      into doing right now, the coolest AVS i've<br />
      made haven't been released yet because they<br />
      don't work properly, but like atero said,<br />
      anything is possible so I never give up on<br />
      them, I just keep working on them in the<br />
      background. Like that sonic battlefield from<br />
      pack VI, I'm still working on that on and off.<br />
      <br />
      The point is never to give up, force yourself<br />
      through to the end. Thats more general life<br />
      advice though.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Here is something more useful though; I'm certain<br />
      that a lot of you out there know exactly what you<br />
      want to do in AVS but have no idea about what<br />
      sort of maths you need to do it. I'm also certain<br />
      that there are a lot of mathematical methods<br />
      that would be useful for AVS if we knew about them.<br />
      Personally I think that maths is pretty important<br />
      for AVS (the technical side at least) so if you<br />
      have any maths questions my tip would be to check<br />
      <a href="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/" target="_blank">this cool page</a> that I found, or alternatively send<br />
      me some mail. I'm not going to pretend to know<br />
      everything about maths but I have a lot of knowledge<br />
      and a lot of textbooks too. :)<br />

      EDIT: Here are some trig identities to add to Jaheckelsafar's list, these will probably all have some applications in AVS, don't ask me what though:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br /><br />cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)<br />cos(pi/6) = sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2<br />cos(pi/3) = sin(pi/6) = 1/2<br /><br />(sin(x))^2+(cos(x))^2 = 1<br />cos(x)                = sin(x+pi/2)<br />cos(-x)               = cos(x)<br />sin(-x)               = -sin(x)<br />tan(x)                = sin(x)/cos(x)<br />cot(x) = 1/tan(x)     = cos(x)/sin(x)<br />sec(x)                = 1/cos(x)<br />csc(x)                = 1/sin(x)<br /><br />sin(x+y)              = cos(x)sin(y)+sin(x)cos(y)<br />sin(x-y)              = cos(x)sin(y)-sin(x)cos(y)<br />cos(x+y)              = cos(x)cos(y)-sin(x)sin(y)<br />cos(x-y)              = cos(x)cos(y)+sin(x)sin(y)<br />sin(2x)               = 2sin(x)cos(x)<br />cos(2x)               = 2(cos(x))^2-1<br />cos(2x)               = 1-2(sin(x))^2<br />cos(3x)               = 4(cos(x))^3-3cos(x)<br />sin(3x)               = 3sin(x)-4(sin(x))^3<br /><br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      There are a ton more things like this, identities<br />
      for cos(ax) and sin(ax) for instance, but I can't<br />
      remember them all off of the top of my head. :p

      <p class="post-content">Hey there,<br />
      <br />
      I was wanting to ask, (I've spent the last week going throught the forums) If some one could give me a running example purley for reference how to create a plane in 3D SSC and effect it with this function<br />
      <br />
      z=x*e^(-x^2-y^2)<br />
      <br />
      I use a 3d ploting program that I'm used to and enter this<br />
      <br />
      plot3d(x*exp(-x^2-y^2), x=-2..2 y=-2..2)<br />
      <br />
      works fine .. You should see the triped stuff I'm getting "TRYING to emulate this to AVS.. I've totaly forgot how to rearange the "e" with log and I got paper and shit all over my desk and room. ahhhhhhhhh where's my text books... I'm also giving up smoking 3 days now.<br />
      <br />
      z being the third axis of course, e is the exponent and ^ is to the power. Because I'm used to this program alot I tend to have blunders converting to AVS. Gimme a couple of weeks tho no probs but hey I'm always looking to learn quicker from some experienced bruzza'z.<br />
      <br />
      If anyone feeling Crwayzie mabey give z=cos(x)*sin(y) a try and show us. I feel that if I see an example of something I've done I might be able to bridge the gap faster.<br />
      <br />
      :weird:<br />
      <br />
      P.s. I's it just me or does anyone here alos go to sleep and end up dreaming about Freakin' equation's accompanied by some major tripped lighting visual dreams.... waaaaaaah. sheeesh If only I could remember what code I was dreaming I might be able to pull something awsome out of my subconcious ... I guess the best thing to say here is ...<br />
