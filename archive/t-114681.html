<div class="posttext">As i have made avs for 2 years now, i really don't know much about how to do things differently.<br />
<br />
Confused?<br />
Read more.<br />
<br />
As Advanced Visualization Studio is a highly customizable visualization plugin/component there are usually many ways to do simple things. And when it comes to coding your own superscopes and dynamic movements there are several different ways to make things, like in the dynamic movement using rectangular coordinates rather than polar coordinates to create the exactly same effect.<br />
<br />
Sometimes if you do things differently you may gain some priviledges, like better frame rates or the benefits of using a different coordinate system. Also when you use the built-in functions differently you may get faster&amp;better results than doing the same thing with different effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE<br />
Creating a rotoblitter effect in movement with both polar- &amp; rectangular coordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Polar<br />
r=r+0.1<br />
<br />
BENEFITS:<br />
Simple, easy and a fast way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rectangular<br />
x=x+y*0.1 ;<br />
y=y-x*0.1<br />
<br />
BENEFITS:<br />
You can shift it around the screen which can't be done in polar coordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
These helpful speed up tricks and better quality tips are scattered all over the forum, so what im asking here is to collect all those helpful notes into a single forum post, this post.<br />
<br />
So feel free to post your ideas and comments how something that is frequently used can be done faster&amp;better, this is all for the common good and will surely help us all as we are always searching a alternative way to make presets.<br />
<br />
And please remember that, althought the most tips consider coding there is still many different ways to use the built-in effects differently and still get the same effect. If you have discovered a clever way of using example: Trans / Water , you can post it here so it will help other avs artists as well.<br />
<br />
Hope you all understanded the point of this post and hope that you all contribute as much as you can ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bilinear is interpolation linearly in 2D... like zooming on a picture, but instead of blocky pixels you get a blurry, smooth texture.<br />
<br />
Trilinear is interpolation linearly in 3D.   It's commonly used to interpolate bilinearly between textures and linearly between an MIP-maps on a 3D card.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What i would like to know is: What is the fastest way to create a fullscreen gradient? I have used this method:<br />
<br />
1 single ssc line<br />
<br />
INIT: n=2<br />
PER POINT: x=i*2-1 ; y=1<br />
<br />
1 movement with rect coords (bilinear filtering on)<br />
y=y-0.0x<br />
<br />
It could also be done by using a gradient line and then using a movement with x=0.<br />
<br />
Which way is faster? Or is there even a faster way to do it?<br />

<br />
Im not sure how the conical gradient is done, but i guess it's just using the r=0 movement and then using a color code in a superscope like col=sin(i*pi). I don't have avs right now so i can't check did i get those other two right, so ill edit this post tomorrow (at 8:XXam gmt +2).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well yes you can use just one superscope, but to fill the entire screen with just one superscope requires a big numpoint number and the bigger the resolution the more numpoints and more slower it is. With the scope and the movement technique the numpoint number always stays the same and still the whole screen gets filled with the gradient.<br />
<br />
There for the movement and ssc technique is a lot faster than using one BIG ssc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">GRADIENTS :<br />
<br />
Note : &quot;v&quot; stands for variable (Replace with something), and it will be number-tagged. Red/green/blue is to be coded yourself.<br />
<br />
Vertical, Horizontal, and Radial gradients already mentioned. Remember, you can always use another D/M to morph the gradient into one desired.<br />
<br />
Fullscreen Gradients :<br />
<br />
Horizontal gradient (Colors cycling left-right) :<br />
<br />
x=-1+i*2;<br />
v1=bnot(v1) OR v1=1-v1<br />
y=v1*2-1;<br />
<br />
Vertical : Exchange x and y.<br />
<br />
Polar : You'll need dot-grid and colorcode it... Too slow.<br />
<br />
-You can combine Hor. and Ver. Gradients to make combinations. Experiment with render modes.<br />
<br />
Cheap fullscreen combo gradient :<br />
<br />
Use 2 lines, perpendicular, use a good linewidth (30-50 should do it), then use a movement to fill the screen. (Technique from several of UnConeD's presets) (Is it copyrighted? :p)<br />
<br />
Dot-Grid :<br />
<br />
http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=83695 - But I'll post the code here for convenience. The one here have edited variables to signify the new variables.<br />
<br />
FRAME :<br />
<br />
v1=w+1; v2=h+1; n=v1*v2; v3=0; v4=0; v5=1/ww; v6=1/hh;<br />
<br />
POINT :<br />
<br />
x=v3*v5*2-1; y=v4*v6*2-1;<br />
<br />
v3=if(above(v3+1,v1),0,v3+1);<br />
v4=if(v3,v4,v4+1);<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
But of course, that will be goddamn slow. You can always reduce the amount of points and manipulate the size to conform with the screen.<br />
In colorcoding, use x and y, i won't work well. Additional tips are in the original page.<br />
<br />
Examples : El-Vis - I Cannot Dance, Carry Me Home, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, and some others.<br />
<br />
It's quite slow, but is the most versatile, providing you use the right effects. You can also use convolution filter to make the pixels bigger and make a pixel-doubled effect.<br />
<br />

<br />
All I can think for now... I think there are more ways...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here are some code tips for you. :)<br />
<br />
Optimise everything. Higher FPS makes your presets a lot nicer. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
<br />
3D transformation<br />
<br />
x=x1/z1;<br />
y=y1/z1;<br />
<br />
can be made faster by using:<br />
<br />
z1=1/z1;<br />
x=x1*z1;<br />
y=y1*z1;<br />
<br />
using trig in conjunction with a timer can be made faster too:<br />
<br />
on beat:<br />
<br />
drx=0.2*getosc(0.2,0.2,0);<br />
<br />
per frame:<br />
<br />
rx=rx+drx;crx=cos(rx);<br />
<br />
per pixel:<br />
<br />
x=crx;<br />
y=0;<br />
<br />
Using this sort of thing a lot can make your code faster. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">3D transformation is:<br />
Xp=Xc/Zc;<br />
Yp=Yc/Zc;<br />
where Xc (x-coordinate) and Yc are any numbers, positive or negative, and Zc is positive.<br />
For a 3D object centered at the origin (0,0,0), use this formula:<br />
Xp=Xc/(Zc+sqrt(mD));<br />
Yp=Yc/(Zc+sqrt(mD));<br />
where mD (maximum distance) is the largest distance from the origin to a point on the object.<br />
<br />
Rotation around any point, line, plane, solid, etc:<br />
Ar=Ac*sin(theta)+Bc*cos(theta);<br />
Br=Ac*cos(theta)-Bc*sin(theta);<br />
where A and B are the axes defining the plane perpendicular to the axial point/line/plane/solid etc.  To find the perpendicular plane, simply use the 2 axes you do not use to define the axial object.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have a kind of a problem, I have used a static background/texture for a movement with bunch of effects. I have made it by putting all the effects inside a effectlist with ignore/replace and on beat active 1 frame. Then i have used a custom bpm set to 30bpm and put both of them inside another effect list with ignore/replace. It now takes about 1-3 seconds to start, but the fps is much higher since it doesn't have to render the texture all the time. This solution works fine, but what im asking is: Is there a even better way doing this? If you use avs effects to create a static background is there a way to only &quot;render&quot; it once? Or how i activate it right at the begin of a song?<br />
<br />
Hope you understand :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A better 3D code system:<br />

init: zs=sqrt(... *)<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
rx=rx+drx; ry=ry+dry; rz=rz+drz; cx=cos(x); sx=sin(x); cy=cos(y); sy=sin(y); cz=cos(z); sz=sin(z);<br />

<br />
rx, ry, and rz are the angles of rotation around the x, y, and z axes, respectively.  These angles are in radians (one radian = 180/pi degrees)<br />
A good place to define these values is in the beat section of the scope, e.g.:<br />
rx=rand(100)/1000-0.05; ry=rand(100)/1000-0.05; rz=rand(100)/1000-0.05;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dear Degnic...<br />
<br />
1) Are you talking to everyone who has replied to this forum or to one person and if, who?<br />
<br />
2) The faster the presets run the more enjoyable they are, besides it's more than just 0.&lt;insert ridiculous large ammount of zeros&gt;1 frames, example the gradients work a lot faster when you use different methods. And the static texture for a 3D movement or likes saves up huge ammount of fps if it is only rendered once per N beats. I made a preset with the static texture and the framerate difference between render-per-N-beat and render-all-the-time is incredibly huge, on my 266mhz pentium it was about 8 fps.<br />
<br />
3) Everything &amp; Anything can &amp; should be optimized. Or do you draw a static single colored ssc line with 800 numpoints when just 2 will do?<br />
<br />
4) Last, but not least, this thread was about people sharing their ways of doing things. Someone have might used some method for months/years never knowing that it could be done better&amp;faster.<br />
<br />
If you don't like people giving you helpful advice, buzz off. But by the looks, you are the one who should seriously learn how to do things faster.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is a trick that can save more than 100% fps.<br />
When you need more sinchronised scopes shaped the same you can make a counter and copy this scope to several locations. <br />
Example:<br />
<br />
init: <br />
n=500<br />
<br />
frame: <br />
t=t-0.05;u=0;<br />
<br />
point: <br />
u=u+1;u1=u%5;<br />
d=i/5;r=t+i*3.14159*4;x=cos(r)*d;y=sin(r)*d+(u1+0.5)/5*2-1;<br />
<br />
This will create 1 spiral scope and place it at u1/5*2-1 locations,  u is a counter and equals the value of a point, u1 equals:<br />
0 for u being 5,10,15,20,...<br />
1 for u being 6,11,16,21,...<br />
2 for u being 7,12,...<br />
3 for u being 8,13,...<br />
4 for u being 9,14,...<br />
<br />
For a more complex use of this see the attachment. The preset calculates the whole 3D rotation thing, music responce and scope shape only once for all of the cn(6) columns.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the shity explenation but i find it hard to express myself in english. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My (and most everyone who doesn't depend on El-Vis's engine) 3D code is several FPS faster than El-Vis's, and it's a whole lot more user friendly.  Also, for those who didn't know: using zs=sqrt(maxdistance) projects the object so it is always inside the window.  To find the maximum distance from the center of any object to a point on the object, use this method: For any variables (e.g. i and v), assume they are as high as they can go (e.g. i=1, v=1).  Then simplify all your calculations.  For example:<br />
(tpi=acos(-1)*2=2*pi)<br />
<br />
r=i*tpi;<br />
x1=sin(r); y1=cos(r); z1=v/4;<br />
<br />
r=1*tpi=tpi;<br />
x1=sin(tpi)=0; y1=cos(tpi)=1; z1=1/4=0.25;<br />
<br />
Now, find maxdistance like this:<br />
sqrt(x1*x1+y1*y1+z1*z1)=sqrt(0*0+1*1+0.25*0.25)=sqrt(1.125)<br />
<br />
So for the example scope, zs should equal sqrt(sqrt(1.125)*2)=pow(4.5,0.25).<br />
<br />
If you want the scope to be slightly inside the frame, use a higher zs.  If you want it to be slightly outside the frame, use a lower zs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No tug, you got me wrong. I'm not saying that every tip in this thread are total bullshit, but what I am saying is that this thread shouldn't be filled with codes / tips (and posts like this ;) ) that doesn't affect to fps rate &quot;efficiently&quot; . I tried some of these and I really couldn't see any fps difference between code A and code B. If some method saves alot fps compared to the others, yeah it's good to be mentioned, but if it saves only like 0.1 fps you think that this thread should be filled with codes/tips like these ?? :P<br />
<br />
And what comes to my presets. Usually the use of complex colors makes the preset slow. And colors aren't just that easy to optimize. Of course I always try to erase things you don't necessarily need &amp; try to make it as fast as possible, but sometimes you just can't make it any faster without radical changes. Sure I can replace all those tricky colors with a Utone or two for some real boost up, but that's just not me....</div></div><hr />

Anyway, just one thing to remember as AVSers: Any god<br />

mind to it.  Trust me, if I didn't keep telling<br />
myself this, I wouldn't be doing any of what I've<br />

money that Jheriko's been having to reasure himself<br />
of this a lot for some of his scopes lately ;)  My<br />
point is, you shouldn't just give up because you think<br />
it can't be done.  That's not a good reason.  Give up<br />
because you're lazy, or because you need to clip your<br />
toenails, or for something important like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a simple one that I'm sue everyone here knows. Might help a<br />
noob though. (that is kinda what this thread was intended to do, right?)<br />
<br />
sin, cos, and tan are all calculated from the radian value.<br />
This means the wavs have a period of 2*PI.<br />
<br />
sin(3.141) = sin(3.141) = sin(6.282) = 0<br />
sin (3.141/2) = 1<br />

<br />
That is true.<br />
<br />
I still have ideas that I'm forcing myself <br />
into doing right now, the coolest AVS i've <br />
made haven't been released yet because they <br />
don't work properly, but like atero said, <br />
anything is possible so I never give up on <br />
them, I just keep working on them in the <br />
background. Like that sonic battlefield from<br />
pack VI, I'm still working on that on and off.<br />
<br />
The point is never to give up, force yourself<br />
through to the end. Thats more general life<br />
advice though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is something more useful though; I'm certain<br />
that a lot of you out there know exactly what you<br />
want to do in AVS but have no idea about what<br />
sort of maths you need to do it. I'm also certain<br />
that there are a lot of mathematical methods<br />
that would be useful for AVS if we knew about them.<br />
Personally I think that maths is pretty important<br />
for AVS (the technical side at least) so if you<br />
have any maths questions my tip would be to check<br />
this cool page (http://mathforum.org/dr.math/) that I found, or alternatively send<br />
me some mail. I'm not going to pretend to know<br />
everything about maths but I have a lot of knowledge<br />
and a lot of textbooks too. :)<br />

<br />
EDIT: Here are some trig identities to add to Jaheckelsafar's list, these will probably all have some applications in AVS, don't ask me what though:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)<br />
cos(pi/6) = sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2<br />
cos(pi/3) = sin(pi/6) = 1/2<br />
<br />
(sin(x))^2+(cos(x))^2 = 1<br />
cos(x)                = sin(x+pi/2)<br />
cos(-x)               = cos(x)<br />
sin(-x)               = -sin(x)<br />
tan(x)                = sin(x)/cos(x)<br />
cot(x) = 1/tan(x)     = cos(x)/sin(x)<br />
sec(x)                = 1/cos(x)<br />
csc(x)                = 1/sin(x)<br />
<br />
sin(x+y)              = cos(x)sin(y)+sin(x)cos(y)<br />
sin(x-y)              = cos(x)sin(y)-sin(x)cos(y)<br />
cos(x+y)              = cos(x)cos(y)-sin(x)sin(y)<br />
cos(x-y)              = cos(x)cos(y)+sin(x)sin(y)<br />
sin(2x)               = 2sin(x)cos(x)<br />
cos(2x)               = 2(cos(x))^2-1<br />
cos(2x)               = 1-2(sin(x))^2<br />
cos(3x)               = 4(cos(x))^3-3cos(x)<br />
sin(3x)               = 3sin(x)-4(sin(x))^3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a ton more things like this, identities <br />
for cos(ax) and sin(ax) for instance, but I can't <br />
remember them all off of the top of my head. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey there,<br />
<br />
I was wanting to ask, (I've spent the last week going throught the forums) If some one could give me a running example purley for reference how to create a plane in 3D SSC and effect it with this function<br />
<br />
z=x*e^(-x^2-y^2) <br />
<br />
I use a 3d ploting program that I'm used to and enter this<br />
<br />
plot3d(x*exp(-x^2-y^2), x=-2..2 y=-2..2)<br />
<br />
works fine .. You should see the triped stuff I'm getting &quot;TRYING to emulate this to AVS.. I've totaly forgot how to rearange the &quot;e&quot; with log and I got paper and shit all over my desk and room. ahhhhhhhhh where's my text books... I'm also giving up smoking 3 days now.<br />
<br />
z being the third axis of course, e is the exponent and ^ is to the power. Because I'm used to this program alot I tend to have blunders converting to AVS. Gimme a couple of weeks tho no probs but hey I'm always looking to learn quicker from some experienced bruzza'z.<br />
<br />
If anyone feeling Crwayzie mabey give z=cos(x)*sin(y) a try and show us. I feel that if I see an example of something I've done I might be able to bridge the gap faster. <br />
<br />
:weird: <br />
<br />
P.s. I's it just me or does anyone here alos go to sleep and end up dreaming about Freakin' equation's accompanied by some major tripped lighting visual dreams.... waaaaaaah. sheeesh If only I could remember what code I was dreaming I might be able to pull something awsome out of my subconcious ...

<div class="posttext">Atero: if you don't have anything constructive to add to someone's question, shut up please.<br />
<br />
VisualAgnosia: the superscope is just a drawing tool... you give it (x,y) coordinates on the screen with a color if you wish.<br />
<br />
So if you want to plot a graph of a function z=f(x,y), you'll first need to write code that traverses a grid of points in 2D rectangle, then calculates the z value for that point and then transforms the point with perspective.<br />
<br />
The best way to do this is not to use the 'i' counter in the superscope, but make your own counters. For example, this draws a simple 20x20 grid:<br />
<br />
<br />
init:<br />
n=400;<br />
<br />
per frame:<br />
t=t-.05;px=0;py=0;ct=cos(t);st=sin(t);<br />
<br />
per point:<br />
gx=(px/19)*2-1; gy=(py/19)*2-1;<br />
gz=-exp(-(sqr(gx)+sqr(gy))*4)*3+1.6;<br />
x1=gx*ct-gy*st;y1=gx*st+gy*ct;<br />
x=x1/(y1+3);y=gz/(y1+3);<br />
px=if(below(px,19),px+1,0);<br />
py=if(equal(px,0),py+1,py);<br />
red=if(equal(px,1),0,1);green=red;blue=red;<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a lot going on here, so I'll dissect it:<br />
<br />
First, we have 400 points on our grid, so we set n to 400.<br />
We'll be rotating the grid around, and we'll use 't' as the angle, which is decreased every frame by 0.05 radians. We also calculate the cosine and sine of the angle in the frame routine so we don't have to calculate it again every point, for speed reasons.<br />
We'll be traversing a 20x20 grid, and we'll store the current grid point in (px,py). px and py will take on the values 0-19 (20 points), first x then y. We start at (0,0).<br />
<br />
Per point, we transform (px,py) (between (0,0) and (19,19)) into (gx,gy) a point between (-1,-1) and (1,1). This is done by dividing by 19, multiplying by 2 and subtracting 1 (this piece can be done faster if we merge everything into one multiplication + add/sub, but this is easier to understand):<br />
<br />
      /19     *2      -1<br />
0..19 -&gt; 0..1 -&gt; 0..2 -&gt; -1..1<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, we calculate 'gz' based on gx and gy. I use exp(-(sqr(gx)+sqr(gy))) which is an exponential 'hump' the shape of the normal gaussian distribution. We multiply it by 3 and add 1.6 to make it fit in the AVS window.<br />
<br />
Next we rotate (gx,gy) by t radians, so that we get the point (x1,y1). We now use x1 as the x-coordinate, gz as the y-coordinate (z points up) and y1 as the depth coordinate (y points into the screen). We transform it into perspective by dividing (x,y) by z (plus a camera offset of 3).<br />
<br />
Now all we need to do is make sure (px,py) traverse the values 0-19. First, we check per point if px is smaller than 19: if so, we add 1. If px equals 19, we reset it back to zero. If px equals zero, we increase py by 1.<br />
This has the effect of traversion one row on the grid, and when we reach the end, we go to the next row and start over.<br />
<br />
 0  1  2  3  4  5      18 19<br />
 .  .  .  .  .  . ..... .  .  |<br />
 .  .  .  .  .  . ..... .  .  |<br />
  ----------              \|/<br />
                              v<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally there's a little extra: AVS draws the superscope as one chain of line segments. This means that there will be a connecting line between the different rows, which is not what we want. So, we set the color to black for that certain line segment, and white for all the rest: if you use additive or maximum blending, the black lines won't show up.<br />
<br />
Tadaa... you now have a rotating plot.<br />
You could duplicate the scope and reverse the meaning of gx and gy in the second copy, that way you get a grid of lines. Make sure you reload the preset to synchronize the two scopes... (result is attached)<br />

<div class="posttext">Well I didn't expect that either ...<br />
<br />
Thats quite a conecise explantation, Totaly get it..mind you I'm gonna print it out and study it like I have with 10 or so other wicked posts I've found. I'm getting a bit of a progression thing happening... from a couple days ago I'm getting more and more things undercontrol... still a long way to go. As it goes it's just a matter of sticking with it and &quot;Dreaming new ideas&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit of props for AVS <br />
<br />
--- Studing maths.. which I find interesting usually.. To use something with a straight away effect on visuals in such a dynamic flow of colour and music... Somehow's effected the time I spend studying by three fold ---    weird???<br />
<br />
Thanks for the effort again UnConeD. <br />
you've helped yet ANOTHER potential AVSer bridge another gap<br />
<br />
 <br />
A note to other neewuubies like me have a look the load example superscopes, the code in there will give some indication as to the layout of the code. B4 you wrote this last post UnConeD I was resorting to the 3D layout they had going on in there.<br />

<div class="posttext">Tuggummi started the first one, but that was long ago. I am sure there will be many new tricks (and Tips).<br />
Just post them here,<br />
Here's one:<br />
<br />
when the amount of ssc's is quite large then cramp all of these into one.:<br />
eg:<br />
<br />
init:<br />
n=1000;a1=1/(499-1);vrem=n/10;pi=acos(-1);tpi=acos(-1)*2<br />
point:<br />
cp=bnot(cp);cn=cn+1;i1=i1+a1;colc=bnot(equal(cn,501));<br />
trans=above(cn,500);v1=if(bnot(cn%vrem),v,v1+abs(v/10));<br />
d=if(cp,1+v1*0.2,.98);th=t+i1*tpi; outx=sin(th)*d*r;outy=cos(th)*d*r;<br />
inx=bnot(cp)*sin(th)*.3;iny=bnot(cp)*cos(th)*.3;<br />
x=if(trans,outx,inx)+ox;y=if(trans,outy,iny)+oy;<br />
red=colc;green=colc*.5;blue=0;<br />
frame:<br />
fr=fr+.01;t=t+ti*.1;ti=ti*.8;r=.4;cn=0;i1=0;ox=sin(fr)/2;oy=cos(fr)/2<br />
beat:<br />
ti=1;r=.5;hu=rand(618)*.01;fr=fr+sin(t*hu) <br />
<br />
the trick is to draw everything in one ssc and then blacken out the point connecting the two objects.<br />
then use a maximum or addictive blend to hide the trick</div></div><hr />

Shreyas : How about posting that code and explaining the code step by step? :p<br />
<br />
On the other hand, colormaps can be used to replace a few colorclips. As long as the colors are not too close together, you can just use 2 of the same color and use a bounding box to make sure you get the right color.  <br />
<br />
I have done that thing to improve the speed, colourmaps and clips do the opposite!<br />
i have already explained a bit of the code,but here's a detailed one.<br />
<br />
set cn=cn+1 in point, this will increase value of cn every point, an ideal way to count the number of the point.<br />
<br />
then use custom i values,<br />
this is what i figured out:<br />
incrementation value of i is inversely proportional to (n-1).<br />
so, if n=10; then <br />
after every point : i=i+1/(n-1);<br />
i.e i=i+1/9;<br />
i.e i=i+0.111111111111111111111111111111111.<br />
so if you draw a circle using i1 instead of i when cn is less than 10 and then draw some other object when cn&gt;10, then blacken out the point joining the two objects, you get two separate objects.<br />
<br />
I hope you understood atleast some part of this, because I find it hard to explain things, especially complicated ones. if you cant figure out what this means, then maybe i will write an essay on this topic, after thinking hard and selecting my words :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th March 2003, 13:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">This one is all about the 2 in 1 scopes, I wrote all this when I was offline in notepad and then posted it here:<br />
the previous two explainations just explained the concept, now here's the explaination of the actual code:<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
Lets just consider the pixel part first because the beat and frame part is just for the movement of the scope.<br />
here's the code for the ssc:<br />
<br />
some variables required at init:(in fact, all the variables in the actual init are required :) )<br />
<br />
n=1000;a1=1/(499-1);vrem=n/10;pi=acos(-1);tpi=acos(-1)*2;<br />
(I will explain their use later on)<br />
<br />
reset values per frame :<br />
cn=0;i1=0;<br />
<br />
pixel part:<br />
cp=bnot(cp);<br />
cn=cn+1;<br />
i1=i1+a1;<br />
colc=bnot(equal(cn,501));<br />
trans=above(cn,500);<br />
v1=if(bnot(cn%vrem),v,v1+abs(v/10));<br />
d=if(cp,1+v1*0.2,.98);<br />
th=t+i1*tpi;<br />
outx=sin(th)*d;<br />
outy=cos(th)*d;<br />
inx=bnot(cp)*sin(th)*.3;<br />
iny=bnot(cp)*cos(th)*.3;<br />
x=if(trans,outx,inx)+ox;y=if(trans,outy,iny)+oy;<br />
red=colc;green=colc*.5;blue=0;<br />
<br />
explaination:<br />
1) value of cp swaps beetween 1 and 0 every point. this is basically used to make solid scopes.<br />
eg:- when we multiply x and y with cp, and when<br />
a) cp=1, then x=x and y=y<br />
b) if cp=0 then x=0 and y=0.<br />
So, after every alternate point, the co-ordinates of the next point are (0,0). so, when we render the scope as lines, the entire part is filled with lines and we get a solid scope (provided the no of pts (n) is quite high)<br />
<br />
2) cn:- this is the number of the point drawn. it is reseted to 0 every frame.<br />
<br />
3) i1:- Custom i value. i1 is incremented by a1 every point. <br />
value of a1 is 1/(499-1). ie. 488. ie.0.0208333...<br />
<br />
4) colc:- used for hiding the point which connects the two objects.<br />
   colc=bnot(equal(cn,501));<br />
   So, when cn=501, bnot(equal(cn,501)) will return 0 else it will retun 1<br />
   cn is the number of the point. bu assigning rgb values to colc, the values for the 501th point will be 0 and for the other points will be 1.<br />
<br />
5) trans:- no connection with its name and its values. I too dont remember why I used such a variable name.<br />
trans=above(cn,500); this will return 1 if cn is above 500, else it will return 0. (use explained later).<br />
<br />
6) v1: Custom v value. <br />
   v1=if(bnot(cn%vrem),v,v1+abs(v/10));<br />
   if cn is divided by vrem(n/10 i.e 1000/10 i.e 100)<br />
   and the remainder is zero ( vrem is a factor of cn) then return v else    return v1+abs(v/10);<br />
   In short v1 is used for the waves created in the outer circle. whenever    vrem is a factor of cn, then value of v1 will jump to v ( i.e after    every 100 point value of v1 will be v), else it will be v1+abs(v/10),    the will create the normal waves.<br />
<br />
7) d is distance for the outer circle. this will swap beetween .98 and       1+v1*.2 as cp swaps beetween 1 and 0.  <br />
   d=if(cp,1+v1*0.2,.98);<br />
<br />
8) th:- angle ( usually r ) th = t+i1*tpi;<br />
   we have used cutom i value, so at the start i1=0 and at the end it is roughly 2. this is because we want to draw basically 2 circles.<br />
<br />
9) outx=sin(th)*d;<br />
   outy=cos(th)*d;<br />
   the outer circle. conversion of polar coords into rectangular coords.<br />
<br />
10) inx=bnot(cp)*sin(th)*.3;<br />
    iny=bnot(cp)*cos(th)*.3;<br />
    the inner circle (d=.3). value swaps beetween 0 and sin(th)*.3 or     cos(th)*.3 for the solid fill effect.<br />
<br />
11) x=if(trans,outx,inx)+ox;<br />
    y=if(trans,outy,iny)+oy;<br />
    trans:<br />
    trans=above(cn,500);<br />
    so,  if cn&lt;500 draws the outer circle, else draw the inner circle.<br />
<br />
12) red=colc;green=colc*.5;blue=0;<br />
    colc:<br />
    colc=bnot(equal(cn,501));<br />
    if cn=501, then red=0; green=0;blue=0;<br />
    if cn!=501 then red=1; green=.5;blue=0.<br />
    this is for the orange colour.<br />
<br />
finally, i did it. hope you understand this, I havent explained the movment part because it is all normal and basic stuff.<br />
<br />
this is the preset I used the scope in:<br />
found in my first pack.<br />

<br />
Custom inversion :<br />
<br />
White SSC in an effect list, XOR output. Any other white surface will do.<br />
<br />
AVS Lingo :<br />
<br />
SSC - Superscope<br />
DM - Dynamic Movement<br />
DDM - Dynamic Distance Modifier<br />
DS - Dynamic Shift<br />
MP - Moving Particles<br />
Convo Filter (Or just plain convo) - Convolution Filter<br />
Fast Brite - Fast Brightness<br />
(There are more, figure out yourself)<br />
<br />
Chroming :<br />
Chroming is changing the spectrum from 0...255 into 0..255...0 where 128 is now 255 - So it filters out anything too white.<br />
It can be done in several ways :<br />
-Effect list - Fast brite - Replace input, SubBlend2 output, another fast brite outside.<br />
-Buffer save, clear screen, 3 effect lists. One colormap for each list, additive blend for each list (except for the top). Each taking different color, with buffer restore on top of them. Change the white into the corresponding colors, drag them to middle. Add a black in the end. (SLOW, too much work, just saying it)<br />
-List (Replace input, max output) with invert in it, then an invert (outside the list) and a fast brite.<br />
-Jheriko's multi filter. Fastest.<br />
<br />
Rotation Delay :<br />
<br />
(Copied directly from fsk's guide. For the preset in action, go to fsk.deviantart.com, galleries, and then &quot;Zvezda&quot;)<br />
<br />
rotation dellay<br />
<br />
<br />
init:<br />
effect=25<br />
<br />
on beat:<br />
g=getosc(0,0,0)/15<br />
<br />
per fr.:<br />
<br />
rz1=rz1+g;    srz1=sin(rz1)/10;      rz2=rz2+srz1;<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
usualy you just use the rz1 but in this case you have to put it thru another sin to make the changes in the rotation soft (dunno how to put it otherwise - remeber the first tentacle I sent you, it didn't have tis and it kinnda jumped on beat)<br />
<br />
per point:<br />
<br />
x1=i*1.6-.8;<br />
y1=0;<br />
<br />
dst=sqrt(x1*x1+y1*y1);    <br />
-----------------------------------<br />
The distance from center <br />
<br />
rz=rz2-srz1*dst*effect;<br />
----------------------------------<br />
this is the effect part<br />
<br />
srz1 is the current change in rotation, so if you aplly les (-) rotation to the points further away from the center (*dst) you get the desired effect :).<br />
<br />
cz=cos(rz);<br />
sz=sin(rz);<br />
----------------<br />
this needs to be in the per point.<br />
  <br />
x=x1*cz+y1*sz;<br />
y=y1*cz-x1*sz<br />
<br />
That is it :D. For 3D aplly to all three axes and use a 3D distance<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Shape Engines :<br />
<br />
Use point-by-point assigning (p=p+1 in pixel, p=0 in frame, and assign coordinates). Put in p%(points used in the shape) in place of the p in equal(p,n).<br />
Use p1=if(equal(p%(points used in the shape),1),p1+1,p1) in pixel and p1=0 in frame to assign numbers for the shape.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Fix aspect ratio before posting your pack, or UnConeD will be angry at you.<br />
<br />
Don't do the normal getosc syncing, or Atero will be angry at you.<br />
Heck, he'll be angry at you anyways - The standard greeting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">There is another way of syncing other than with getoscs or getspecs?<br />
please explaino.<br />
<br />
Also..<br />
There are some *hidden* coding paramerters for sscs and dms etc.<br />
exp(x) returnes the 'e' (the exponential constant) to the power of x.<br />
atan2(a,b) i really have no idea.<br />
and (for the true n00b)<br />
alpha=0..1 -alpha sets the level of alpha blending in a dm if the blend setting is activated. this is done per point, so that mixtures/grandients of input and output can be created. can also be used to add fog and/or cover 'uglyedge' syndrome for 3d scopes. But i wont get into that. If you can ray-trace, then i think you can work this out for yourself.<br />
<br />
also pi=acos(-1); <br />
cheers to whoever enlightened us on this one. (methinks steven)<br />
<br />
thats all i can think of for now..<br />
<br />
Oh Yeah.. With SSC. Never restrict yourself to creating shapes strictly from x/y= some form of 'i'.<br />
This is a very restrictive mothod in some cases.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
init-- t=0; s=0; n=64<br />
<br />
perframe-- t=0; s=0<br />
perpoint-- s=if(equal(t,8),s+1,s);<br />
           t=if(equal(t,8),0,t+1);<br />
           x=s/8; y=t/8<br />
<br />
this should creat a 8x8 dot grid, but i cant test it on this comp so correkt me if im wrong.<br />
use colour coding to blacken the bits where lines cross over screen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS Axer :<br />
<br />
Exp(x) and atan2(a,b) are already known, alpha is well known, pi is already a basic knowledge.<br />
<br />
Oh, and your code is wrong (I didn't test, so not 100% sure).<br />
1. T is never 8, so there is never any increase of t or s, so the counter won't work.<br />
2. The x will just draw across the screen, so the correction should be x=s/8-t+1;</div></div><hr />

My best advice is to not go into Whacko AVS or El-vis's stuff &amp; try to pick apart how the hell those codes work.  First go in, &amp; try some very simple codes.  Then check out other presets with very simple codes and see how they work.  I think most of my stuff is pretty easy, I don't use too many varibles &amp; other crap.  (shameless self promotion).<br />

All in all, start out small &amp; build from there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">here I am with my foot in my mouth.  I'm looking for some code that would treat a DynMove kinda like a basic sprite (if that makes sense,  I'm no good with programming talk).  All I want this DM to do is move around in a 3-D environment:  move up &amp; down, left &amp; right, near &amp; far.  I tried looking here, but nothign really popped out.  Does anyone have a uncomplicated way of doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th April 2003, 01:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm...I didn't know there were more than one flavors of Sprite :p<br />
<br />
<br />
So you want to move the AVS around and zoom in and out?<br />
<br />
That's very easy:<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
Rectangular coordiantes on<br />
<br />
xm=(insert x movement code here);<br />
ym=(insert x movement code here);<br />
zm=(insert x movement code here);<br />
zoom=1/z;<br />
<br />
pixel:<br />
x=(x+xm)*zoom;<br />
y=(y+ym)*zoom;<br />
<br />
<br />
of course, this will not handle rotation...if you want that, there was a post a while back.<br />
<br />
If you want to move a single object around against a static background, then you need to synchronize SSCs.<br />
<br />
This can be achieved by using a pseudorandom number generator.<br />
<br />
(search the forums for synchronzing superscopes, there will be a much better explanation than I can do here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th April 2003, 02:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well. As long as your sprite has a black border we can do this one fine with some cheaty psuedo 3D code. Here is a simple dm that I quickly wrote to demonstrate this.<br />
<br />
Per Frame:<br />
<br />
dz=sin(t)+1.2;<br />
dx=cos(t);<br />
dy=sin(2*t);<br />
t=t+0.01;<br />
z=1/(dz*0.5);<br />
<br />
Per Point:<br />
<br />
x=(x+dx)*z;<br />
y=(y+dy)*z;<br />
<br />
This works fine z for co-ordinates strictly greater than zero. Here dx, dy and dz represent the displacement of the sprite in the varying axes. A gridsize should be set for this, preferably large since it has to shrink the sprite sometimes. Set wrap to 'off' and we are done. If you want to draw the sprite over a background then simply chuck it in an effect list and use additive blending.<br />

<div class="posttext">Conversion of polar co-ords. into rectangular ones and vice-versa:<br />

to convert polar co-ords. into rectangular ones, use:<br />

<br />
(this is an approximate figure)<br />
PQRS is the quadrilaeral formed.<br />
Now, we have to find l(SQ) or d(S,Q)<br />
I will solve this as we solve our geomtery problems, <br />
as this will give you a more clear idea.<br />
<br />
Given:<br />
1) line x is perpendicaular to line y.<br />
2) d(S,R)=.8 , d(P,S)=.6<br />
3) seg PQ is perpendicular to line y &amp; seg RQ is perpendicular to line x.<br />
<br />
to find: d(S,Q) i.e length of seg SQ.<br />
Construction: Draw seg SQ ( I could'nt draw it here ) .<br />
Sol'n:<br />
         Statement                |Reason<br />
1) In, quad. PQRS,                |<br />
   m&lt;S=m&lt;P=m&lt;Q=m&lt;R=90 degrees     |statement 1 &amp; 3 of Given.<br />
                                  |  <br />
2) quad. PQRS is a rectangle.     |Statement 1) and def'n of a rectangle.<br />
                                  |<br />
3) seg PS is congreuent to seg QR |statement 2) and opposite sides of a <br />
                                  | rectangle are congruent.<br />
                                  |<br />
4) In triangle SQR,               |given statement 2) and statement 3)<br />
   seg SR = .8 and seg QR = .6    |<br />
                                  |<br />
5) In triangle SQR,               |<br />
   <br />
    SQ^2 = SR^2 + SQ^2            |Pythagorus theorem.<br />
&lt;=&gt; SQ = sqrt ( SR^2 + SQ^2 )<br />
&lt;=&gt; SQ = sqrt ( .8^2 + .6^2 )<br />
&lt;=&gt; SQ = sqrt ( .64 + .36 )<br />
       = sqrt ( 1.00 )<br />
       = 1<br />
therefore SQ = 1<br />
<br />
here, SQ = d<br />
so sqr ( d )  = sqr ( SR ) + sqr ( RQ )<br />
              = sqr ( X ) + sqr ( Y ) ( not the lines, but the position of the point )<br />
&lt;=&gt; d  =  sqrt ( sqr ( X ) + sqr ( Y )   <br />
<br />
It would be nice if someone explained how r=atan2(x,y) works.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">You just tried making that way too difficult.<br />
first off:<br />
x=d*cos(r)<br />
y=d*sin(r)<br />
you can get this merely by looking at the triangle.  R is the angle and d is the hypotenuse(sp).  Simple trig tells you that <br />
cos(r)=x/d<br />
sin(r)=y/d<br />
so those two equations are easy to derive.<br />
then, using pythagorean theorem<br />
d^2=x^2+y^2<br />
Also simple.<br />
and then<br />
tan(r)=y/x<br />
simple again.</div></div><hr />

The grid size in a DM won't affect quality unless you're trying to bend the picture. Full pic zooming and rotation will only be slowed down by a larger grid size.<br />
<br />
That and I like to reduce the movement speed when zoomed out. To do so, multiply the move values by the inverse of you zoom.<br />

Custom BPM - invert<br />
Custom BPM - skip x beats<br />
Color map<br />
The color map must have several rotating positions of a cyclic palette, and be set to &quot;Onbeat cycle&quot;.  A nice sort of hue shifter can be created this way.<br />
It'd be rather neat if we could actually wheedle a real cycler out of ucd, with dynamic cycle position 'n' stuff.... :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">somone asked how atan2 works:<br />
<br />
in case you didnt already know.. asin, acos and atan are the inverse functions of sin cos and tan.<br />
<br />
dont be confused however and think that asin(sin(x)), will neccessarily return x. Thnk of a circle and acknowledge that no matter how many times you got around the circle, sin(x) will always be the same at the same point of the circle. Now imagine that x is more than 2*pi (the circumference), this is just like going around a circle more than once, so all the values will be the same.<br />
<br />
The trouble with asin, acos and atan is that they do not even return the right values of x all the way around a circle!! Dont get me wrong, they have their uses. Consider sin(x) again, this finction will return 0 in two different positions while 0&gt;x&gt;2pi. one at 0 and one at pi. Now you can see that asin(sin(x)) will definatly not return the right values of x, because sin(x) has a pattern, but x does not. <br />
<br />
In reality, asin(sin(x)) will return x for only the first quadrant,<br />
After that x is reset to 0 at the start of every new quadrant. And with these rules.<br />
First quadrant: Asin(sin(x)) = x<br />
second quadrant:Asin(sin(x)) = 2pi-x<br />
third quadrant: Asin(sin(x)) = -x<br />
fourth quadrant:Asin(sin(x)) = -2pi+x<br />
<br />
Look at a unit circle or play around in avs and youll get how this works. Try this in a superscope:<br />
y=atan(tan(i*acos(-1)*2))/5;<br />
x=i/5<br />
and try replacing atan and tan with asin and sin. etc.<br />
<br />
To counter this, atan2 was invented.. pretty much you input two coordinates of a point (x,y) and it does something similar to atan(x/y) but it acknowledges that they are coodinates of the same point and works it out in some clever way that i dont yet know. <br />
<br />
So, atan2(x,y) returns the angle of the point x,y in radians from center (0,0).  <br />
If you look at alot of code however, people in avs have tended to use atan2(x,-y). This is because the y axis in avs is fliped. In trig we start from the bottom and goto top. I dont know why..<br />
<br />
It is also convention to start from the right at -1 and got anti clockwise around the circle.. (first quadrant is at top left). So i dont know why we arnt using atan2(-x,-y) but i wont argue because fsk and unconed use the other way, and they seem to know their shit.<br />
<br />
Correct me on anyof this please.. cause i could have easily have got confused. Oh, and if someone knew exactly how the function is calculated, it would be most helpful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">XOR blending mode was also asked about somewhere..<br />
<br />
Sadly itsnot as simple as you would hope.<br />
<br />
Xor is computed at the binary level. <br />
So, each pixel has the compondents r,g,b (depending on how old your comp is ho ho.) <br />
And each r,g, or b, can be described as a binary digit. (or bit)<br />
(0000,0000). <br />
<br />
ok.. lets lets just look at one channel, say r. and just one pixel.<br />
we have A=0010,1010, B=0101,0111<br />
<br />
dont wory about what those colours are, or even what those numbers are, i dont know either. <br />
<br />
For this demo, A is the old image, B is the blending image.<br />
<br />
A XOR B means the same as (A OR B)NOT(A AND B)<br />
in binary logic, 0 is false, 1 is true.<br />
<br />
so it will return &quot;TRUE&quot;(1) if a OR b are 1, but &quot;FALSE&quot;(0) if a AND b are both 1, and 0 if neither a OR b are 1.<br />
<br />
so:<br />
a-----=(00111010)<br />
b-----=(01010111)<br />
aXORb-=(01101101)<br />
<br />
you see now?<br />
<br />
This is applied to all colour chanels and the same to every pixel.<br />
<br />
Notice some things.. <br />
<br />
*if image A and B are the same, the whole screen would be black, <br />
<br />
*two completely different solid colours (different in all r,g and b),  the whole screen would be white.<br />
<br />
*any identicle pixels would be shaded black</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, xor is not just graphics, it is a logic operator just like AND, NOR, OR etc. It can be used in anything.<br />
But i think your friend got that encryption idea wrong, i have also heard of it beign used for this, and i simply assumed that it uses the same binary xor method as mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">AVS Axer</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th April 2003, 15:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, as it often happens, i was wrong.. <br />
i looked at the idea more carefully and youre friend was right shreyas.<br />
One of the outcomes of the xor operation is that it can be inverted easily.<br />
yes, <br />
if x XOR y = z <br />
then y XOR z = x <br />
<br />
so you can decrypt z(the encryption) to get x(the original) so long as you have y (which acts as a sort of mask).<br />
<br />
This applied to avs.<br />
<br />
if you were to XOR blend imageA with imageB, you would get imageC<br />
you could then XOR blend image B with imageC and you would get youre original imageA back!!! wowee... <br />
i didnt know that untill shreyas pointed it out.. very clever, but not very useful...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">About atan2... you got one detail wrong. In a mathematical coordinate system, the angle for (x,y) with regard to the positive x axis is atan(y/x), not atan(x/y).<br />
<br />
By the way, you can imagine atan2 to be the same as this, except that atan2 can also handle the cases where x and/or y is 0:<br />
<br />
alpha=atan(y/x)+below(x,0)*acos(-1);</div></div><hr />

<br />
---------------<br />
binary: sw=1-sw<br />

'sw' will switch from 1 to 0 every time the code is run. Because it is binary, you can use simple maths to get ANY two numbers from this switch: <br />
sw2=sw*(difference between desired numbers)+(lowest desired number)<br />

This converts hue,sat,lum color mode to r,g,b. So you can have more control over your color coding in superscopes. all hue sat and lum values are between 0 and 1. Hue, follows red-&gt; green-&gt; blue in 1/3 sections.<br />
<br />
For all those who dont know, hue is the color, sat is the intensity of that color, and lum is the amount of black(0) or white(1) in that colour.<br />

<div class="posttext">nice work!! few problems with it obviously, cuz its simplifying a complicated process into only a few lines. luminuesence isnt scalar, nor is it dithered between colours correctly. Same deal with saturation. for example, 0 lum should make it black regarless.<br />
all values should be between 0-1, or something else as long as it is finite. And the line 'hue2=hue*tpi' should be just hue*pi.<br />

<div class="posttext">Good to hear from you Atero. I've missed your highly inteligent attempts at abuse for things that have nothing to do with you :)<br />
<br />
Your attempt to inveigle me not to post &quot;randomly&quot; might be founded if they were actually &quot;random&quot;. Odviously resorting to colourful language one may pick up from a seedy back alley where crack cocaine and &quot;Hoes&quot; may be obtained, is a fitting way of showing your dissapreciation for things you don't understand :up:. <br />
<br />
Not to worry I have found an old dusty copy of the &quot;Big ol' fun book of psychiatric experts, ways to help individuals not make fools of themselves .. written by Dr. Phil&quot; which i could post you. A great read which I admit changed my life when I was an abusive, sexually frustrated, introvertedly sadistic egotist myself. There is hope ! moving along..<br />
<br />
N E Way .. I have finnished my work now and I am a free man again. Unleashed from my bindings of the working class. I am once again umonkst the frey of self indulgence to do what ever I please.<br />
<br />
A very interesting thread this one I have seen alot which is of good use to me. <br />

<div class="posttext">i posted this on another thread, and thought it should go here:<br />
<br />
The color fade doesnt use HLS, as this wouldnt really effect the way it fades out at all. It is is tad more complicated, and if you read this you will see why Nullsoft didnt even try to explain it to all the n00bs who download AVS. <br />
<br />
This is what i have worked out: <br />
<br />
The top bar deals with the additive colors, or cyan, magentta and yellow. If it is left of half way across, is timesed by a number between 0 and 1, if more than half way across, it is timesd by a number greater than 1. <br />
Because C,M and Y are comprised of mixes of the base colours (RGB), this method connot make solid cyans etc. Instead, as you increase the slider, the colors apear to lose their base, or their saturation, and eventually fade to white. <br />
<br />
The middle slider deals with the base colours, or Red, Green and Blue. It works in the same way as CMY, by multiplying by 0-1, or 1&gt;. Because it is multiplied, not added, and colours connot excede there maximum potential, the colours dont fade to white. Instead, more to the right you put it, the more the original colours will become solid red, green or blue. <br />
<br />
The last one sort of works with brightness, luminescence, or the amount of 'white' (whichever does it for you). Works with the same multiplication method as above. This is the most 'normal' and useful: This will make the screen either fade to black or white. At a rate depending on how far to the left or right you place the bar. <br />
<br />
A few tips: <br />
the normal fadeout effect can be done by placing all the bars in the same position, and to the left of the center. <br />
<br />
You can avoid the CMY bar doing the fading to white thing by makjing sure the RGB bar is always postioned slightly greater. <br />
<br />
Remember that the sliders do not actually reprisent the colour values, they are multipliers and such. <br />
<br />
If you dont understand the multiplication thingo, it is basically doing this: <br />
if the slider is x units to the left: variable/x <br />
if the slifer is x units to the right: variable*x</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">which is, afaik, not true.  put the top slidebar all the way to the left and you get rgb, put the second slidebar all the way to the left and you get low contrast, fast cycling pallettes.  check out my post in the &quot;Laser?  WTF?&quot; thread</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lets try to keep this thread for tips and tricks about avs and not about how atero has pms and how visag posts random stuff. Really, who cares? And if they do, why? Is there something wrong with their brain that means they have to get pissed off at the slightest fault. Atero, it's not the end of the world if theres one random post. Sometimes random posting is funny. Theres no need to go all anal and be the hitler of the forum. Now... avs...<br />

Oh yeah, nice to see you back visag, try not to provoke him too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">RGB - HSL<br />
<br />
Convert the RBG values to the range 0-1<br />
Example: from the video colors page, colorbar red has R=83%, B=7%, G=7%, or in this scale, R=.83, B=.07, G=.07 <br />
<br />
Find min and max values of R, B, G<br />
In the example, maxcolor = .83, mincolor=.07 <br />
<br />
If the max and min colors are the same (ie the color is some kind of grey), S is defined to be 0, and H is undefined but in programs usually written as 0 <br />
<br />
Otherwise, L = (maxcolor + mincolor)/2 <br />
For the example, L = (.83+.07)/2 = .45 <br />
<br />
Test L. <br />
If L &lt; 0.5, S=(maxcolor-mincolor)/(maxcolor+mincolor)<br />
If L &gt;=0.5, S=(maxcolor-mincolor)/(2.0-maxcolor-mincolor)<br />
For the example, L=0.45 so S=(.83-.07)/(.83+.07) = .84 <br />
<br />
If R=maxcolor, H = (G-B)/(maxcolor-mincolor)<br />
If G=maxcolor, H = 2.0 + (B-R)/(maxcolor-mincolor)<br />
If B=maxcolor, H = 4.0 + (R-G)/(maxcolor-mincolor)<br />
For the example, R=maxcolor so H = (.07-.07)/(.83-.07) = 0 <br />
<br />
To use the scaling shown in the video color page, convert L and S back to percentages, and H into an angle in degrees (ie scale it from 0-360) <br />
<br />
HSL - RGB<br />
If S=0, define R, G, and B all to L <br />
<br />
Otherwise, test L.<br />
If L &lt; 0.5, temp2=L*(1.0+S)<br />
If L &gt;= 0.5, temp2=L+S - L*S<br />
In the colorbar example for colorbar green, H=120, L=52, S=79, so converting to the range 0-1, L=.52, so<br />
temp2=(.52+.79) - (.52*.79) = .899 <br />
<br />
temp1 = 2.0*L - temp2<br />
In the example, temp1 = 2.0*.52 - .899 = .141 <br />
<br />
Convert H to the range 0-1<br />
In the example, H=120/360 = .33 <br />
<br />
For each of R, G, B, compute another temporary value, temp3, as follows:<br />
for R, temp3=H+1.0/3.0<br />
for G, temp3=H<br />
for B, temp3=H-1.0/3.0<br />
if temp3 &lt; 0, temp3 = temp3 + 1.0<br />
In the example, Rtemp3=.33+.33 = .66, Gtemp3=.33, Btemp3=.33-.33=0 <br />
<br />
For each of R, G, B, do the following test:<br />
If 6.0*temp3 &lt; 1, color=temp1+(temp2-temp1)*6.0*temp3<br />
Else if 2.0*temp3 &lt; 1, color=temp2<br />
Else if 3.0*temp3 &lt; 2, color=temp1+(temp2-temp1)*((2.0/3.0)-temp3)*6.0<br />
In the example,<br />
3.0*Rtemp3 &lt; 2 so R=.141+(.899-.141)*((2.0/3.0-.66)*6.0=.141<br />
2.0*Gtemp3 &lt; 1 so G=.899<br />
6.0*Btemp3 &lt; 1 so B=.141+(.899-.141)*6.0*0=.141<br />
<br />
<br />
Scale back to the range 0-100 to use the scaling shown in the video color page<br />
For the example, R=14, G=90, B=14 <br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">hang on,<br />
what use is RGB-HSL if the only time you ever get to specify colours in code form is in the superscope, where you can only use RGB for output.<br />
<br />
also, your HSL-RGB code is exactly the same as given above, only mine was already coded for avs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">whereas your algorithm was compiled (sorta), and shreyas's post explained it in detail.<br />
<br />
and...afaik there is only one hsl/rgb algorithm.  excepting sat={1,0} and lum={1,0}, it's a one-to-one function</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, thats not entirely true, there are many different ways of alligning the hue value to show as loop from 0-1.<br />
It is not neccessarily correct to have red, green or blue in any order, (although it is normally R-G-B). <br />
Also, most methods use sine to 'shape' the scale. The one me and shreyas used doesnt, it just uses linear 1/3's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A simple trick for advanced avsers.<br />
<br />
To shift a scope by pixel.<br />
<br />
X-axis<br />
xt=xt+(#/w)*2<br />
<br />
Y-axis<br />
yt=yt+(#/h)*2<br />
<br />
#=ammount of pixels skipped. 1=none , 0=no movement<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
per frame<br />
xt=xt+(2/w)*2 ;<br />
<br />
per pixel<br />
y=i*2-1 ;<br />
x=if(above(xt,1),-1,xt)<br />
<br />
<br />
This will shift your scope by skipping every other line.<br />
<br />
<br />
|-|-|-|-<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Notice that if you want to skip 2 pixels, you don't use 2 you use 3. A way of &quot;remembering&quot; it is to write it like this:<br />
<br />
xt=xt+(#/w)*2+2/w<br />
<br />
2/w adds the extra pixel, so that what ever number you use in # it will skip that ammount of pixels. Of course it's better to use straight up higher number, but it's just for convenience.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
xt=xt+(3/w)*2+2/w<br />
<br />
Will move the scope like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
|---|---|---|---|---<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice also that shifting per pixel won't work with sin&amp;cos, only when you apply it directly to the scope movement it will work, you can use the if functions to limit the movement of the scope or to make it warp to the otherside once it reaches the end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A very neat trick to darken the colours a little bit.<br />
use an effect list with input replace and outpuit multiply. this will squrare the colours. as rgb are 0....1 then if RGB are not 0 or 1 their squares will be less than the original numbers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Those DMs could use some optimisation. Remember that putting things in if statements means that both results are calculated so for instance:<br />
<br />
x=if(equal(k,k4)+equal(k,k5),abs(x)*col,-abs(x)*col); <br />
<br />
should be<br />
<br />
x=if(equal(k,k4)+equal(k,k5),1,-1)*abs(x)*col; <br />
<br />
one less abs and one less * than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Not necessarily, acos(-1) would return say about 6 decimal places (dont know exaclt), but you can always use a calculator and obtain that value and write pi=3.14159265.. instead of pi=acos(-1)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah and it wouldn't matter one bit :P. For drawing a (-1,1) circle in a 320x320 window:<br />
<br />
r=i*pi*2;<br />
x=cos(r);y=sin(r);<br />
<br />
1 pixel is 2/320 units = 0.00625<br />
<br />
So you only need a precision of 0.003125  (half due to rounding errors) on cos and sin to guarantee a correct result.<br />
<br />
Error-propagation theory says something like:<br />
<br />
relative error of f(x) = (error of x)*(df(x)/dx)<br />
<br />
Because dcos(x)/dx = -sin(x), abs(df(x)/dx) is at most equal to 1. So the relative error of cos(x) will never exceed the relative error on x.<br />
It means that you need at most a relative error of 0.003125 for 100% accuracy in AVS.<br />
<br />
So something like 3.1416 should make no difference from anything more accurate, for drawing circles at least. If you're doing more complicated calculations of course, more accuracy is probably needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well if more accuracy is needed then would acos(-1) or 6167950454/1963319607 be the quickest? I know it doesn't matter much at all but i might as well have the quickest method of doing so.</div></div><hr />

Since it's rand(2) it's clear you want 0&amp;1, so just rnd=above(getosc,0) will do, since getosc can be both negative or positive. It will be either 0 or 1</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good point tug.. and shreyas.. you method is rand(3) (prolly a typo).. rand(3) is either 0, 1 or 2 just like n%3. % is definately useful for this sort of thing in the general case though. (getosc(something)*bignumber)%n is probably the easiest way to generate a synchable rand(n). Sometimes a method like rnd=(largeprime*rnd+smallerprime)%n is more useful... like if you want to generate the same sequence of psuedorandom numbers, for example to create a starfield scope. You can use this per point and start with the same rnd every frame. Sometimes I use this method on beat except the rnd inside the statement is replaced with a var that increments every frame... this tends to give a pretty rectangular distribution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OOlrighty.. nice way of thnking about it is like this.<br />
<br />
n%x = returns the reamainder in real terms. Or, if you prefer, its like &quot;n minus the next lowest mulitple of x, including 0, or the current n if it is a multiple of x.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eg. <br />
x%1 = 0... as 1 divides perfectly into any integer.<br />
1%2 = 1... it divides 0 times, with a remainder of 1.<br />
45%13 = 6... 13 goes into 45, 3 times (39), with a remainder of 6.<br />
<br />
using any form of x%a (such as x%3 in your example) will cycle between 0 and a-1, including all the integers in between (0,1,2,0,1,2,0...). The reason is easy to understand, just follow this.<br />
<br />
0%3 = 0... it divides 0 times, and there is no remainder.<br />
1%3 = 1... it divides 0 times, and there is a remainder of 1.<br />
2%3 = 2... it divides 0 times, and there is a remainder of 2.<br />
3%3 = 0... it divides 1 time, and there is no remainder.<br />
...<br />
40%3 = 1... it divides  13 times, and there is a remainder of 1.<br />
41%3 = 2... it divides  13 times, and there is a remainder of 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
make sense?</div></div><hr />

It's not answered there, though.<br />
Is that what you wanted to say?<br />
Then why don't you say it?<br />
Say : There's a question on page1 that hasn't been answered.<br />

<div class="posttext">/me agrees with sidhartha<br />
For anyone who doesn't understand ths sign(var) function, it returns 1 when var&gt;0 and -1 when var&lt;0 and returns 0 when var=0.<br />
sign(.3)=1;sign(1000)=1;<br />
sign(-.4)=-1;sign(-103)=-1;<br />
sign(0)=0;<br />
I am sure this was mentioned somewere else, but I just finally figured that all out for myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make a greyscale picture that looks like a cloud (I stole a quake3 sky texture and faded out the edges) then make a 3d ssc with an 'n' value of about 10-20, colour it how you like, use the (masked) cloud texture as a texer and tada, easy cool looking fog. <br />
<br />
Looks impressive over raytraced stuff if you sync the ssc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">s-t: actually, no it doesn't.  it tries really hard but it never works.  i used to have a lot of trouble with it cos for some reason it didn't always return the right numbers.  i recently realized (thanks to the help of regwatch) that it returns slightly less than 1 or -1, so this sort of thing happens:<br />
equal(sign(1)*10,10)==0<br />
i don't know exactly how to make it work perfectly, but i do know that if you use abs(x)/x it returns the sign of x correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I've used sine waves to create hue but then you get large portions that are red, green, or blue...  I've also done it with straight interpolation where the values change like this:<br />
<br />
Red:<br />
¯\__/¯<br />
<br />
Green:<br />
/¯¯\__<br />
<br />
Blue:<br />
__/¯¯\<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as lumination goes, you interpolate all the values from (0,0,0) or black, up to the values of your main color, say (1,1,0), and then interpolate the remains up to (1,1,1) or white.<br />
<br />
For saturation you interpolate your color down to (.5,.5,.5) or gray.  I haven't really seen any set rules on how to change colors or anything but this is what I've gathered from the palettes they use in photoshop to let you pick colors.  Obviously you can add a lot more to these if you want.</div></div><hr />

Now copy this Texer2 ~20-30 times, make a couple with smaller images, and you have a firewerk-style!<br />

<div class="posttext">For this, d/l the attached file (Cubic Ligation) (It also includes the txt file)<br />
it is NOT the same thing as the one in the forums. do NOT replace.<br />
<br />
Prerequisite knowledge : SSC knowledge, 3D SSC knowledge, global variables.<br />
<br />
CL is mostly a technical doodle for me, but hey, it turned out sexah :P<br />
It only has two distinct scopes, an assigner and many drones.<br />
By a little coding &quot;magic&quot; I was able to make the cube configure itself when more drones are added... nifty huh? :)<br />
For tutoring purposes, I will assume that you know the &quot;old&quot; avs functions but has no idea on the new stuffs [namely loop(, gmegabuf(, assign(, and exec3(] Unlikely, but ah well. Read and learn. (please? :P)<br />
<br />
/////----------\\\\\<br />
<br />
First, the drones (or mindless cubes in this matter). They're any of the scopes after the comment inside the list.<br />
<br />
The init only has the n value and a remnant from my SSC template (namely pi=acos(-1). Never deleted that for some reason...). The point part only describes the cube, rotations, and using skip for unnecessant points instead of simple blacking out. Nifty to me, but not sure about you - We won't go into that, but tell me if you think I should...<br />
<br />
Anyways, on to the important stuff - The Frame section.<br />
For flexibility, all of the scopes are the same, and yet they correctly fade and resize according to their number. This, people, is the one of the useful uses of global variables.<br />
reg00 is a counter, going by 10s. The first drone increases reg00 by 10 once, so reg00 is 10 for that scope. The second scope adds another 10, so reg00 is 20 for that scope. Once reg00 reaches the last scope, it will pass through the assigner scope again. The assigner does some stuffs with the value and resets reg00 to zero and the cycle starts again. It works like a p-counter in a scope if you've done p2p coding before.<br />
<br />
Next is r. It's just the size of the scope - It's simply the counter times &quot;dif&quot; (more on that when we get to the assigner). This is how the scope adjusts itself to the crowd sizewise ;)<br />
Then there's c1. It creates the bw gradient from the first to last. What is reg08, you ask? It is only the final value of reg00 before it is reset. This way, you can get the upper bound of reg00 and a correct gradient can be made.<br />
<br />
After that is the recall from the global array (gmegabuf). The assigned value counts down instead of counting up, more on that on the assigner section.<br />
So why was the counting done in tens? Well, for easy recalling. The recalled variable is simply the max number minus the current number plus another number. since the former two are counted in tens, there are 10 possible subvalues for each number. The third number is the subvalue number. x-rotation is 1, y-rotation is 2, z-rotation is 3. Quite a bit easier to code than to have clusters dedicated to each rotation to me :)<br />
There's also subvalue #6 in the c1 line - It's the onbeat whiting. Now go back to the point section. Scroll all the way down. As you can see, there's another gmegabuf section. The x-movement is subvalue #4, and the y-movement is subvalue #5.<br />
<br />
After the gmegabuf(s, there's the rotation sines and cosines and the rgb assignment. If you need any tutoring there, you're looking at the wrong place.<br />
<br />
So how does the delay effect happen? That's next, in the assigner.<br />
<br />
(end drone section)<br />
<br />
///-------\\\<br />
<br />
Second, the (pretty huge) [and halfway 1337] assigner. It's the very first scope, if you don't know which one it is.<br />
<br />
First thing that you get to see is what most people are meant to see - dif, the distance variable, and reg51, the aspect ratio. Nothing amazing there.<br />
<br />
Now scroll down past the first comment block, down to reg01. If reg01 is now in the topmost line, you should be able to see the assigns.<br />
This set of assigns (and any further ones that begin a line) are the initial settings of the rotations. The leader cube (smallest, right after the comment) gets to use this value directly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, scroll until the first loop( is at top.<br />
This is the heart of the delay effect (as are the later loops). This follows p2p assigning quite closely. First, there's reg00 as the amount of times it is repeated. A bit of an overkill, but I don't care :P (Seriously though, if you're using loop yourself, use the amount of loops needed plus one just in case. don't be wasteful and lazy like me. please?)<br />
After the amount of loops, there's the exec3. I know that the help file only shows exec2, but exec3 exists. It's a bit like exec2 except that it executes two things before returning the value (of the third stuff).<br />
First is the p-counter, assigned using - surprise surprise - assign(. Just think of the comma as an equal sign.<br />
Second is the delay effect. It takes a certain part of an array and assigns to it the part of the array ten &quot;steps&quot; forward. (one step if you count the units as a subvalue like me). Because the assignment &quot;sweeps&quot; from zero up, the nth unit before the assigned unit needs n passes to be assigned. Since this is calculated per frame, it also takes n frames to be assigned, and so we have our delay effect. Gotta love niftiness.<br />
<br />
A couple lines down is another assigner for x-y movement, then onbeat lighting.<br />
You may notice by now the repeated p=0. Well, p is set to a much higher number at the end of each loop, so it needs to be reset.<br />
Last is a familiar sight - reg00 and reg08/9. As you can see, reg08 is set to reg00 right before reg00 is reset to 0.<br />
<br />
There's the onBeat, nothing special there.<br />
<br />
//////<br />
<br />
And that's... it I guess.<br />
Implement as you will, no direct ripping thank you. Coin me too :p<br />
<br />
Challenge : Fix the delayed start if you wish. It's fixed in the final version ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">In response to the post about 'making squares and circles' I thought I'd write a little something about creating geometry in general, with some example code of course.<br />
<br />
For a start I'll quickly cover the 'point to point' method of creating a wireframe object. The idea is one that I've been using since I came into AVS (remember that dodecahedron anyone?) The basic idea is that you increment a counter every time you draw a point and then use this value with conditional structures to decide what should be drawn for each individual point. Example:<br />
<br />
(Lines SSC)<br />
<br />
init:<br />
// Square<br />
n=5;<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
// Set our point counter to 0<br />
counter = 0;<br />
<br />
// Calculate aspect ratio of AVS display (unimportant)<br />
aspectratio = h/w;<br />
<br />
beat:<br />
&lt;nothing&gt;<br />
<br />
point:<br />
/* <br />
Basically for each point we want to draw we have a section<br />
in this big expresion for x (and also in the later y expression).<br />
For example, when the first point is drawn counter = 0 so the<br />
'first line' sets x = 1 when counter = 0 since 1 is the x coord of<br />
our desired first point for the square. This is repeated for every<br />
possible value of counter until all of the required x-coords have<br />
been assigned. Since nothing is done if counter != 0 for the<br />
'first line' we can add the subsequent expressions without<br />
affecting any of the other points.<br />
*/<br />
<br />
x = 1 * equal(counter,0) <br />
+ 1 * equal(counter,1) <br />
+ -1 * equal(counter,2) <br />
+ -1 * equal(counter,3) <br />
+ 1 * equal(counter,4);<br />
<br />
y = -1 * equal(counter,0) <br />
+ 1 * equal(counter,1) <br />
+ 1 * equal(counter,2) <br />
+ -1 * equal(counter,3) <br />
+ -1 * equal(counter,4);<br />
<br />
// Scale the square so we can see the top and bottom edges (unimportant)<br />
x=x*.5;y=y*.5;<br />
<br />
// Increment the point counter<br />
counter = counter + 1;<br />
<br />
// Correct aspect ratio (unimportant)<br />
x = x* aspectratio;<br />
<br />
(End SSC)<br />
<br />
Note that 5 points are used since AVS needs two points to draw a line so the first line goes from counter=0 to counter=1, the second from counter=1 to counter=2, the third from counter=2 to counter=3 and the final one from counter=3 to counter=4 (which is the same as counter=0 for all intents and purposes). You can optimise and tidy this up a lot, I just made a big mess to make everything as clear as possible.<br />
<br />
This method is great for a lot of objects and can be extended to 3D wireframes pretty easily (see 'Golden Dodecahedron' from Jheriko - Pack VI for an example of this done with a slightly different implementation (ifs instead of equals)). However we can't draw a circle from it or a sphere either.<br />
<br />
When you want to draw curved surfaces in AVS you have to use some maths and typically this can be difficult if you don't already know the answer. Most of us for instance know that x=sin(2*$PI*i);y=cos(2*$PI*i); creates a circle.. but why does this work? Well, you can get this from experimentation (which is how I first figured this out when I started at qbasic.. guesswork) but a much better way is logic. There is no generic way to get an equation for a shape, however some common sense and a good knowledge of maths will help a lot. For instance I can say that <br />
<br />
x=sin(t), y=cos(t)<br />
<br />
is clearly a circle due to the trig identity<br />
<br />
sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2 = 1<br />
<br />
so the hypotenuse of the triangle made by the points (0,0) (x,0) (x,y) is always going to be 1 (draw a diagram if you can't see this), and so this hypotenuse is always going to be the radius of a unit circle about the origin. Make sense?<br />
<br />
Lets assume for a moment that we have no idea about how to make a sphere. It would seem logical that we can somehow extend the circle definition into three dimensions to get a sphere. This infact can be done by using the sin(t)^2+cos(t)^2=1 identity. <br />
<br />
<br />
sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2 = 1<br />
sin(u)^2 + cos(u)^2 = 1<br />
<br />
multiplying these together gives us something which still = 1<br />
<br />
sin(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + cos(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + sin(t)^2 cos(u)^2 + cos(t)^2 cos(u)^2 = 1<br />
<br />
However this has four 'components' so we must eliminate one of them to get something we can equivalate to the x^2+y^2+z^2=1 which defines a unit sphere.<br />
<br />
Noting that sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2 = 1 and combining the last two 'components' together:<br />
<br />
sin(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + cos(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + (sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2)cos(u)^2 = 1<br />
<br />
sin(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + cos(t)^2 sin(u)^2 + cos(u)^2 = 1<br />
<br />
taking each of these components and equivalating them to x^2+y^2+z^2=1 we get <br />
<br />
x=sin(t)sin(u);<br />
y=cos(t)cos(u);<br />
z=cos(u);<br />
<br />
The actual definitions of t and u in code will affect which points are drawn and a simple relation like t=2*u will create a specific curve which looks little like a sphere, using something like t=200*u will create a 'spiral sphere' type shape.<br />
<br />
When trying to make a specific shape when you can't find an equation for it the best approach is to start with what you know about that shape and then exploit that with your mathematical knowledge to create a parameterisation. Another good example would be a torus. The idea I used to make 'Space Torus' in Jheriko - Pack VIII was simply to define a circle with the torus minor radius and shift it along an axis by the major radius then to perform a matrix rotation on this to 'sweep out' a torus. All I had to do was use the appropriate rotation matrix out of the 3D transformation from the SSC to multiply with the existing offset circle definition then to use a second parameter to tell it how much to rotate by rather than using a fixed value every frame.<br />
<br />
Often once you have found a basic shape that works you can modify it too. Playing around with an equation can create interesting effects, sometimes some logical thought process can help here too, for instance the method I described for the torus above can be easily extended to create other shapes by using different rotations or initial shapes, these shapes will often be a lot more interesting because you decided to try it out for some reason... rather than just blundering upon it by random code changes.<br />
<br />
Remember that figuring something out for yourself will often give you a much deeper understanding of it than just 'learning it from a book'.<br />
<br />
If you find it really difficult to come up with your own shapes, or to convert your knowledge of a shape into code, then take a look around the internet on math resourse sites and such, you are bound to find some interesting parametric shapes eventually.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Is there any way to use the effects list override to filter out certain wavelengths of sound, so you only get bass through or treble?<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Mr_Nudge, you could use getspec or getosc for detecting the sound values and then just use the &quot;evallib override&quot; in the effect list. But there is a problem with that, because every song is different and one getosc/getspec setting would detect your desired values on one song and completly something else on some other (if you're even that lucky you manage to find the exact value for those which i highly doubt)<br />
<br />
Perfect or even good bass/beat detection is said to be impossible even with the supercomputers of today :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tug: good beat detection is perfectly possible, but it would require more CPU time. I know, cos I had to make  a good beat detector for a univ project ;).<br />
<br />
My approach: do an FFT per N samples, and calculate the autocorrelation in time of these FFTs. The shift at which the correlation is highest (except of course zero shift) is usually a multiple of the bpm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try using enabled=if(above(getspec(0,.5,0),a),1,0); instead. I used &quot;a&quot; because you can set the treshold if you wish(between 0 and 1). The lower the number, the more often the effect list is enabled.<br />
<br />
What you did wrong was to return 1 when the getspec data is above 1, which is never. I replaced it with 0. Also, you based the data on getspec(1,0.1,0) which looks at a narrow band in the higher pitches.<br />
<br />

blue=red;<br />
<br />
even shorter:<br />
red=assign(green,assign(blue,if(red,red+1/128,0)));<br />
<br />
Color modifiers always have red==green==blue before the &quot;level&quot; section is executed, so if you want a monochrome color modifier (one that does the same to all colors), just modify one color and assign its value to the other colors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A sigmoid is a line curved in two directions like an S. The sigmoid function can be used when you want a movement that starts out slow, speeds up, and then slows down again, e.g., like a plane taking off and landing.<br />
<br />
sigmoid(value,value2)<br />
  = returns sigmoid function value of x='value' ('value2'=constraint)<br />

The larger value2 is, the faster your acceleration, top speed, and deceleration will be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
  Earlier in the thread Tuggummi was musing about the possibilities of animated bitmaps.  This was like maybe 4 or 5 pages ago.  I don't know for sure if anyone offerred a solution.  I found an application called BMP2AVI while browsing a favorite haunt of mine.  It's freeware(yay:)).  Here's the link: http://www.divx-digest.com/software/bmp2avi.html<br />
<br />
Don't even bother trying to check out the homepage, as it seems to have vanished.  However the application can be downloaded via the direct download link(I only downloaded the gui version).<br />
<br />
Maybe with that handy little utility(looks handy, haven't used it yet personally), someone can do some nifty animation that might be a great deal more difficult to code, than to simply draw:)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if it's a useless app.  I mean, I have only just started with AVS(really should stop telling folks that), and so I don't know how well the AVI render works. <br />
<br />
*Fingers Crossed*  I hope it does the trick, you have done some really amazing stuff without animated .bmp so I think with animation you might do still more amazing stuff(or it could turn to rubbish, but if that happened you'd just stop using non-AVS generated animations right?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">cos and sin functions , as most people know, clamp variables between 1 and -1, but the thing is, cos/sin doesn't just flip when in reaches -1 or 1, it slows down, so when it reaches 1 or -1 it is actually at a dead stop and then goes so slow it goes backwards. sin/cos is fine for movement, but not for counters or any other types of timers, because the rate of change will increase as it gets closer to 0 and then start slowing down. Here's a nifty piece of code that keeps the rate of change constant and still clamps between 1 and -1:<br />
<br />
Frame:<br />
a=a+if(equal(a3,0),0.02,if(equal(a3,1),-0.02,a2));<br />
a2=if(above(a,1),assign(a3,1),if(below(a,-1),assign(a3,0),0));<br />
<br />
Pixel;<br />
whatever=a1<br />
<br />
<br />
there you go. a lot longer, but keeps a constant speed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
Wrote a 3d rotation engine powered by Linear Algebra:<br />
<br />
Init:<br />
rx=...; ry=...; rz=...;<br />
<br />
Per Frame:<br />
srx=sin(rx); sry=sin(ry); srz=sin(rz);<br />
crx=cos(rx); cry=cos(ry); crz=cos(rz);<br />
r11=cry*crz; r12=-cry*srz; r13=sry;<br />
r21=srx*sry*crz+crx*srz; r22=-srx*sry*srz+crx*crz; r23=-srx*cry;<br />
r31=-crx*sry*crz+srx*srz; r32=crx*sry*srz+srx*crz; r33=crx*cry;<br />
<br />
Per Point:<br />
x1=...; y1=...; z1=...; //3D object<br />
x2=r11*x1+r12*y1+r13*z1;<br />
y2=r21*x1+r22*y1+r23*z1;<br />
z2=r31*x1+r32*y1+r33*z1;<br />
<br />
The point is to compute the entries of a full rotation matrix in the per frame section (instead of per point rotation). Hope this works faster, haven't tried it yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 2 multiplications faster (per point) that &quot;regular&quot; rotation, but you have to remultiply all matrices if you want to change rotation order, with &quot;regular&quot; method you do not have to do this. Also, this code is much harder to eyeball.<br />
<br />
as in &quot;regular&quot; rotation code i mean regular as in what avsers are using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a trivial effort, and is no harder to do for one method than the other. If you really want to go all out on optimisations combine your matrices and then combine them reversed... once you do it once thats it. Has anyone in here ever derived a rotation matrix from anything other than somebody elses preset? (I know some have... you get the point tho...) So whats wrong with copy pasting that block of code, you save 4 muls per point, not much but I've seen more done for less speed before.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway we could see some new tricks and tips? Gradients are on THE FIRST PAGE. The aspect ratio and rotation matrix have been mentioned literally dozens of times before in these forums (though maybe not on this thread).<br />
<br />
So that I'm not wasting a post... here is a tip:<br />
<br />
About 80% of the time everything else is more expensive than coded components in terms of framerate. If you have 10 effect lists, 3 waters and 2 bumps and your favorite renders are SVP loaders then no amount of code optimisation will speed that preset up.<br />
<br />
One of the most annoying mistakes I see in presets is the use of &lt;insert large number here&gt; components to achieve the effect of 1 or 2, almost always with the result of making the computer strain to draw what is already a really crappy preset. Nothing screams n00b and 'I don't learn from other peoples mistakes, or off my own back' like this particular error. <br />
<br />
I know I have made some really slow presets... but what do they do...  render a blurry bumpy kaleidoscope with a dot fountain in front of it?. Don't think so. When you know basically how AVS works (i.e. that it follows a sequential execution path and that each component takes time to execute) its actually pretty difficult to make a preset that suffers from 'too many bumps', or whatever, by mistake.<br />
<br />
Try to use simple superscopes or simple movments or dms, although its tempting to use water, bump and color map all the time, please don't. All these effects do is give your preset the same tired look as hundreds of others that rely on these effects, and at the same time you are probably wasting framerate, since these sorts of effects can normally be replaced with something reasonably similar that runs a lot faster, using some clever movements, sscs or convo filters, or even just by coding it right in the first place.  Unique tones and colour maps aren't for colouring in superscopes, the red, green and blue variables are!<br />
<br />
[ /rant ]<br />
<br />
edit: 10 points to Mr Nudge on the triangular wave... thats a good tip as many n00bs will go straight for the silly sin approach &lt;cough&gt;WotL&lt;cough&gt;. :p</div></div><hr />

@jheriko: That's all right, undoubtly. But the remaining 20% is for the avs freak creating dozens of rotating superscopes with a not-so-perfect engine, wasting tons of multiplications;)<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Here's what I use for 3D rotation:<br />
<br />
x2=x1*cos(a1)+y1*sin(a1);<br />
y2=-x1*sin(a1)+y1*cos(a1);<br />
x3=x2*cos(a2)+z1*sin(a2);<br />
z2=-x2*sin(a2)+z1*cos(a2);<br />
y3=y2*cos(a3)+z2*sin(a3);<br />
z3=-y2*sin(a3)+z2*cos(a3);<br />
<br />
x1,y1,z1 are the coordinates of the object.<br />
x3,y3,z3 are the final coordinates of the rotated object<br />
x2,y2,z2 are just temporary<br />
a1,a2,a3 are the three angles of rotation (xoy, xoz, yoz)<br />
<br />
Is there any better way to do this? Basically I am using 3 diffrent planar rotations, I couldn't find any good formulas for a 3D rotation.<br />
<br />
Also, this is what I use for 3D transformation, and I think it's the best way, because besides zoom, it's got perspective correction.<br />
<br />
x=((x3*z0)/(z0-z3))/(z0-1);<br />
y=((y3*z0)/(z0-z3))/(z0-1);<br />
<br />
x3,y3,z3 are the object coordinates, z0 is the zoom.<br />
If anyone got an optimisation for this... I'd gladly use it.</div></div><hr />
