      I finally got myself some time again, my exams are almost over. Just one more, physics tomorrow morning. I still had the time to make this though, for people familiar with the show "red dwarf" it's the starbug ship flying through space, for people unaware of that show then i suggest you go watch it, oh and this will just be some weird green ship flying through space.<br />
      <br />
      It's pretty simple right now, the ship, just a few spheres but i might add more detail yet. It's not exactly dull though. Also i figured out how to make a line starfield like the warp drive type thing in star trek, looks pretty sweet.<br />
      <br />
      Comments and suggestions, usual crap always welcome.<br />
      (btw if the texer doesn't show up right it's whacko6_04)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, I know that show!!<br />
      <br />
      Nice. I find it spins a little too fast sometomes though. Said it to poeple before and i'll say it again. I don't like the quick changes in rotation.<br />
      <br />
      Now you realize, you do have to make Red Dwarf itself.</p>

      The bug scope does look rather nifty, but overall the preset didn't just do it for me, it looks a bit too common nowadays. Though i have to admit i like those line stars, but that's because i couldn't do them myself :p<br />
      <br />
      Good preset, but not yippieyaeyea.
