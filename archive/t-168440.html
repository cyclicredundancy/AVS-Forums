      I was thinking of calling my first pack the noob factor, since I'm still a noob here but I'd like to think I don't suck as much as the rest, thus being a factor (no matter how slight) in the AVS community or at least some day will be.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to develop a style that was my own but it just ended us looking sort of like a cross between Les Noobiens and... well, just him I guess. But with a little bit of my flavour thrown in!<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, here's a preview of it, intro+3 new presets. Have fun!</p>
