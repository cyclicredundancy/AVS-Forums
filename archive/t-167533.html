<div class="posttext">i was wondering if anyone had come across a way to play AVS files without using winamp? How about converting the AVS files to EXE files, so that they can each play as standalone.<br />
<br />
would appreciate any leads!<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Play standalone? And how did you imagine sound reaction? Directly from your sound card? Or just have a video of it that someone recorded? That's done already, with UCD's AVSGrabber. For the rest, there ain't any avs .exe files. At least, not as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i dont really care about the audio part, i only want the visuals.<br />
<br />
what i would like to do is create an AVS and then convert it to an EXE (somehow). then I can distribute the exe or even convert it to a SCR file to use as a screensaver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you want to use something other than avs then.  AVS is not a great visualization program - it's a great music-visualization program.  It cannot generate FPS high enough to be a good screensaver or the like.  Find a different program.  AVS is for music - there are far better programs to create similar(yet better and faster) effects than AVS.</div></div><hr />

How much fps do you need?</div></div><hr />

that's how R4 (http://r4.rabidhamster.org/)  does it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know, but it's not gonna work for AVS, seen it's high customisability.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I was under the impression that not all sound cards supported the features required to do that sort of thing (as I recall UnConeD told me this).<br />
<br />
.avs -&gt; .exe converter however ... you gotta be kidding me. Why not learn how to be a real programmer instead of cheating?<br />
<br />
Anyway.. in order to exactly replicate the avs effects in an exe (perhaps fed with random visdata) you would have to use parts of Nullsoft's existing code which would require permission.<br />
<br />
If you want to make demos learn some C++ and do some super leet OpenGL stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I bet someone with the source code to winamp could write something like that. It shouldn't be too hard, just look at how it implements the vis-avs.dll file. I would do it my self, but I don't have access to the source ;)<br />
<br />
Jan: Damn R4 is sweet! If only I had time to learn it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">what about using the docs nullsoft provides? :)<br />
they provide docs on how a vis plugin interacts with the winamp player and vice versa i think, with these docs you could write a replacement for the player, which you would need for a standalone avs-exe. (That's kind of reverse engineering i think... better read the license first ;) )<br />
<br />
if this doesn't work, ask the devs of that foobar2000 wrapper mentioned here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=171038) maybe they can help you with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know that using the vis_avs.dll from another application than Winamp is possible: atomic mp3 can do it if I remember well :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thinks AVS without music is not pretty.<br />
AVS is pretty much with music. Standalone is like as screensaver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd really like to have avs with a minimal music player...<br />
Maybe winamp 2.x?<br />
I don't thrust winamp anymore since its toolbar causes total system crash with ntldr.<br />
I wouldn't give any administrative priviledges to winamp to save .avs files into program files directly. Wouldn't cause i would suspect winamp of messing with my system files and causing another crash XD Only reason why i installed winamp is to use AVS. Told myself... Give it another chance. If i could run AVS by itself, i wouldn't be scared to give it administrative priviledges and have it to save preset files directly in its folder...<br />
Yup, so i'm super agreeing with this 6 years old topic :)<br />
Edit:<br />
Ok :P Was too suspicious XD<br />
Giving winamp administrative priviledges seems to have risen the AVS's speed ability :) :D<br />
And i save time on saving presets... Really, there is a very noticable change in the FPS!! :)<br />
Whish it won't cause a super-heavy system crash for thrusting it XD</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you shouldn't be having to give Winamp admin access when you can change the visualisation directory to one that has normal access rights so the admin aspect isn't required (since i doubt AVS is now going to be fixed to deal with Vista/Win7's handling of the program files folder. the only thing with changing the directory is you have to manually copy things across (or use the mini tool yathosho made -&gt; http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?goto=newpost&amp;t=315969)<br />
<br />
as for the toolbar, no one should be really installing that as it is known to be buggy on certain browsers (plus just clicking next in the installer will always cause issues - same for any other program as well).<br />
