		Can you help me out? I need some assistance like you said. I don't know much on AVS's, don't know how to use the values on the certain things on there like the superscope and etc. Can you help me out? If so, I will be very pleased.

		first, read the FAQ.  it has links to making 3D SSCs and DMs, stuff about math.<br />
<br />
second, download the <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/503123" target="_blank">AVS Primer</a> it also will get you started by teaching you math and stuff.<br />
<br />
once you have a pack nearing completion, post it under AVS Presets.  members will critique you, give you suggestions, sometimes fix stuff for you.<br />
<br />
<b>one word of warning</b> : before you post ANY questions, read the FAQ and search the forums otherwise you will get people mad at you, because it happens all the time.<br />
<br />
i wish you luck in AVSing

		Man, what a waste of my 2000th post, but it looks like it is going to be spent on yelling at n00bs.<br />
Here's what you did wrong:<br />
1. Didn't read FAQ.<br />
2. Didn't search forums.<br />
3. Asked a very vague question.<br />
4. Asked that question to a specific person instead of just PMing them.<br />
<br />
Ask specific questions that haven't already been answered and we will help you out.  If you don't the cat will come along and be very very mad.

		Ummm, advice? Don't use builtin scopes. :)<br />
<br />
They're a decent starting point, but not too impressive. You can do some truly nifty things with a good superscope.<br />

			<strong>tips</strong><br />
		
		

		An alright preset. i used to make such type of presets when i downloaded winamp about 2 years ago ( i may be wrong, because i really dont remember).<br />
tips:<br />
you could have made the builtin ssc morph beetween only 2 colour instead of morphing the same 2 colours 5 times.<br />
instead of usind d=atan(d)*1-b; you can set a variable (suppose t).<br />
then set t=1 in beat and t=t*.2 in frame.<br />
this would make the pumping better.<br />
you can use a starfield for static stars.<br />
if you want to code camera then make ssc stars.

		not too bad, looks like one of my earlier works<br />
<br />
a few things:<br />
t is a variable you have to define yourself, it is useless in Trans / Movements.  It is normally used as a counter in DMs and Superscopes is placed in the frame textbox t=t-.001<br />
<br />
r is not recognized in DDMs, the DDM you used should really be a DM.<br />
<br />
in superscopes, n HAS to be a integer.  it defines the number of points calculated.<br />
<br />
you can only use built in functions r() is not a function.  also, when multiplying you can't do r().  you have to do r*().<br />
<br />
I tweaked this a little, took out the Trans / Movement, and one or two of the superscopes.  tell me what you think

		Michael, don't like that it is a built-in SSC and it has some messed up screen edges.<br />

		that was already covered, so i didn't bring it up again.<br />
<br />
i was tweaking the preset, not making new SSCs for him.  i do agree, however, that built-in sscs look somewhat tacky

		Thanks everyone. The one you gave me Mike, I am giving you full credit, but I am still working on the original. It looks like you are going through space in a quazar now. I will show it again later. Till then, I have to let you guys wait.

		Don't use waterbumps - it can be much nicer if you make a decent DM.  Don't use built in SSC's unless if you can use them extremely well.  Learn to code SSC's and DM's so you can make it more dynamic.

		Ok... Maybe I should remove the waterbump, and remove some other things too. Make it all space type of AVS. Heres one that I submitted though... Might Spiral AVS. I will send a attachment too.

		a little too chaotic.  you still have some movements with 'r()' in them.  this doesn't do anything and renders whatever you are doing useless.<br />
<br />
in dynamic distance modifiers, r is not a variable.  also, don't redefine 'b'.  it shows if there is a beat or not and is very useful that way.
