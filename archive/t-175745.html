      <p class="post-content"><strong>Artist/DJ looking for AVS programmer/writer</strong><br />
      Hey everyone-<br />
      <br />
      I'm currently in search of someone with knowledge of AVS for an installation piece. I would like to learn AVS and be able to script everything myself, but time does not allow me this option right now.<br />
      <br />
      I need an AVS plug-in to accompany a musical piece I will be mixing. I have a few specifications that are priority for the visual aspect and would like to discuss other possiblities with a member willing to work on this project with me.<br />
      <br />
      Please respond here, PM or email me if interested and I can give you all the information regarding this collaboration.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you!</p>

      <p class="post-content">most people recommend reading the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567" target="_blank">AVS FAQ</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=147267" target="_blank">Ateros primer</a> (scroll down for the correct download, dont download the first attachment but the second one)<br />
      The faq answers some questions you'll probably have, and Atero explains all standard effects and the coding in his primer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the links. I had browsed thru the FAQ earlier. I'd rather work with someone with a decent knowledge of AVS rather than kill myself trying to create what I want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well I have a good idea of what I need and it seems to be quite simple, but I'd rather work with someone than try to re-learn math I haven't used in years. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think that somebody can learn AVS with internet.<br />
      You can learn Ateros primer it's easy way to learn creat AVS for begginers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">All I need AVS to do is control the color it produces for one piece of music via tones. So if a 32Hz tone is present, a specific color will appear. Then, each time this tone is played, the color is displayed. The randomization of color needs to be keep to a minimum. Other effects are secondary to this goal.<br />
      <br />
      What I'm trying to do is create a ColorOrgan of my own, using the work of Kandinsky and Sch&#195;&#182;nberg as a starting point. They created paintings to depict musical pieces, I'd like to create a video.<br />
      <br />
      I've heard that a program called Amadeus(sp?) for Mac may allow this control, but I have not found it's PC counterpart.<br />
      <br />
      Any input is much appreciated.</p>
