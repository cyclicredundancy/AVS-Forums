      Ok, people who have seen my presets know that mine tend to be "flashy" and "jerky". At first I pleaded ignorance on this; I have since gone back through all my work and I believe I see what was meant. So, I don't think these are great presets, but I am curious to know if they meet the criteria for "smooth" and non-flashy. Thanks for your input.:)<br />
      <br />
      P.S. - I want to take the time here to say I just went through the forum compilation for the first time. All I can say is WOW. With maybe 2 exceptions (which I won't name) This is the most solid pack i've ever seen! Excellent work, everyone.:up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Smooth and non-flashy, indeed. ;)<br />

      Nirvana is actually a nice preset. Simple, sure, but it looks really good. Warm and cool colors contrast quite a bit, some closer colors might look a bit better, but either way, I still like it. :up:<br />
      <br />
      Wierd Oscilliscope doesn't work. When the effect lists's input blending is set to ignore, nothing in this preset is rendered.<br />
      <br />
      Nevertheless, you've found the "flashy-ness" we were talking about, and undoubtedly fixed it. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you, thank you my friend. You have no idea how happy that makes me. Yes I agree that W. Osc. was kind of weak, but I wasn't sure of the reason. Your input speaks of some of the finer points of the "mechanics" in the effects themselves, which should give me a little more knowledge to work with.:):up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">yep, denkensiefursich is right: you found out what we meant with flashy/flickering etc. and eliminated it all by yourself! Good job! :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Great! Maybe now I can move on to making some real presets. Thanks guys. I think I will scrap my others (not delete them, though of course!) and keep the 3 or 4 really good ones I have to release someday. Thanks again, ^..^ and denkensiefursich.</p>
