      <p class="post-content">You didn't mention how to work it, so I rammed on random keys. There are a lot of changes it can do, some are kinda ugly but a lot are nice. Just so you know, you have a movement of some kind in there and a water effect, don't allow them to run at the same time.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>i mentioned it</strong><br />
      i mentioned it in the comments...<br />
      And i've improved water effects, it prevents now from dissociating colors and keeps his "dilution in liquid" aspect :)<br />
      I also added a star you can control the speed with the keyboard arrows, but it's not sensitive to sound, should it be?<br />
      here is the latest version of it:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice idea. By the way, it's kind of a custom to put the comment before everything else.</p>
