		Notes :<br />
Beat Reactive Color Balls : i kinda like this one, what do you think?<br />
Flickering Neon : this one is going to be one of those &quot;flashy&quot; ones unless your music has a fast beat<br />
The Bubbly Pyscho Sun : i used layered movements and a dynamic movement to try and achieve a &quot;sun bubbling out at you while bouncing back and forth type motion&quot;<br />
Spiral Into Nothing : i really like both this and the bubbly psycho sun presets.... (lol can ya tell i couldn't think of much else to say about this one?)<br />
<br />
ANYWAYS.....<br />
<br />
Feedback?

		There comes a time in every AVSer's life when he/she must realize that the usual built in filters just don't cut it.  That maybe it's time to explore coding, the MANY trans effects, and blending options that comprise the unknown.  Just a thought...

		OK, guys...<br />
i'm trying to be a good avs'er completely without coding stuff, the built ins are just fine, and the possibilities still limitless, so please don't post worthless replies (worthless to me) about how i need to code stuff.<br />
:D

		Ok well then instead of biting my tongue like last time when I looked at your presets...<br />
<br />
The Bubbly Psycho Sun: Colors are awful and it's jerky.<br />
Flickering Neon: After about 3 seconds it looks like it just repeats the same thing over and over.  And the bass spins are extremely bland shapes.<br />
Spiral Into Nothing: Again the colors are awful.<br />
Beat Reactive Color Balls: Again with the colors...  There's no focus in this preset at all.  It looks a bit like you took a hammer to my monitor and then spit on it.<br />
<br />
Now PLEASE reconsider the worth of my post about exploring coding.  AVS was designed with coding in mind and neglecting that is...<br />
<br />
Bah.  What's the point?  Someone else try... :hang:

1. i do not know how to code avs<br />
2. i do not have the math skills such coding requires<br />
3. i am not interested in coding ANYTHING

		The problem is, mainly, that although it is possible to combine the built-in effects to get &quot;passable&quot; results, anything beyond &quot;passable&quot; tends to require a certain amount of programming and math knowledge.<br />
<br />
After all, the best presets out there don't just have built-in effects stuck together like legos. When you use your own code to customize a Superscope or Dynamic Movement or Texer II, you can sculpt something that is truly unique, truly distinctive, and truly artistic.<br />
<br />
This can be the most powerful and versatile feature of AVS, and it's one that I strongly recommend exploring, especially if you want to be taken seriously as an AVS artist.<br />
<br />
Now, that said...<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat Reactive Color-Balls&quot; isn't that bad. I consider it the best of the four. (Even though I've seen it before.) Its main weakness is that it's obvious how it was done. Also, nearly everything interesting that can be done with a Moving Particle has already been done to death. I call that &quot;The Curse of the Moving Particle&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flickering Neon&quot; could use less flicker and more neon. Otherwise, it's a little plain but okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spiral Into Nothing&quot;... I consider this the worst of the set. It looks like the same pattern of water drops repeating over and over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Bubbly Psycho Sun&quot; is also interesting. I think I'd like it more if it had more variety in the colors, though.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think you've done a pretty good job of managing &quot;passable&quot; with the built-in effects. There isn't much that's particularly special about these, but, with some more practice and experimentation, you may yet come up with something impressive in the future.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

It above all requires an effort on the part of the person making the preset, which will not come from someone who is in the habit of having things done for them.

		Yeah, I thought you meant like make super dee duper APEs that do lots of things for you, not like making interesting SSC's and exploiting effects. Effort is a must, definitely.
