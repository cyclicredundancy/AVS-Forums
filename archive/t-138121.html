      <p class="post-content"><strong>Desaturization filter kinda thingey.</strong><br />
      Don't know where to put this, honestly...tips/tricks, wishlist, presets...basically this is a preset that demonstrates a desaturation filter I made a couple days ago. It tones a pixel towards the average of it's three color channels. No, it is NOT the same as a utone (which uses the maximum of the three color channels), or a brightness-filter colormap (uses the log (?) of the average). The only problem is it's SLOW AS HELL due to all the effect lists and adjustable blends :p<br />
      So this is a poke at UnConeD to add an average keying to Colormap, instead of that Brightness key (which, as far as I can tell, is rather pointless in the first place because it seems to ignore a large portion from anything between light gray to white). Hence I don't know where to put it :D<br />
      <br />
      And that DM rocks, I don't care what you say, it just does. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice. It goes faster if you set the filter's colourmaps to (0,0,0)...(83,83,83) and then additive.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Siddhartha, turn off the chrome filter and you won't have that problem. :rolleyes:<br />
      Zeven: Thanks for the tip, hadn't thought of that one. Updated. (Note: In the first one the blue channel wasn't weighted right. It's adjustable blend should've been set to 83, it was set to 64.)<br />
      <br />
      It still sucks AVS like rabid monkeys without a cause, though...and I don't think there's any better way to get around it (read: without buffer saves and too many effect lists). Ho hum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Except for how it doesn't, and it's not?<br />
      <br />
      The second one doesn't show it off very well, I was trying to make the color saturation dynamic this time...get rid of the last DM and fiddle with the adjustable blend on the last effect list....</p>
