<div class="posttext">this is my first try at avs presets...i dont even know what i have done...but anyway if you like them please tell me along with some tips.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice work, you've managed to fill the whole srceen with most of them, which is a good thing, t's what makes presets look good - there's nothing more boring than a black background with some random stuff ontop of it that only fills a tiny spot in the center. Try using more inverts, unique tones and get some thicker lines. That's another thing that makes presets look good - thick lines. With superscopes if you have it set to draws as lines not dots put &quot;linesize=5;&quot; in the per point box - it'll make it look much better. Also, try to slow your presets down(not in fps terms) but get slower and more fluid movement and things will start looking good. So learn to code dynamoves and ssc's, use more colour modifying trans and you'll be set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks for your comments...but i would like to know how i can learn this avs language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The same way i did - experiment.<br />
Start with basic dynamic movements and work your way up.<br />
<br />
Heres a short tutorial for dms:<br />
<br />
With your dm's there are two types of equations: rectangular coordinates (x&amp;y values) and polar coordinates (D(degrees)&amp;R(radians)). I find x&amp;y is much easier to use if you just want a simple movement like having you picture scroll up and then back down again-like looking at tiles really close up and moving your head up and down.<br />
To do this you need movement along your y-axis.<br />
<br />
First of all if your dm's going to work you'll need something to be rendered. Put in a trans&gt;interleave into a blank avs with clear every frame on. Drag both sliders to the middle and make the colour any colour other than black (so you can see it). You should have a kind of grid on your screen.<br />
<br />
Now to make the DM:<br />
Place a trans&gt;dynamic movement after your dot grid.<br />
Select reccoords and wrap.<br />
For this dm we won't need anything in the init box, so leave it blank.<br />
In frame, write a=a-0.02 - this means the variable &quot;a&quot; will start at 0 and decrease by 0.02 every frame.<br />
You can have any letter you want as a variable &quot;a&quot; is just an example. The only letters you can't use are: x&amp;y, d&amp;r and b which equals 1 when a beat occurs and 0 when there is no beat.<br />
We won't use the Beat box yet so leave that blank for now.<br />
In the point box is where most of the code for your dm goes. Before we start with the point box you first need to know how sin() and cos() work in avs. They basically clamp any changing variable (in our case &quot;a&quot;) between -1 and +1.<br />
So the term cos(a) will casue &quot;a&quot; to decrease to -1 and then change to a=a+0.02 and &quot;a&quot; will increase untill it reaches +1 then flip again.<br />
So in you point box type y=y-cos(a) - this will cause y to decrase by cos(a), which results in the immage of your dot grid rising and falling due to &quot;a&quot; changing from - to +.<br />
If you want the grid to sccroll up and not change directions, remove cos() so it reads y=y-a - this means a will not flip and just continue decreasing to infinity.<br />
(i hope you understand me up to here)<br />
Because sin() and cos() work together, you can use them to create smooth curved motion - like a circle.<br />
To make circular motion you need to add an x value.<br />
At the end of every expression eg. y=y+a-c you need to place a &quot;;&quot; to tell AVS where one expression starts and another begin.<br />
So after y=y-cos(a); write x=x-sin(a)<br />
This will result in circular motion.<br />
<br />
Now to add some music response we will use the beat box.<br />
The beat box executes the code you have written every time a beat is detected. If we wrote a=a-0.02 in the beat box instead, &quot;a&quot; will decrease by 0.02 every time a beat is detected, not every frame. Keep a=a-0.02 in the frame box and write a=a-(rand(100)/100) in the beat box - this will make a decrease by a random value between 0 and 100 /100 so anywhere between 0.00 and 10.00 eg: 5.23.<br />
This will give your grid a random speed burst every time a beat is detected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Onto D &amp; R:<br />
I like to think of R as rotation.<br />
Make a new dm after your first one and turn rectcoords off but keep wrap on. Set your grid size to 0x0!<br />
Write a=a-0.02 again in the frame box.<br />
In point write r=r-a;. YaY, now it's spinning!<br />
Remember to end r=r-a with a ; .<br />
After r=r-a; write d=d+cos(a) - now it's zooming in and out.<br />
In this case we must use either cos() or sin() or else it will keep zooming in or out forever.<br />
<br />
And the rest is experimenting. Have fun!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In the above post :<br />
if you want a random number 0..10 you would need to use this instead<br />
rand(100)/10;<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
rand(1000)/100; // which is what I think he wanted<br />
<br />
;) <br />
probably a typo, but we don't need to confuse him now, eh?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey guys thanks for all the help...but i dont seem to have trans&gt;dynamic movement..i have only movement. HOW CAN I DOWNLOAD THAT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What version of Winamp are you using?<br />
I think version 5.05 has it when installed.<br />
If you don't have it, download the new version of winamp.</div></div><hr />

In the future however, you might want to save yourself some time and just point people to FAQ #7 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th September 2004, 08:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">how  many times to you see people posting questions that have been answered in the FAQ - a lot. It's obvious that people don't read the FAQ as much as they should.<br />
Anyway it opened my eyes a bit in the making.</div></div><hr />
