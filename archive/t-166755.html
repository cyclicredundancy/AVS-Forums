<div class="posttext">Okay I got a problem with synchronizing these two superscopes. I'm trying to 3D illusion them so that they more or less follow each other like a sandwich. <br />
<br />
I can get them to do exactly what the other one does, but I can't get them to remain parallel--they end up clipping each other. I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the depth of the illusion, but I don't know the practical fix.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I haven't written good scripts for this (this is the first 3D illusion I made, I kinda found it out by mistake) so if you want to point out the slow stuff and the solution I'm missing I'd really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
-----[edit]-----<br />
Actually, I can get them to remain parallel, but I can't get the points equidistant. That's what I really want to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What he is saying is using the conversion formulas so it is in &quot;real&quot; 3D, with correct depth and rotation.  It makes it a *lot* easier  to do and debug the code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Why not just do real 3D? <br />
<br />
He has a point, consider that once you get to more complex shapes using an illusion will get harder and harder until it's almost impossible.  Plus,  3D code is a lot easier to understand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Umm...El-vis's 2D&gt;3D conversions are not as fast as other ones.  It requires a lot more conversions because to works with degrees, not radians.  See the tips and tricks thread for another one.</div></div><hr />

What are conversion formulas?<br />

Thanks, fragmer and pow(m,2)k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow, 'real' 3D is hella easier. I've been using El-Vis' guide. I still don't get all the math. But I see what you mean about how it's more easier to manipulate. That was always my problem when trying to do 3D SSC's.<br />
<br />
Are the conversion formulas those lines that basically turn x,y and z into x and y? <br />
<br />
I still have yet to check out the faster one in the tips &amp; tricks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hehe.... PLZ dont start useing el-vis 3D<br />
And I do reccomend you to better learn how the 'real 3d' works, its not that hard anywyas, just do some googling for &quot;3D math&quot; or &quot;3d math&quot; + rotation or something like this<br />
<br />
check out 3D base i use, it doesnt work using angles, but uses the position of camera in 3d space<br />
oh yea, object code might be hard, but just ignore it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I fully intend to, Jaak. It's just I'm very new to all this stuff if you can't tell. Hell, figuring out how to synch things using getosc(n,n,n) was a big breakthrough to me. :eek: <br />
<br />
Using El-Vis' 3D helped me see how my scripts suck for plugging in values. Although, I was working on it. The 3D math I'm sure isn't a problem to learn. <br />
<br />
Your reply is probably the most helpful so far to tell you the truth. No offense to everyone else, but I want to learn what it means, not just how to fill in the boxes for what seem like arbitrary reasons on the surface to the uninitiated. And El-Vis explanation was pretty dry. <br />
<br />
But, I can't look at the file you've uploaded. Is it compressed in some format that I don't know or something? <br />
<br />
Thanks, guys. <br />
<br />
Sometimes you just gotta beat a rock for a couple days to get some blood out of it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, i wanted too to learn what the conversion formulas actually do, but i got tired of trying to understand it. To me it's enough to know that there isn't much of another way to do it ;) (so you can't actually make your &quot;own&quot; 3D rotation formula)<br />
<br />
<br />
btw. why didn't any of these experts mention global variables? With them you can easily sync scopes.<br />
<br />
example to sync two lines moving up &amp; down.<br />
<br />
scope1<br />
<br />
per frame<br />
<br />
reg00=reg00+tb ;<br />
st=sin(reg00)*0.25 ;<br />
<br />
per beat<br />
tb=(rand(101)-50)*0.002<br />
<br />
per pixel<br />
<br />
x=i*2-1 ;<br />
y=v*0.25+st+0.5<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
scope2<br />
<br />
per frame<br />
<br />
st=sin(reg00)*0.25 ;<br />
<br />
per pixel<br />
<br />
x=i*2-1 ;<br />
y=v*0.25+st-0.5<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, once you define a global variable in one component that is codable (let be then bump, dynamic movement, superscope, movement, dynamic shift or dynamic distance modifier) you can use it on other components as well and it will have the same value in the them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hehe.... PLZ dont start useing el-vis 3D <br />
<br />
<br />
I know this isn't the correct thread for this, but I have some doubts as to what El-vis knew about optimization.<br />
<br />
<br />
x=x4/(1+z4/dst);y=y4/(1+z4/dst)<br />
<br />
<br />
The part I don't get is the division by the variable named &quot;dst&quot;.  It really isn't necessary, and it shows when you use scopes with a high N value.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">augh.<br />
<br />
i seriously recommend you DON'T go looking at el's &quot;tutorial&quot; because it's slow and leads to a lot of misconceptions about rotation/translation.  eventually I'll get the second portion of my avs primer out, which will deal with this sort of thing properly.  but for now i suggest you talk to your math teacher about rotation matrices....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lots to read here and ponder. <br />
<br />
And as for U, UIUC85, I guess you aren't a jackass, I was just being insolent. <br />
<br />
Atero, I don't have a math teacher. I'm a philosophy major (I like unemployment). Hell, I can barely do long division on a good day. I just like math in the same way I like physics. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for everyone's input. I'll study it all when I get a break from the workload this semester. Incidentally, I have to do a project now for Intro Computer Science (one of my few sciences) which *is* just plugging someone elses values into Excel. Jeebus, save me.</div></div><hr />
