      One of the transitions has screen devideing up into 9 squares. imagine 9 different presets.. 1 in each of the 9 squares &gt;&gt;then going step further imagine being able to play all different 9 presets on 9 different monitors all jammin to same tune... I know it nuts but an idea that someone might do something with someday:weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">any number would do... just went with 9 because of the 9 squares in transitions/// main idea is to play different visualizations on different monitors with same music source, I would set different folder for each monitor so they all could change presets and not same one all day</p>

      <p class="post-content">One computer cannot do 9 presets at a standable speed. Even if all of the presets normally run at high speeds, with 9 presets, you would get crap - especially if each of them are supposed to be able to run at a resolution high enough for a monitor. You can do multiple presets, but I wouldn't reccommend it. If you search the forums you can figure out how - it has to do with opening multiple instances of AVS.<br />
      <br />
      You can synchronize multiple winamps on multiple computers and then have each computer running a different preset and have the same thing happen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could do a 9 in 1 preset. Just use multiple movements for placement + additive blend.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're right, that is absolutly crazy idea. Were having troubles to run avs on a sinlge machine with a single window with decent framerates, and you want <b>9</b> windows?! :igor:<br />
      <br />
      That's mad! Cubit technology will be invented before you can do that in avs :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">kind thought it was nuts but put it out there just in case I wasn't the only one with such ideas.one of the uses for muliple displays would be if (another crazy idea)winamp would give us a 6 source(instead of 3) sound (for a 5.1 surround)and we could make a seperate preset set for sound from each speaker and make different presets for each speaker. just thought it would be so super cool if it was possible even though I'll probablly never see it in my lifetime</p>
