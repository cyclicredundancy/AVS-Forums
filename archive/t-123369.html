<div class="posttext">I believe this is what the fullscreen overlay mode is for. Also I think this question has been answered before. Try searching the Forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">With most modern graphics cards, whenever you have overlay mode on, this is mirrored on the second display (commonly referred to as &quot;Overlay mirroring&quot; or &quot;Theater mode&quot;). Rather than using fullscreen overlay mode, you <br />
should be able to get the same result by checking the &quot;overlay mode&quot; box in AVS' display properties (set desktop to color isn't even needed).<br />
If this doesn't work, try fullscreen overlay mode and/or fiddle with the settings of your videocard in display properties (be careful though).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Alright, while we are on this topic...<br />
Whenever I try to use overlay I have to keep my display properties window open or else the overlay won't work.  Also, I can't change the avs window size either without messing it up.  I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4600 and I am using my television as a second monitor.  Any ideas why it won't work.  Oh and I did search the forums, but nothing was related to this particular problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try updating your drivers to the latest version...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well allright then, im just gonna go for it,  if i have any hassle i may just end up filling a folder with stuff and let it cycle thru its contents randomly. this leads me to another q. who doesn't want me to use their presets? you guys all have some really sweet stuff out there and all i can offer in return is some pics of the set if it all works out. thanks in advance. wish me luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have been some threads before (&quot;people using your stuff and getting paid&quot; is one I remember by title) and the general consensus is that showing people's   presets in public is great, even without compensation. After all, we publish them here without compensation too.<br />
Pictures will be very much appreciated, so take a lot of em (one per artist minimum :cool:) and post them here. You should probably have your own webspace for that though, because these forums have attachment size-limits.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if you could include the occasional artist's name on screen (intro presets are pretty good for this).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, as long as you in no way claim credit for our presets, most of us don't mind.<br />
And UCD, my drivers are current. Any other idea why it won't work?<br />
<br />
<br />
I finally was able to figure out what was wrong with it.  I had forgotten to install the new drivers(I thought I had, but apparently not).</div></div><hr />
