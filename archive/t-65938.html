      <p class="post-content"><strong>Full Screen AVS at different Color Depths</strong><br />
      Hey Everyone:<br />
      <br />
      I have done an experiment with screen resolutions and color depths on the effect of frame rates of Winamp's (version 2.77) bundled AVS visualizations in full screen mode.<br />
      <br />
      My computer has a 750 Mhz Athlon CPU, 160MB of PC100 RAM, a Sound Blaster 16 PCI sound card, and a 3dfx Voodoo4 4500 AGP video card. I used the Marco - katmanduCommercial1 visualization on a certain song from the same point in the song. I expected to get better frame rates for every resolution by using 16-bit color. Instead, I got better frame rates at 32-bit color. This is perplexing, since theoretically there is more video data to process at 32-bit color. My only explanation is that the visualizations are programmed in 32-bit color and the video card must downsample the picture to achieve 16-bit color. Could anyone shed some light on this?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks...</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS does not use hardware acceleration, None. Make sure the options are the same with 32 bit color, there are a lot of options in AVS</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Logical</strong><br />
      Actually it's very logical if you know the how's and why's.<br />
      <br />
      In 32-bit color, only 24-bits are used for colour: one byte red, one byte green and one byte blue. The remaining byte is not used, but it does make it so that every pixel spans exactly 32-bits, which is exactly the size of the cpu datapaths and registers since a 386.<br />
      <br />
      In 16-bit color, all bits are used: 5 bits red, 6 bits green and 5 bits blue. The channels are mixed across the 2 bytes.<br />
      <br />
      Now because 32-bit has each channel in a separate byte, it's easy to extract them and perform operations on them. In 16-bit color, the channels have to be bitmasked and shifted out before operations can be done, and they have to be put back together afterwards.<br />
      <br />
      In 3D hardware acceleration this is no problem, because the designer can do the operations needed for 16-bit color freely in the hardware design. In software mode though, on a 32-bit CPU, it's a lot easier and faster to go for 32-bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>And...</strong><br />
      And to confirm your suspicion, yes the AVS effects are all coded in 32-bit (if you look at the APE API you'll notice this). But my explanation might shed some light on other cases where 32-bit is faster than 16-bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Thank You</strong><br />
      Many thanks to everyone who replied. That certainly shed some light on this.</p>
