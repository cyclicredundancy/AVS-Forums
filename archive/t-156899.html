      <p class="post-content"><strong>Brightness by Resolution?</strong><br />
      Just wondering, i have this background flow &amp; pattern that uses additive blending scope and very small values for color (24 for each channel). The problem is that it looks correct &amp; "full" in my screen size and some small fullscreen sizes (320x240), but higher resolutions tend to be a bit emptier looking, now this can be fixed if i change the brightness of the scope a bit larger.<br />
      <br />
      What i just need to know is that would there be any point at trying to make the brightness of the scope depend on the screen size with W &amp; H. Could there be any problems? Should i just use Width or just Height, or both of them? What about if the resolution the user is using is smaller than mine?<br />
      <br />
      Is there any point at it at all, or should i just stick to the static value and pray that the viewer uses a correct res?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, ive never done it to control brightness, but ive used similar ideas before. Just multiplying everything by w*h*0.001 or somthing.<br />
      <br />
      If you were afraid of people using too big or too small res's then just cap the result with min and max's.<br />
      <br />
      eg: brightness=min(max(brightness*w*h*0.001,0.2),0.8)<br />
      <br />
      of course you would do as much as you can of that in /frame.<br />
      <br />
      i hope this is at all what you were talking about.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, that's basicly what i mean. Im just wondering will it work on every setting...<br />
      <br />
      I was thinking about 5 minutes later when i posted this a method like this:<br />
      bright=(w/mywidth+h/myheight)*halfofthecurrentbrightness<br />
      <br />
      Im guessing this would compare the the users height to my height and same with the width then just multiply that with half-of-the-current-brightness.<br />
      <br />
      hmm... i'll have to test this.<br />
      <br />
      But if there is something utterly wrong with this whole idea, please let me know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The brightness is affected by the area, so you need to multiply w and h, not sum them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try min(h,w)? The reason for this is to keep the aspect correct, so that if you change the aspect you dont get problems.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Then it'd be sqr(min(h,w))..</p>
