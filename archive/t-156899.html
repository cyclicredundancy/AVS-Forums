<div class="posttext">Just wondering, i have this background flow &amp; pattern that uses additive blending scope and very small values for color (24 for each channel). The problem is that it looks correct &amp; &quot;full&quot; in my screen size and some small fullscreen sizes (320x240), but higher resolutions tend to be a bit emptier looking, now this can be fixed if i change the brightness of the scope a bit larger.<br />
<br />
What i just need to know is that would there be any point at trying to make the brightness of the scope depend on the screen size with W &amp; H. Could there be any problems? Should i just use Width or just Height, or both of them? What about if the resolution the user is using is smaller than mine?<br />
<br />
Is there any point at it at all, or should i just stick to the static value and pray that the viewer uses a correct res?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, ive never done it to control brightness, but ive used similar ideas before. Just multiplying everything by w*h*0.001 or somthing.<br />
<br />
If you were afraid of people using too big or too small res's then just cap the result with min and max's.<br />
<br />
eg: brightness=min(max(brightness*w*h*0.001,0.2),0.8)<br />
<br />
of course you would do as much as you can of that in /frame.<br />
<br />
i hope this is at all what you were talking about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, that's basicly what i mean. Im just wondering will it work on every setting...<br />
<br />
I was thinking about 5 minutes later when i posted this a method like this:<br />
bright=(w/mywidth+h/myheight)*halfofthecurrentbrightness<br />
<br />
Im guessing this would compare the the users height to my height and same with the width then just multiply that with half-of-the-current-brightness.<br />
<br />
hmm... i'll have to test this.<br />
<br />
But if there is something utterly wrong with this whole idea, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The brightness is affected by the area, so you need to multiply w and h, not sum them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Try min(h,w)? The reason for this is to keep the aspect correct, so that if you change the aspect you dont get problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Then it'd be sqr(min(h,w))..</div></div><hr />
