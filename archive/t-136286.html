<div class="posttext">I was poking around in vis_avs.dll with Resource Hacker...and I found the display dialog there...except there was a section on the bottom called Laser.<br />
<br />
Does this appear normally in anybody's AVS?<br />
<br />
<br />
I searched the plugins section, but there was no 'Laser' addon I could find.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hah. Never went to look in there, but it's definitely there.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to do anything do. Made an APE to show all hidden stuff (add to preset, then go into Display options).<br />
<br />
Perhaps they used it for a custom version of AVS and left it in hidden so they could keep the same resource files for both builds?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now I have and Idea. Why not use resource hacker to change the dialog of color fade. Add what the sliders are meant for. Can it be done. I will try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, using a hex editor, you have to be careful to keep strings the same length, otherwise wacky things start happening. But I think res editors keep the pointers and stuff working. So it may be possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not sure what am I supposed to be right now - happy or mad?<br />
On one side, there's actual development on AVS (and new components - possible that SSC is revamped)... CD-Audio support added...<br />
As for the mad side, let's just say there's a lot of complaints going around in my head...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have done lots of things the the .dll file. Just add a label stating the color fade options. I think they stand for hue, lum and sat (I am not sure, very doubtful)<br />
But can the updated version be released? That would'nt violate the laws, would it?<br />

The color fade doesnt use HLS, as this wouldnt really effect the way it fades out at all. It is is tad more complicated, and if you read this you will see why Nullsoft didnt even try to explain it to all the n00bs who download AVS.<br />
<br />
This is what i have worked out:<br />
<br />
The top bar deals with the additive colors, or cyan, magentta and yellow. If it is left of half way across, is timesed by a number between 0 and 1, if more than half way across, it is timesd by a number greater than 1. <br />
Because C,M and Y are comprised of mixes of the base colours (RGB), this method connot make solid cyans etc. Instead, as you increase the slider, the colors apear to lose their base, or their saturation, and eventually fade to white.<br />
<br />
The middle slider deals with the base colours, or Red, Green and Blue. It works in the same way as CMY, by multiplying by 0-1, or 1&gt;. Because it is multiplied, not added, and colours connot excede there maximum potential, the colours dont fade to white. Instead, more to the right you put it, the more the original colours will become solid red, green or blue.<br />
<br />
The last one sort of works with brightness, luminescence, or the amount of 'white' (whichever does it for you). Works with the same multiplication method as above. This is the most 'normal' and useful: This will make the screen either fade to black or white. At a rate depending on how far to the left or right you place the bar.<br />
<br />
A few tips: <br />
the normal fadeout effect can be done by placing all the bars in the same position, and to the left of the center.<br />
<br />
You can avoid the CMY bar doing the fading to white thing by makjing sure the RGB bar is always postioned slightly greater.<br />
<br />
Remember that the sliders do not actually reprisent the colour values, they are multipliers and such.<br />
<br />
If you dont understand the multiplication thingo, it is basically doing this: <br />
if the slider is x units to the left: variable/x<br />
if the slifer is x units to the right: variable*x<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Trans / Colorfade<br />
   Technically, it changes the HSL values in a pre-determined fasion.<br />
   The algorithm can be tweaked using the three slidebars.  Their<br />
   function is extremely mysterious, and it takes a little experience to<br />
   get out of it what you want, but overall it is an extremely useful<br />
   way to make semi-cyclic color pallettes without too much effort<br />
   involved.<br />
<br />
   If anyone knows exactly what this does, please e-mail me at:<br />
   therealatero@hotmail.com.<br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<br />
   Normal colorfade (first three slidebars)<br />
      The first slidebar controls the evolution of hue towards the primary<br />
      colors red, green, and blue (on the left) or towards the secondary<br />
      colors cyan, magenta, and yellow (on the right).<br />
      The second slidebar controls the evolution of saturation towards<br />
      grayscale - low saturation - on the left, or pure color - high<br />
      saturation - on the right.<br />
      The third slidebar controls the evolution of luminosity towards<br />
      black - low luminosity - on the left, and white - high luminosity - on<br />
      the right.<br />
<br />
   OnBeat change (last three slidebars)<br />
      This changes the colorfading temporarily every beat, but it also<br />
      affects the normal colorfade in ways that I cannot yet explain, so<br />
      be careful using it.  Apparantly, it is active even when there isn't a<br />
      beat.<br />
<br />
   OnBeat randomize<br />
      This *permanently* randomizes the colorfade settings every beat.<br />
      Thus using this function makes tweaking the normal colorfade<br />
      pointless<br />
<br />
<br />
This can all be quite confusing, considering the first two slidebars<br />
work simply - changing the saturation and luminosity values linearly -<br />
however the first one has a more complicated function.  Just<br />
remember: you'll get used to it eventually.  Don't just give up because<br />
you can't figure it out :)<br />

Could you pleeease Pm me on the details of the program you used for the text boxes modifications I have been looking for something like that for ages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">sigh.. can you actually read my posts..<br />
the first bar deals with CMY strictly..<br />
if you put it to the left, these colours are decreased, so the colours are bound gradually back to pure RGB's.<br />
Saturation does not have anything todo with it being a pure cooour or not. For example, if you have it on max saturation, it wont result in pure RGB, it will result in white.<br />
You can imagine that if the first slider is all the way to the left, and the second is all the way to the right, and the last one centered. The coluors will be ALMOST pur RGB.<br />
<br />
Test it with clear every frame and a nice arangment of colours on screen and youll see what im talking about.<br />
<br />
Also, the first two sliders are not linear:<br />
The normal effect is having all three in the middle, left is detrimental, right is augmentive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">play around with this:<br />
<br />
oh, and the on beat random works like this:<br />
it picks the random mode on beat, jumps to it immediatly, and then slowly fades each hypothetical slider back to the position governed by the top bars. <br />
The same deal goes for normal on beat mode, exept that no randomising is done, and the on beat mode is specified by the bars on the bottom.<br />
So it does matter what you have in the top three bars no matter what mode you select.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i read your post.  it was wrong.  hence my posting.  got it?<br />
<br />
the first bar does NOT deal with solely CMY, it sets a fade towards the base or secondary colors.  if your post were correct then putting the top bar all the way to the right would be the same as putting the middle bar all the way to the left.</div></div><hr />
