      <p class="post-content">Very good scopes. As for the Elvis engine, I don't know much about the math. But I took a look at it a few days ago and noticed that the division by dst doesn't look necessary. It shows when you are using high n scopes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The best 3D code is your own - try searching online to learn how to do it, and then write it yourself. When you really get to understand the complete mechanics of the 3D transformations, then you will have a lot more power with the coding. You will be able to make certain optimizations in some cases, etc, as well as just being able to do new stuff - like 4dimensions, for example.</p>
