<div class="posttext">Maybe I am just getting older but I thought most of the presets were kinda bright and jittery.   I made a softer blending preset. Tell me what you all think.  Yes, it is version 8.3 It took a while to design something the way I wanted.<br />
<br />
My personal favorite way to view this is visualization is at 640*480*32 about 24 frames per second, I turn down the performance till I get around there.<br />
<br />
If anyone likes it make sure you say something =)<br />

<div class="posttext">I can't check this out because I am at work at the moment, but, for future reference, AVS presets should be posted in the AVS presets forum rather than the main AVS forum.<br />
<br />
Judging from the screenshot there is a starfield with water and some other effects? I could be wrong and it might be some awesome 3D explosion effect... I might check it out when I get home.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ahh missed the AVS preset forum, LOL there are so many forums =) If a mod would like to move it, I would appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Someone will probably tidy it up... don't worry lots of people make the same mistake.<br />
<br />
At least you didn't ask how to stop AVS presets randomly changing every 30 seconds. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">An old style preset.<br />
I think too many Additive blending is destroying the depth of color. And looks kinda unfinished to me. A really flow-DM and convo-glow would be nice additions.<br />
Try a little harder my friend!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The additive blending is the only source of color =) The colors I am using are standard RGB at almost black levels, and  gray at almost black. But there was a extrainious setting in there, which was causing it to be a little to bright. That has been fixed in 8.4</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok... I made a quick fix (actually a remix of my taste). If you wish, I can attach the file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tooblai</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th December 2006, 15:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Here it is. A bit different from your taste I can say :D.<br />
But now it has a better contrast/brightness and lot faster than before. Try it with high resolution and loud songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Profit0004</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th December 2006, 15:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">While I do agree the bightness and contrast are much higher, I was going for soft tones, and a smooth blending =)  AS for the speed, LOL I probably should optimize some but, I like it producing about 24 FPS, but would be nice I suppose if I could adjust the performance lower so it uses less cpu.  Yours looks nice though =)<br />
<br />
Just was going for something softer on the eyes =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tooblai</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th December 2006, 15:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Change the output of the color map to 50/50. That should do it. <br />
If it doesn't then I suggest you to wait for jheriko to reply :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because the colors right now are coming from additive blending of faint superscopes doesn't mean that you can't replicate the functionality in a better way, i.e. one which allows you more control over the effect of the preset.<br />
<br />
It may not be important to you, but such techniques as using additive blended superscopes with a fadeout are NOT independent of framerate. This means that the preset will look different at different framerates (you obviously know this since you recommend 24fps). However it is not necessarily trivial to create an identical effect at a different framerate, however it gives you much more control if you can.<br />
<br />
I would explain the exact code required if you are interested, but I think it has been covered a few times before in the forums... that and it is trivial to derive.<br />
<br />
In the case of cloning an additive blend and fadeout effect it is possible though, although at low framerates or with highly fluctuating framerates you may get a sort of &quot;jitter&quot; effect (I have never been able to work out where it comes from exactly, I think it is something to do with the resolution of the timer or rounding errors though) the payoff is that it will look almost identical on any machine at any resolution with any framerate.<br />
<br />
Aspect ratio correction is good too... can't see from the picture if you have done that or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just 15 minutes until I can leave this god forsaken he...  I mean work.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Interesting preset... its quite basic though. I think maybe you should download some more avs presets, others have made similar smooth colour changing effects in presets, you just probably need to look around a bit.</div></div><hr />
