      Could I have your attention, please.<br />
      <br />
      We've decided that we want to feature two packs each week.<br />
      <br />
      The packs can be new, old, doesn't matter.<br />
      <br />
      We would like you to run a poll, and the top two will be featured each week.<br />
      <br />
      Nominations should run from Thursday-Sunday, with the poll on Monday and Tuesday. That way i will have the candidates by Wednesday.<br />
      <br />
      So do start a new thread for your nominations now for next weeks Featured Plug-ins.<br />
      <br />
      Keep it nice and clean, nominations only. Explanations are not needed. Don't let things get out of hand, because than we won't be able to continue user participation. And do NOT pimp your own packs, ok ?<br />
      <br />
      I reserve the right to modify or veto the choice, but I will NOT do that unless a new pack comes up that's worth featuring (in that case, I won't feature the one of the two with less votes), or if one of the packs that wins is really awful. Choose wisely in any case.</p>
