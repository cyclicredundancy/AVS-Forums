      <p class="post-content">Here's da review of the new things from the first pack you posted (I didn't d/l the 2nd one) :<br />
      <br />
      Title : Nice preset... I noticed the what seems to be 2 layers of Starfield, going opposite directions...<br />
      About the Dynamic Shift... lots of gibberish in it... You only need x,y, and the custom variable d, as it seems...<br />
      <br />
      Ever Changeable : Hmm, a new flavor... It's quite dynamic (Though not exactly) but it is kinda good...<br />
      You might want to make the variables change onBeat...<br />
      For the SSC, I think using rand(256)/255 for the random color variable will be better... that way you got the whole 16 bit of color =)<br />
      <br />
      Love is in Space : A dark preset... not much seems to be going on... Not exactly something that I'd look on for long time...<br />
      Delete the first DM. DM only affects things ABOVE it in the list.<br />
      <br />
      Love is in Space Remix : Static preset... Useless DM present... Boring :(<br />
      <br />
      Love is in Space Remix Again : I noticed the difference, but not much cosmetic addition. Otherwise, see the review for Love in Space Remix...<br />
      <br />
      Stuck Watching : Not exactly my taste... Not exactly special either... I prefer watching this using the OnBeat part of Blitter Feedback on, all the way to zooming in.<br />
      <br />
      Swing : Dynamic rotation... The ring in the foreground is kinda out of place... I'd say change the foreground to something better...<br />
      <br />
      Yellow Place 4 Me : Weird :weird: I'm kinda stumped on guessing what your objective of the preset is...<br />
      Nice dynamics, Another somewhat misplaced render... Foreground (The render/simple) is a bit... out of place...<br />
      <br />
      There Goes Pluto : Another weird preset... I can somewhat see the objective...<br />
      What's with the empty Channel Shift?<br />
      In the DM, you used the variable r (in this case, custom variable), but it is not even used...<br />
      <br />
      There Goes the World : Similiar to There Goes Pluto. Ouch.<br />
      I like the unwanted effect at the beginning though... half inverted and half uninverted... Here's a good way on making the effect :<br />
      <br />
      Items :<br />
      Buffer Safe, set to any buffer.<br />
      Invert.<br />
      DM<br />
      <br />
      For the DM, set to the same buffer as Buffer Safe<br />
      Set to No movement, just blend.<br />
      And now, the confusing coding part :<br />
      <br />
      Per Pixel :<br />
      alpha=if(Below(y,0+getosc(0,0.1,0)*2),1,0)<br />
      <br />
      Feel free to experiment with it, and replace the Invert with Unique Tone for a monotonic area, instead of inverted area.<br />
      <br />
      _-_-_-_-_<br />
      <br />
      EDIT : I believe this is the perfect time to use and learn OnBeat Dynamics. You got the somewhat dynamics, but once movements can go backward, forward, slow down, and accelerate, then you got true dynamics.</p>

        thanks:rolleyes:</b>
      </blockquote>Bnot? The only use of it that I know so far is for Solid SSCs....<br />
      <br />
      For AlphaBlending :<br />
      <br />
      It's usually used to hide bad edges and ugly spots (Usually from Infinity problems)... It uses the preset variables and custom ones...<br />
      I've found different uses from it though, such as OnBeat Invert, Inverter Lens, and Trans-that-only-happen-in-some-places.<br />
      <br />
      You can use If commands for alphablending...<br />
      <br />
      You can use series of BufferSave-ClearScreen-DM for effects with ugly edges/bad spots - Use alpha command in the same DM as the 3d one (Infinity problems usually occur in 3d presets), and check on blend.<br />
      If it's in the same place as an effect DM, the preset variables are altered like the actual effect.<br />
      <br />
      For pure Alphablend DM, check the "No movement (Just Blend)" Checkbox.<br />
      <br />
      To see Alpha Blending in full action, try one of UnConeD's 3d Presets, and check off the blend in the main 3D DM. BIG difference, eh?<br />
      <br />
      For alpha blending, the scale is 0-1 - 0 Being no darkening, 1 being full darkening.<br />
      <br />
      ---<br />
      To make OnBeat Invert (Out of memory, might be something wrong herer and there) :<br />
      <br />
      Place a Buffer Safe, Invert, and a DM.<br />
      Use the same buffer for DM.<br />
      <br />
      Frame : variable=if(above(variable,1),0,1)<br />
      Beat : variable=variable+1<br />
      Pixel : Alpha=if(equal(variable,0),1,0)<br />
      <br />
      Check the "No movement" Box.<br />
      ---<br />
      To make the Inverter lens, it's simple : Just use If, Bor, Below, and Above commands (and Rand to make a dynamic one).<br />
      The Inverter lens can also be used for an actual lens...<br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      YaPoNDeeZzZzz.., don't triple post... Just edit your post if no one had replied =)<br />
      <br />
      --<br />
      <br />
      Oh yeah, and OnBeat Dynamics :<br />
      <br />
      For X Axis Movement :<br />
      <br />
      Frame : variable=variable+variable1<br />
      Beat : Variable1=rand(251)/1000-rand(251)/1000<br />
      Pixel : x=x+variable<br />
      <br />
      Check Rectangular Coordinates on.<br />
      <br />
      Feel Free to change /1000 as *0.001<br />
      <br />
      When using this effect, make sure the item to be moved around is inside an effect list.<br />
      If you're going to use the DM to make a trail (I can't exactly find the right word), Replace the pixel box with x=x+variable1 - Therefore, you can delete the whole frame box.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>much better</strong><br />
      You're learning well! Good job on the DMs. I'd say you've improved a lot in comparison to your previous packs :)<br />
      <br />
      There's still room for improvement, but I'm sure your next pack will be better than this one!<br />
      <br />
      Think of it this way: Each suggestion or critical comment is what makes it so you can expand your AVS_skilz :D (okay okay, what I meant was becoming more proficient in AVS). So criticism is an essential part of learning. Keep up the good work! :up:<br />
      <br />
      Just thought I'd put in a positive note.<br />
      <br />
      (btw: I still can't figure out how you're learning so quickly, YaPoNDeeZzZzz). So how is it that you're learning AVS so quickly!?! :). You must spend a *lot* of time in AVS. How much time do you spend in AVS each day?)<br />

      sup ull....im back again....lol....this is my new presets..it contains 3 onBeat presets...ive taken nic 01's advice and tried to implement some onBeat things into my presets... Plz check em out and give me a holla bout them.....<br />
      Thanks......<br />

      how do i learn so much and how much time do i spend on AVS?<br />
      im 15 yrs old and in high school...i have an F in my spanish class..MAN:mad: ...and my uncle said i can only go on the computer on the weekends...(but i sneek on sometimes lol :p) so when Saturday and Sunday comes up i hog this computer for 48 hours (well almost ;) i have to stop to Eat..if only i didnt need to eat..Think of the posibilitys..) and i try to cram everything in my head..<br />

      <p class="post-content">You're 15?!?! I'm only almost 13...<br />
      <br />
      Ok, review for the presets :<br />
      <br />
      Living in an Eggshell : Whoa! You need quite more learning to do... I don't think you can use w and h as a custom variable : They stand for width and height of the AVS window in pixels...<br />
      <br />
      I can see that you've tried to alphablend, but the alphablend, in this preset, is quite useless : There's nothing to blend.<br />
      <br />
      The buffer save saved nothing at all...<br />
      <br />
      And the DMs are useless :eek: I deleted them, and the SSC only get 2x brighter... I believe it's because unnecesary blending of 2nd DM.<br />
      <br />
      Moving Lines : Looking good...<br />
      <br />
      The DM inside the 2nd effect list is totally useless... Fadeout fits in better there.<br />
      <br />
      The movement is kinda stiff... Adding a x and y axis DM will help.<br />
      <br />
      OnBeat Arrows : Eh, I saw nothing...<br />
      <br />
      After a little tinkering,however, I see what the preset is supposed to be like.<br />
      <br />
      Add a set render mode at the top of the effect list (In the effect list, tho), set it to additive, set line width to 3.<br />
      <br />
      The DMs : You don't need the o+ whatever...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      -_-_-_-_-_-_<br />
      <br />
      And so, the bottom line... You're getting nearer, but still require quite a learning. Learning OnBeat stuffs is prolly quite a milestone... And it isn't easy to learn for beginners.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>13 ? u got to be lying...lol</strong><br />
      thanks for the advice.....in moving lines the second dm in the second effect lists is to make all the ss kinda blend together..is there a easier way to do that?<br />
      <br />
      as for the alpha blending: i have no idea wht i was doing.....i still dont noe how its formula goes....lol:p living in an eggshell is my worst preset ive made so far..cant beleive i let u guys see it...lol..<br />
      <br />
      however ur advice on Onbeat arrows were great..i had the same problem i wanted to make it brighter...i tried Brightness but it made it worser....so thanks for the tip now i no wht set render mode does...so why "3" for the line width?<br />
      <br />
      aite imma go try to learn some mo'<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>suggestion for onbeat arrows</strong><br />
      Here's a suggestion (see the zip file). Here's what I did &amp; why. It was a little dark, so I added a brightness trans. I changed the DM a little bit so it would be more smooth (in this case, I used a tan). I also moved one of the DMs to outside the effect list.<br />
      <br />
      See what you think &amp; if you like it, just tinker with stuff like that.<br />
      <br />
      P.S. I added the tan to per frame because it will smooth the movement inbetween the onbeat movements. Adding a sin, cos, or tan to on beat won't do much to smooth things out.<br />
      <br />
      Yes, I know that I'm a member after I make this post.<br />

      <p class="post-content">For moving lines, you can use either Fadeout or Blur.<br />
      Blur offers more blending at cost of FPS.<br />
      <br />
      For OnBeat Arrows, the line width is to create more area of bright stuff.<br />
      The optimal size (I think) is (w+h)/200 rounded to the nearest whole number.<br />
      <br />
      For alpha Blending :<br />
      <br />
      Practice it!<br />
      Experiment it!<br />
      <br />
      To experiment :<br />
      <br />
      Add a Clear Screen-Set to white.<br />
      At a DM. This will be your Alpha Blending stuff.<br />
      <br />
      In the DM, blend away!<br />
      <br />
      Some formulas yo get you started :<br />
      <br />
      alpha=d;<br />
      alpha=-d+1;<br />
      alpha=x;<br />
      alpha=-x;<br />
      alpha=y;<br />
      alpha=-y;<br />
      <br />
      For dynamics, use regular movements, or use the getosc command.<br />

      It's kinda monoted (If you know what I mean), and the dynamicity (Is there such word?) of the preset is not exactly easy to spot... The dynamics covered the area of a mere... about (4-pi)/4 of the place...<br />
      <br />
      Just remembered one very, very important pointer :<br />
      <br />
      To speed up your learning, learn from other artists' presets!<br />
      That way, you'll see how things work and a lot of other things...<br />
      <br />
      Just to get you started, there's 2 Presets attached in a zip.<br />
      Those presets are going to be in my next pack...<br />
      Those presets are somewhat the better from the pack, so enjoy.<br />
      Oh, and do me a favor : Really learn from it :) :) :)</p>

      Nic01: If you're a writer, you're given the right to make up your own words for fun (especially in poetry)-just so long as it's apparent what they mean. So even if it wasn't a word before, you could have made it a word in your post :)<br />
      <br />
      YaPoNDeeZzZzz: I got your post on my laptop, and I wanted to be able to post it-but two things kept me from it. 1st: I've been really busy lately, 2.) my big computer (the one with the preset modification on it) was down for mandatory maintenance all last night--so that's why I didn't make a post including the .zip file I forgot to attach, but everything's back and running now. The zip file is attached<br />

      <p class="post-content">ohhh b4 i go<br />
      <br />
      i'm still trying to learn the whole onBeat movement thing....so i made this preset......<br />
      <br />
      im looking for help with it though..<br />
      <br />
      im trying to make the background shift right - then left- on every beat....<br />
      <br />
      example:<br />
      first beat=background shift left<br />
      second beat= background shifts right<br />
      <br />
      is there an easier way to get this effect ? rather then the way i am doing it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Since I know this IS an experiment preset to make OnBeat direction change, I'll just give a pointer about the preset itself, and then it's all about DM.<br />
      <br />
      I can't exactly see the change of direction very well...<br />
      <br />
      The DM : You used If command? It doesn't properly change onBeat at all...<br />
      <br />
      So, here's how to do it.<br />
      <br />
      Init : m=1;<br />
      frame : t=t+0.1*m<br />
      Beat : m=-m<br />
      Pixel : x=x+t<br />
      <br />
      Simple as that.<br />
      <br />
      For random speed onBeat, however :<br />
      <br />
      Init : m=1;<br />
      frame : t=t+t1*m<br />
      Beat : m=-m; t1=rand(101)/1000<br />
      Pixel : x=x+t<br />
      <br />
      Simple as that =)</p>
