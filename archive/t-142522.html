			<strong>ColorMap v1.2</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Changes:<br />
 v1.2<br />
 - Added Flip/Clear buttons<br />
 - Added (R+G+B)/3 key, renamed Brightness to (R+G+B)/2<br />
 - On-beat cycling is (temporarily) disabled while editing maps<br />
 - When adding a new color, the default color is auto-set to the color at that<br />
   position in the map.<br />
 - Double-clicking an empty spot will add a new color at that point. Double-clicking an existing color will edit that color.<br />
 - Expanded the help-message a bit.<br />
 - Added visible version info to the dialog<br />
<br />
Please try it out and report crashes here. Once it's stable everywhere I'll release it 'officially' and add it to the APE list.

		no problems so far, but i think pressing the clear button should also clear the name of loaded colormaps.

		Heh, this was already being done, but the label wasn't being updated (it would clear if you switched to another map, and back again). Fixed now, thanks for reporting.<br />
<br />
I'll wait until tomorrow and release it good. So <b>DON'T DISTRIBUTE THIS VERSION YET</b>.

		Kind of sucks that you had to leave in the old incorrect brightness key in, since it's cluttering and pretty much useless...but I guess you had to leave in support for presets that still used that key...but nonetheless, yay for new versions (didn't you say you were gonna stop updating things? ;))

		Yup the old one is left in for compatibility reasons, which is also the reason why the order is a bit weird... right now the order in the drop-down is the same as the value used in the config (an integer).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway considering no other feedback was posted, here's final Color Map 1.2. Only the issue reported by yathosho was fixed.

		Hey, cool! Just an idea, ucd could you add a map rotation (the map itself) like some graphic progs offer? Moving the starting pointof themap shouldnt be too hard, is it?

		I think I have this one nailed down, though over here it only happens on a blank preset with 10-15 colormaps.<br />
<br />
The bug is a synchronisation problem... in certain cases when you remove a component, the object gets destroyed before the configuration dialog has finished its cleanup and gotten its WM_DESTROY message.<br />
As of v1.2.1, map cycling is disabled during editing, and as the dialog is closed, this is turned back on again. So in certain cases, the object was already destroyed at this point, causing an access violation.<br />
<br />
Try with this version (not final). It doesn't crash

		Since it's up again, i might tell you about what i have been experiencing.<br />
<br />
Well it seems that presets slow down after a while of shuffling trough a &quot;couple&quot; , now i don't know for certain is this the fault of the colormap v.1.21 i have been using, but all the presets that exprienced the slow downs were using colormaps. Im just asking has anyone else noticed something like this? Or is my own comp just buggin the hell out of me :rolleyes:

		One thing that annoys me:<br />
<br />
If the colormap is beeing edited, rotation will stop. Nicey nice, but if i close the Editor with the colormap selcted, it still is sticky.<br />
<br />
UCD, please make the visible state of the AvsEditor a &quot;stop rotation&quot; criteria too. A simple checkbox would also do.<br />
<br />
Another thing: i cannot turn the effect off completely, hence another &quot;Enable Effect&quot; checkbox would be nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your 20 minutes of work :D i'd really appreciate this.

		I'm not a fan of 'enable effect' checkboxes though. Why waste space on it?<br />
<br />
Just make a disabled effect list and drag all your unused stuff in there if you want to keep it.<br />
<br />
As far as the 'not unstickying when avs editor closes', that would mean AVS is simply hiding the window rather than closing it. Currently the unstickying is not a check that is performed constantly, but simply a toggle that is performed when the dialog is opened/closed.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can fix it though.
