      if anyone did care this version also works in excel 2000 with a tiny code change (it was updating every .5 seconds before.. i had to change it to every 1). next time i get stuck at work with nothing to do for ages expect to see a bresenham line drawing version... right now it uses my own r33t++ super hax :)</p>

      my coding skills are being appreciated and am currently writing an enormous vba macro, its actually pretty dull but at least its code :)<br />
      <br />
      nice work tomy.. great minds think alike.. blah blah<br />
      <br />
      the difference is that i took the most difficult route to making it, using cells as a video array... not exactly speedy or efficient.</p>
