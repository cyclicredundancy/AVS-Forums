<div class="posttext">nullsoft released waste (http://www.deviantart.com/news/10165/)  and i was wondering who to benefit from it. i think we could use it instead of irc (and open a channel there) and also as somekind of avs p2p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looks alright, but mIRC is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well see what happens.. see what features come about.. <br />
Because it is open source/binary, it will probably explode into a very popular platform. Plus, it is more adaptable to AVSers because of the file sharing/browsing aspect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Firewall issues become moot as messages are routed to the appropriate party through other hosts.You can imagine that this will be music to alot of peoples ears.<br />
<br />
[edit] im all for setting up an AVSers channel/group/whatever</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I suggest you guys use mIRC-friendly and easy and customizable-and give Undernet a shot...That network is big,user friendly and #avs is free :D We can register it and make that channel the primary avs chat channel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh god...more fragmentation<br />
<br />
I think that we should try to LIMIT the sites we use.  So much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">...in case you haven't noticed, there is that #FINNISH-FLASH that BOTH of you frequent already...besides that i heartily agree with m2k, the last thing we need is another avs site/chan floating around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">zamuz</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th May 2003, 22:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that 'avs p2p' idea sounds really cool, and i think that it's up to each one of us which site to use. WASTE would be kinda different from those sites cause it's real-time... that's what i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th May 2003, 22:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah but isnt finnish flash going to brake up ? And the chan will be purged i guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st May 2003, 01:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">FYI WASTE is no more. See www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/ for more info and that is as much as I know.<br />
<br />
I was going to lock the thread but that debate on p2p, protocols of it all can continue<br />
<br />
(Oh and no posting linkls to the software please as they will ahve to be removed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st May 2003, 01:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yegads.. how did it get onto the news so quike if it was unofficial.<br />
I though you would have had to release some promo shit to get that sort of responce.<br />
<br />
So when is the real WASTE arriving?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, i think #finnish-flash is good enough, #avs would be pointless seeing as we allready have an AVS dedicated channel. BTW, most of the people at finnish-flash have nothing to do with finnish flash. And plus, if finnsh-flash does die, that dont meant hte channel has to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Even though finnish flash the team might not release anything ever again (we have 3 members &quot;active&quot;) The channel will remain im pretty sure about that. So don't think that the death of the team will be the death of the channel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">According to the Nullsoft statement, i guess it is not so clever, posting here that you illegaly use waste, is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">DanBUK</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd July 2003, 13:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Was it not released under GPL? (Cannot be revoked)<br />
<br />
Also, put a search in google for <br />
Nullsoft Waste Mirror<br />
And I'm sure you will get more than 10 results.<br />
<br />
Would it not be fair to say it was AOLs action that cause it to be removed?<br />
<br />
Just my 15pence worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't ment to tell you not to use it, just thought it would'nt be the finest idea to tell everyone, especially within Nullsofts own Forum.<br />
<br />
Dunno wheter they care or not...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well if you search for &quot;ILLEGAL FLAMING HAMSTER PORN&quot; you're sure to get at least 10 results too.  Rule number one for debates: NEVER use Google to back up your arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">DanBUK</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd July 2003, 04:52</div></div>

<div class="posttext">So Dogpile is better to use then... :blah:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the question is if AOL can simply undo the license under which WASTE was released. they're in a similiar sitatuation as SCO right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The GPL cannot be revoked, but only if the distributer had the right to release it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th July 2003, 13:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">As far as i know, this prog found it's way onto the site by mistake, which for my understanding doesn't include any kind of license for those who redistributed it.<br />
<br />
But i think this will be released sooner or later anyway.</div></div><hr />
