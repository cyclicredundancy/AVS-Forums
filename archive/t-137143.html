      nullsoft released <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/news/10165/" target="_blank">waste</a> and i was wondering who to benefit from it. i think we could use it instead of irc (and open a channel there) and also as somekind of avs p2p.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well see what happens.. see what features come about..<br />
      Because it is open source/binary, it will probably explode into a very popular platform. Plus, it is more adaptable to AVSers because of the file sharing/browsing aspect.<br />
      <br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">I suggest you guys use mIRC-friendly and easy and customizable-and give Undernet a shot...That network is big,user friendly and #avs is free :D We can register it and make that channel the primary avs chat channel.</p>

      I think that we should try to LIMIT the sites we use. So much easier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">...in case you haven't noticed, there is that <b>#FINNISH-FLASH</b> that BOTH of you frequent already...besides that i heartily agree with m2k, the last thing we need is another avs site/chan floating around.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that 'avs p2p' idea sounds really cool, and i think that it's up to each one of us which site to use. WASTE would be kinda different from those sites cause it's real-time... that's what i think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">FYI WASTE is no more. See <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/" target="_blank">www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/</a> for more info and that is as much as I know.<br />
      <br />
      I was going to lock the thread but that debate on p2p, protocols of it all can continue<br />
      <br />
      (Oh and no posting linkls to the software please as they will ahve to be removed)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yegads.. how did it get onto the news so quike if it was unofficial.<br />
      I though you would have had to release some promo shit to get that sort of responce.<br />
      <br />
      So when is the <b>real</b> WASTE arriving?<br />
      <br />
      Meanwhile, i think #finnish-flash is good enough, #avs would be pointless seeing as we allready have an AVS dedicated channel. BTW, most of the people at finnish-flash have nothing to do with finnish flash. And plus, if finnsh-flash does die, that dont meant hte channel has to.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Even though finnish flash the team might not release anything ever again (we have 3 members "active") The channel will remain im pretty sure about that. So don't think that the death of the team will be the death of the channel.</p>

      Also, put a search in google for<br />
      Nullsoft Waste Mirror<br />
      And I'm sure you will get more than 10 results.<br />
      <br />
      Would it not be fair to say it was AOLs action that cause it to be removed?<br />

      <p class="post-content">As far as i know, this prog found it's way onto the site by mistake, which for my understanding doesn't include any kind of license for those who redistributed it.<br />
