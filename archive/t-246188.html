			<strong>Emanations - First Pack</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I decided to go ahead and release my first pack of avs presets (16). Any feedback from you guys will help me improve the next pack. Perhaps there are some winners in here, perhaps not. A few of them i really like, probably because i made them. :-)<br />
<br />
Enjoy!!<br />
<br />
//edit: Oh yeah ... also feel free to remix any of these. :-)

		Thanks for the good words. At least they are not all bad. :-)<br />
<br />
I just discovered avs a few weeks ago, so it will take me some time to learn the &quot;techy&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
//edit: Oh, and i'll try to include a &quot;chrome&quot; preset in my next pack, just for you. :-)

		Sorry if i'm being too impatient, but after posting my beginner pack a week ago, i've been rather disappointed at the response. I was expecting at least a clue as to which of these presets were good, bad, or just ok.

While searching THIS forum, i've seen beginner packs reviewed and critiqed, each and every preset was commented on. I was hoping for something like that, or at least some idea about my first attempt at avs, more than just &quot;nice pack&quot; for example. I just want a clue to help me improve.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

		Well it's nice that you've (at least partially) learned how to use the superscope and there are some of the presets that a really nice. My personal favs in this one is orchid, pretty, rotoswirl and wavy flower. The rest of the presets seem to empty to me, because there is no effect that is in focus, and nothing that fills the background. My favorite preset in the pack is orchid, because it fills up the screen nicely, and has a nice movement, although it gets somewhat repetitive.<br />
<br />
Although the oscilliscope theme that many of the presets has is good for music visualization, I think that it's used for too many presets here, and that you should try to find a way to present it in a way that will seem more interresting. Also you should probably check your presets for unneeded parts, for instance there were sevral effectlists and probably some water that were unneeded (and dragged down the framerate slightly).

		Many thanks for your comments and suggestions. I'm sure they will help me to do better on my next pack. I'm trying different things now, but music response will always be a must.<br />
<br />
I've also started learning Texer II, i like this APE, so my next pack will have some Texer II presets.

		actually these presets look pretty typical for a beginner pack. some of the superscope work is quite decent but try to<br />
find other bg filling methods than water.

		Overall some promising ideas, but the execution is not that good [yet]. I know this is the standard 1st pack statement... Anyway the main point in your pack is [like so often in the beginning] the coloring and background. Practise, it's not that you lack artistic sense, practise, practise! Oh, and [if you haven't already] start reading Pak-9's programming guide, it's the ultimate key to better AVSing! :up:<br />
<br />
<b>Dancing notes</b><br />
the colors are a bit to flat, and with such simple renders a background is needed. just try a simple gradient, they do wonders. [and the notes' necks are on the wrong side, they need to be right when pointing upwards]<br />
<b>Starfish</b><br />
I like this one, but still the background is missing. movements are nice and colors are too most of the time, though they'd better be less random.<br />
<b>Singing head</b><br />
waaaahahaaahhaaa, this cannot be! ok funny indeed but too little action!<br />
his mouth should move more often than twice a second.<br />
<b>Scissors</b><br />
standard but ok. disabling the water effect removes the flickkering in the background and speeds this thing up. you could use a blur or better a convo filter to achieve the same effect.<br />
<b>Rotoswirl</b><br />
I like it. but not mindblowing, standard rather<br />
<b>Raindrops</b><br />
there are better presets which are good for their 'chill-factor'<br />
<b>Pretty</b><br />
I find this one to be really interesting if only there would be a background and better coloring<br />
<b>Pinwheel</b><br />
Faaaar too simple to go w/o a background...<br />
<b>Oscillodance 1&amp;2</b><br />
The colors are good on this one imo. but they are so nicely created and spoiled at the same time by the nowadays boring water effect. the mix doesn't bring anything new to the screen...<br />
<b>Orchid</b><br />
would be really great with a background and more exciting coloring<br />
<b>Next to nothing</b><br />
well this one is nice, but the regular AVS-watcher sees at once, that this is only a &quot;slight fuzzily&quot; + DDM standard movement remix of Oscillodance.<br />
<b>Mothership</b><br />
really good movements and ships imo. but the background makes it look like a pile of... well, I'll spare you that.<br />
<b>Equalizer plus</b><br />
looks good now with the yellow membranes [right word?] I liked the original [yes, I mean v1!]  aproach to the movement of the boxes better though.<br />
<b>Wavy flower</b><br />
Hehey, looks like a distinct color scheme to me. and decent movements. but the desaturated feedback as a background..., well, better than nothing but still not that pleasing to the eyes<br />
<br />
I hope you now know what to do.<br />

		Many thanks for reviewing my first pack. This will be a great help to me. I still have a lot to learn, especially about backgrounds.

Thanks for the tip about Pak-9's programming guide. I had previously found the link to this guide in this thread titled &quot;A list of AVS Tutorials&quot; on the AVS Forum<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=209060</a><br />
<br />
And at this link ...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/download/11200891/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/download/11200891/</a><br />
<br />
I downloaded AVS_Programming_Guide.zip. In this zip was a folder with 18 exercises and a WordPad document titled &quot;AVS Programming Guide&quot; (303 kb). But when i try to open this document, i get this message ...<br />
<br />
&quot;WordPad has caused an error in MSWRD832.CNV. WordPad will now close.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just downloaded it again, with the same result. Any idea why i can't open this document? The exercises are great, but i'm sure there is much more good stuff in the WordPad document.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance

		Wordpad cannot show the document correctly, because it doesn't support all of the graphics of Word documents. If you don't have Word you should download a free office pack (like openoffice, k-office or abiword).<br />
The exercises should be done while reading the document, which does contain much more good stuff.

		Thanks for the tip. I don't have Word, so i downloaded AbiWord. Now i have the full benefit of the Pak-9 programming guide. A quick glance revealed lots of great study material.  :-)
