<div class="posttext">Since I like to teach instead of tell, I am going to explain it.  Create a new Superscope, go to load example and click on &quot;Alternating Diagonal Slope&quot;. Now, lets change the numbers around.  First of all erase the On Beat box, this will make the scope not bounce back and forth.  In the per point box there is a X and a Y.  These are the coordinates.  x=2*(i-0.5-v*sc)*t; y=2*(i-0.5+v*sc); change it so it reads, x=.5*(i-1-v*sc)*t; y=.5*(i-1+v*sc); Now its starts at the midpoint and goes half the distance, so make some more scopes and change some numbers.  Maybe Unconed can give us an example using one scope, but right now I have a headache so I am not going to figure it out yet.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here is one thats crappy, I wouldn't even call it an osciloscope star.   But it's a place to start for beginners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">greatWho</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th February 2002, 20:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I developed your suggestion further... view the result... its made with only one SS... the trick is that:<br />
per Frame: dx=dx*(-1)<br />
per Point: di=di*(-1);<br />
sc=0.9*sin(i*3.14159); <br />
x=di*dx*.6*(i-1-v*sc)*t*si; <br />
y=di*.5*(i-1+v*sc)*t*si; <br />
<br />
<br />
dx=dx*(-1) will mirror the scope in x <br />
di=di*(-1) will mirror the scope to the other 2 sides<br />
<br />
it's not really a OscilloscopeStar, but it does look good.. ;-)<br />
<br />
maybe UnConeD will have a better solution</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice scope I never seen anything like it.  I get your idea for the mirroring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">GreatWho- Check this bad boy out, just do your mirroring and you'll have yourself a star.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">what do you think about the mirroring of your second Scope?<br />
i also made a onBeat-Speedchange</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My friend you are a genious.  I think you should definately post this, somewhere.  Everyone should experience force of superscopes at it's greatest.  Cudos to you my friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a good superscope replacement for the oscilloscope star. Change the vars in Init to change the star's attributes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Obviously there has been a mistake while the sorting out of AVS forums to the selected sub folders, a mistake as been made.<br />
<br />
Understandable as there is a lot of work going on.<br />
<br />
Now MD community I will again risk my very life by reporting this - even though it helps the whole of the winamp community.<br />
<br />
The things I do for MD (and actually Winamp). I do not know how long I can keep this up.<br />
<br />
I await the abusive emails...................no doubt not long!<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Rovastar all I can say is that I hope you get everything sorted out smoothly without any major headaches or problems. You do not deserve it. SM</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ha Ha, Unconed you did it again, that is a Os. star alright, they look identical.<br />

<div class="posttext">UnConeD<br />
that's a great job you have made. how do you go on it, to find any forms to build in SS, as seen in oscss.avs ? can you give any t√Æps? so I do not have to disturb you with any stupid question ;-)<br />
<br />
Rovastar<br />
mistakes are good to learn any new ideas, to make them better and easyer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2002, 21:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:) No problem with mistakes. Only a problem with mistakes that are not corrected. <br />
<br />
So when I got the power moved it myself. It is all good. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Um well first I made one arm of the osc star, which is just a curve that ranges from (0,r) to (1,r) (polar coords) and has variation in r depending on the sound (the first preset here modified y in function of sound, instead of r).<br />
Then, to create multiple arms, I just increase the 'r' with 2*pi/arms radians every time one arm is finished. I also changed the color to black for each ending-point to make sure the arms are not connected.<br />
Just analyse what each effect does, express it as mathematical formulas and code it in AVS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">and now... there's the reason, i wanted to have a  osciloscope Star in SS...to change its color how and when i want...here is one &quot;how&quot; on the timeing i will work on<br />
<br />
the second i made is a dynamic movement... it's an experience, i think it looks like a watch<br />
<br />
look</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">on unconed superscope, try adding: <br />
perframe: t1=t1-.05;<br />
perpoint: size=tan(t1);<br />
<br />
zooming oscillscope :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">greatWho</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th February 2002, 22:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">thanx for this tip, but try this one:<br />
;t1=t1-9*getspec(0.9,0.4,0);<br />
<br />
would also be nice :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">BlurPak2k1</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st March 2002, 01:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">theres an awful lote of math in that superscope though, kinda slow :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
nice movement GW :D</div></div><hr />
