<br />
Also, I think you've stolen some code. Really don't do that. It make you a fucking arsehole.<br />
<br />
Finally, why so many onbeatclears?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to answer your question, start with learning what does what before you start bithcing others off.<br />
Further it's hard to for me rate your preset, since I don't know which parts you ripped and what it yours. But let's stay on the safe side and for a few seconds assume the code's yours...<br />
<br />
The pattern looks okay, but everytime I try to take a closer look I hurt my eyes from the strobing onbeatclears and way-too-fast bass spin. Better code a new bass spin that's somewhat slower. Shoudln't be too difficult since you can code that other scope.<br />
(I really prefer the second Color map off though by the way)<br />
Furthermore, the top and bottom really need some filling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm finding it a bit strange that you get paid for making a visualization, since there are dozens of excellent avs packs out there (http://browse.deviantart.com/visualization/avspresets/) , and all absolutely for free. (Why do we professional AVSers never get paid? :()<br />
<br />
About the preset: Well... the background's okay, but the scope doesn't fit the rest. Yeah, and the Onbeat Clear really IS annoying. Overall not mind blowing at all, because it looks the same as 1000 other presets, but surprisingly very good for a first preset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 05:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The overall look of the preset is okay. It could use some improvement, but for a first try it's not bad looking.<br />
<br />
However, considering that this is your first preset, I find it quite hard to believe that the SSC code is entirely yours. In the event that it is, I agree with WotL: you should have coded a better and slower bass spin.<br />
<br />
In concern to the effects, the grain is quite useless. Also, why use six OnBeat Clears?<br />
<br />
All in all, the preset is okay. If the coding is all yours, and if you improve some of the coding and work on improving the style a bit, I should look forward to seeing more of your work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The first effect list is a straight copy from &quot;degnic - spirit realm (plasmoid rmx)&quot; so the original coding is by Sander Kupers (whom's preset the remix is from).<br />
So yeah, you copying from other people and getting paid for it... it's just not cool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's what u think..But for me..Keep Up da good job..Try to copy more..while copying,try to understand the effects of the codes when you put it..At the end..you can be like a pro and will replace Tuggummi place..Yeah MAJOR DUDE!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, that's what you think. But for me (and i guess everybody else) no one will ever replace Tuggummi. He's one of the great AVS-artists around and has also influenced the scene a lot.<br />
<br />
Beside that, the remix posted above isn't a good job. It's the work of a noob. Sorry, but who else would add so many (annoying) on-beat clears?! And if he wasn't new to all the stuff he wouldn't have used someone elses code without even noticing it any further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">pjw29</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 18:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, thank you for all the comments, there is a few things i should explain, the coding isnt exactly mine as most of you have guessed, good on you, its probably illegal or something what i was doing, good for you to notice and say, secondly when i said i was being paid you have taken it far to literally, i got paid in pints of larger, does that make it as bad, the multiple on beat clears are a bit pointless as one would of done, but there had to be one as the guy that asked me to do it asked for that in it, he said (i quote) &quot;can i have a bright flash as close to on time with the music as you can?&quot;. finally i would like to appolagise for my english spelling and grammar, i suck at both, im a physics student not a dictionary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">oo, me again, i made another visualisation this afternoon after my girlfriend nagged me to make something creative for her (don't ask how that came up) i made this, its not very complex or anything, i was jus wondering if people liked it as those sorta things go, bare in mind i took a quick 2 minutes over it as my girlfriend wanted me for more important things.<br />
<br />
<br />
and before i forget, what sort of music is everyone listning to when they are trying my visualisations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 19:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i listen to loud &amp; beat intesive techno most of the time when viewing presets, and im assuming that's what the major part of presets are build for. Nowadays people do make presets that work very well with other types of music too, mainly because there's much more code involved which helps a lot of creating very cool analyzers, scenes, objects that all react to the music someway. You just can't make that kind of stuff with basic components.<br />
<br />
As for the preset, it looks like a generic first timer preset, we've seen them thousands of times, we've made them ourselves when we were starting, it just doesn't offer anything for anyone who's either watched or created presets for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">pjw29</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 19:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i understand exactly where u are coming from, im using rock music with avs and it seems to fitvery well, some of them are way to techno (not meant as an insult im sure you understand) but some are great, i guess if you like one music you just have to find a good preset to match it, as for my first timerness, its true i am a run of the mill new timer, i have no background in programming or anything, i just get very bored of having everyone elses presets and i now dream of the day i can jus create one to my exact preferences. ur all very tolerent of boring newcomers, im impressed, do u have any good programming tips that would be useful to me???</div></div><hr />

<br />
All i can really recommend is PAK-9's AVS Programming tutorial (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/), which many people have said to be a major help for them (also see this list of other tutorials (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060) that revolve around avs)<br />
You have to self-study a lot in AVS, there's really no one to teach you it personally, it's just too time consuming for both parties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">pjw29</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 19:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">what a coincidence, iv just downloaded and started reading the pak-9 guide, i saw it and thought that might help. i am easily confused when trying to learn new things, good job i already know lots about physics. Ill keep u posted on my presets as i learn more, thanx for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2005, 20:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You said you're a physics student? So i guess you have to cope a lot with mathematics. This'll help a lot when it comes to learn the basic coding stuff. At least for me it was very helpfull to know quite a bit about math.<br />
<br />
But you shouldn't think that tidy code alone brings you good presets! The second (actually the more important) part is design/style. And also keep in mind that you'll need a good portion of creativity to make new presets!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well i guesss its useful that i used to be a art, maths and physics student before i started to do physics seperatley at university. <br />
<br />
Im gonna go of on a huge tangent now, but before i came across AVS i used to like G-Force and have a waveshape i made for it, is there a simple way to copy and paste the coding? <br />
<br />
When i say im new to programming and codind i mean it, G-Force was all maths so i was ok, it would be great if someone offered me a helping hand!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Damn that heart preset sucks :igor:... I'd kill you for that if I was your girlfriend! (But fortunately I'm not :p) Tested with some beat rich electronic stuff and found to be 100% crappy.<br />
My advice: If you wanna do a love preset, avoid hectic movements and make something &quot;beautiful&quot;. (Women always love something flowerish ;))<br />
<br />
Hm... G-Force? Some sort of a vis studio, right? Don't know anything about it, maybe you could give us a link or something?<br />
<br />
Besides: Hey cool, I was a physics student myself! Just gave up after two semesters because there was too much math. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">for a love preset, just look at tuggummi's love one (cant remember the title, sorry dude :D) or my &quot;digital love&quot; from reminiscence. as for coding the beat detection...well...try &quot;orifice&quot; from me in mindscapes ;)<br />
<br />
you got paind &quot;in pints of larger&quot; ???? explain this please?<br />

hell if i would get ripped and the ripper got even paid for the stuff...omg...that would start a war.</div></div><hr />

I think you meant paid, and he meant a pint of lager(beer) as the vis was for a club.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Lager&quot; is a kind of beer, isn't it?<br />

<div class="posttext">*bangs head into keyboard* yeah me and my typos. ehh if it was only a beer, i would be angry too. especially if it was some good one, and a LARGE one...ohhh. and yes, lager is a kind of beer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yes i meant lager which is obviiously a beer, we have bitter stout and ale as other types of beer in england so we call them there proper names, and why would anyone not like beer!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
anyway, Tuggummi could you check out this superscope, im just experimenting with my maths stuff for superscopes, is this any good??? it is only a superscope i havnt added anything yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd September 2005, 21:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">A pretty basic scope, but if you can find a good use for it, why not? Eeh, it's kinda dumb to say &quot;this isn't any good&quot;, because even the most complicated superscope ain't flying nowhere if you can't find a good use for it. Sure there are extreme exceptions where the preset is just a single superscope (no need for anyone to point that out now), but most of the time you need to figure out good effects to go with your scopes.<br />
Code is a tool, it gives you control, you just have to find a way to use it to get what you want, and you have to have a pretty solid idea of what your goal is.<br />
<br />
And that's really the secret of succesful preset making.<br />
Have fun! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree there.  I've seen some really good presets(and  no I can't memorize the names of even presets I like) with sloppy looking code.  I couldn't make heads or tails of any of it, even after copying and pasting into Notepad.<br />
<br />
That said, tidy code is really good for when you mess up.  You're bound to mess up when things get complicated, and it's much easier to wade through a tidy piece of code to find what went wrong, than it is trying to locate the mistake in a long, disorganized, well, sloppy, piece of code:D  <br />
<br />
But then that's true of any language.</div></div><hr />
