<div class="posttext">Done on Atero's request.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
well i can take a hint.  this'll probably be my last &quot;posting&quot; ever, so please read - and please, don't delete this one too.<br />
<br />
that, my friends, is simply fucked up.  however i'm gonna assume the &quot;denial of service attack&quot; has to do with the way banning works, so that'd be a question for the admins.  now my question is this: do you REALLY want someone who's not going to let you object to the way he mods deciding whether you've got a voice or not?  honestly, gonzotek, who died and made you god???<br />
<br />
there, i'm done.  i've said my peace.  like i said before, you're probably never going to see me again on these forums - and i may quit avs alltogether as well.  i'm going to leave it up to you guys to get the da3bd tribute together.<br />
bye.<br />
<br />
--Atero<br />
<br />
p.s. gonzotek - if you so much as touch nic01's account because of this, i'll...i'll...shake my finger at your avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">OK, if you read this atero - it's not that you were trying to disagree with the mods - I've done that before.  It's the way that you tried to do it.  Flaming everyone is not the way to go about doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Gonzotek</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2003, 04:30</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you anubis.  That's absolutely the crux of it.<br />
<br />
Atero, get this: No one died and made me God.  I, however, was asked to do this by admin and other moderators and only accepted the role after thinking about it for some time.  Who asked you to flame people on Winamp's behalf?  You're still welcome back after your temp banning(done not by me, but, justly, by your regular AVS mod) and you're still welcome to discuss what you think this forum needs with me if you want.  I believe my email address if easy enough to discover. I'm not at all sure what quitting AVS does for you, but I guess if it makes you happy, go for it, man!<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. Regarding Nic01: Nothing will be done to his account, but there was ABSOLUTELY no reason to use another means of contacting me.  You had every opportunity to make a reasonable statement on this forum and you still have the opportunity to talk to me privately.  That you still haven't done so only shows the forum more clearly what you're really about.<br />

<div class="posttext">When I have a preset I'm proud of, ya'll will be the first to see it.  What more do you want, a few drops of my blood, sweat, and tears mailed to you in a wee glass vial to prove my dedication?  In the words of a better man than me, put up or shut up.  Either make positive suggestions about what I *should* be doing for you or put me on ignore and just follow the basic forum rules and you'll never notice I'm here.<br />
<br />
OK, Just found out (thanks Jones) I am technically Un-Ignorable due to my mod status.  My bad.  There still shouldn't be much reason for me to interact with most people, as a mod, unless I'm requested to or someone does something blatently against the rules.<br />

Just to make us feel better ? *tears* ... :D Now lets get serious.Anyone who wants to talk to atero send him an email.Or go to #finnish-flash on Quakenet for the best chat.And Atero DONT QUIT AVS BECAUSE OF A BAN FROM SOME FORUMS.Deviantart still exists...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Of course I'll do AVS.  But not just to make people feel better (although I'd be happy to hear it does), but also to understand it and to enjoy it myself.  I like coding, and I like tweaking things and it seems to me that AVS is great fun for someone who like's that.  Plus I can't think of a better way to be ready to answer n00b questions than having gone through the same thing they have.  If the stigmata of my being a mod ever wears off, I'd really like to have some friendly technical conversations with people here.  I've never been very good with math and I look at this as a chance to improve that skill.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Before AVS i had no skills or interest with math. Staring in wonder at the code of others such as UnConeD, jheriko, Zevensoft, El-vis and all the other advanced coder inspired me to learn trig and other useful aspects of math involved in avs, it made me realise that math isn't so hard once you can be bothered to read it properly and that coding helps towards making great presets. There really are that many threads that help on here. It'sjust a case of learning and practice, just like anything, never give up trying, Good luck on your AVS quest ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Gonzo: no offense, it's just that I haven't seen you post here much, and the whole point of getting more mods was to get some that would be AVSers themselves rather than another 'outsider' like Rovastar.<br />

Rovastar is still doing a great job, but personally I would only moderate something I care about. I can understand that as a Milkdropper, he won't hang around as often (perfectly normal).<br />

Normally your only duties aside from moderating will be to update the faq and wishlist stickies (though it's up to the regulars here now to track it really and send you the updates).</div></div><hr />

Gonzo: no offense, it's just that I haven't seen you post here much, and the whole point of getting more mods was to get some that would be AVSers themselves rather than another 'outsider' like Rovastar. Unfortunately, the moderating team just took on four additional mods (me, russ, will, and Nunzio) and weren't looking for more.Rovastar is still doing a great job, but personally I would only moderate something I care about. I can understand that as a Milkdropper, he won't hang around as often (perfectly normal).I care about AVS, this is my opportunity to learn it.  Haven't you ever had an interest that you never got around to indulging in?  I've been playing with AVS as a user for years, now I want to take it a step further.  I didn't know last week I'd be doing this, it's true, but that doesn't change how I feel about it now.Normally your only duties aside from moderating will be to update the faq and wishlist stickies (though it's up to the regulars here now to track it really and send you the updates).Sounds good to me.<br />

<div class="posttext">I think the FAQ is in great need of an update. Firstly, it still says the latest version is v2.5, there are many new threads and new coding techniques, things that just generally need putting in there. The last time it had an update was 8th October 2002, that was almost 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />

I have given up on the wishlist stickies as there is no update. (MD as well as AVS) I mean what is the point.<br />
<br />
Hey I care about AVS too. :);)<br />
<br />
lol at Raz have YOU yourself actually read the FAQ. You newbie. ;);)<br />
<br />
From the FAQ<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
Question #9: AVS keeps cycling the presets around. How can I stop this and make it show the same preset indefinitely? <br />
<br />
To turn this off, you have to open the configuration dialog first (see Question #2). Then, go to the 'Settings' menu at the top, click 'Presets/Hotkeys'. Now, turn off the checkbox marked 'Randomly switch presets'. <br />
Note that AVS will never cycle presets while the configuration dialog is open, even when this is turned on. Make sure that this is turned off anyway when creating presets, because you could easily lose an unsaved preset this way. &quot;<br />
<br />
Raz the latest version is still 2.5 within reason all other version 2.5.1 and the latest one have no useful features you may as well use 2.5 is what I mean.</div></div><hr />
