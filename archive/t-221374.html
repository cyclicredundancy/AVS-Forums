<div class="posttext">Man, what an improvement over ME! Except in one respect; Every time I try to use channelshift or color reduction (and I'm sure a few others I am not aware of), it crashes WA. UnConed has said that a lot of the 'old' Apes will crash in XP. I guess these are just a couple of them.:( <br />
<br />
Or is this something that shouldn't be happening (an issue with my comp).  I assumed the integrated Apes would work in the major OS's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Im not sure, but if i remember correctly there was some problem with those specific effects that if you had them both integrated and as .ape files in your AVS there could be some problems.<br />
<br />
Other than that, i think the 3D render apes (metaball &amp; tentacles) are sure to crash every time on winXP and UnConeD doesn't even want to fix them (and who can really blaim him for that?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think the blaim rests sqaurly on him<br />
<br />
after all who else's fault is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, I (and everyone else) certainly hopes for the day UnConeD updates his apes, but I also understand him not being in a hurry to do so. In the meantime, I believe all the shuffling of Apes I have done in the recent past may have scrambled things. Your suggestion, Tugg, has given me a place to start. (I agree with Pak-9, it IS the Ape maker's responsibility, is it not? Though like everyone has said, he is under no obligation.) <br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply, guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I ment you can't &quot;blaim&quot; him simply because those APE's are used too often for n00b-shiaz :p (not counting UnConeD for obvious reasons)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Delete the dupes (chshift, multiplier, colorreduction), the built-in versions don't crash. The 3D apes will continue to crash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's exactly what I thought, UnConeD. I am glad now that I weaned myself off of using the 3d apes. :D<br />
As for the duplicates, yeah my apes folder is actually a mess right now. Anyway, thank you.<br />
<br />
edit: Gad what an idiot I am! I read this thread again, and you explained first about the duplicates, Tugg, I was just too thick to grasp it. :mad: Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
