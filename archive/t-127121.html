      Hi!<br />
      <br />
      I have been trying for ages to make a DM that sorta takes whats on the screen and shifts it along a bit. Then, it'd take that and move it, so you end up with a kinda history bu with a DM. the effect is in whacko's cartoon trip.<br />
      <br />
      Once I have this bit sorted, I can put to work the other stuff I have learnt.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh, I'll include the relevant file (hopefully) in case of confusion.<br />
      the first DM has nothing to do with this specific effect though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm confused with what you are asking. What is it that you need help with??? Also, I would check the wrap box in the second DM.</p>

      roighty, the second DM simply shifts whats drawn in the effect list, I want it to shift it a small amount (which is easy) BUT then keep what's just been drawn when it comes round again. I think this effect could be achieved with a dynamic shift, but didn't think that it'd be able to do the complicated swirliness I hope to achieve. (That's what the random stuff in the 2nd DM's gonna be for)<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have tried, but failed! where would I stick both?<br />
      <br />
      P.S. again! i think it is to do with the first DM. if you divide by 5 at the end of they x=... and y=... in DM #2, and then take the first away and finally pop the second at the end of the effect list, you get better results. However, this still isn't the cartoon-trip "history" type effect i'm looking for. keep trying please!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Now i'm not sure what you're telling me!<br />
      <br />
      I shall try to explain:<br />
      <br />
      in whacko's preset "Cartoon Trip" (Whacko pack 4) The DMs shift the picture around, but as they shift and distort it, nothing gets removed, except by a different colour being shifted over it. In my e.g. the second DM simply translates the whole of the effect list, not the results of what it did previously.<br />
      <br />
      I know this is still vague! if you can look at the cartoon trip, it may be clearer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just don't use any clear screens and mess with the input for the effect list.<br />
      <br />
      Here's a remix I put together real quick. Disabled the DM inside the effect list as it caused anything that would carry over to be scrambled so you couldn't even tell.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ah. Just don't clear the screen. Cartoon Trip does't clear the screen, it just blends the colours out. For the liquid type DM I can't help you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nah, the other DM stuff will be coded randomly :D<br />
      is there any way to not use a fadeout, without loss of colour info?</p>

      <p class="post-content">???<br />
      <br />
      The way a fadeout work is by reducing the values of the colours unless you do an alpha fade with your DM.<br />
      <br />
      You could try this way. I used it in a preset before. It gives a nice tracer effect.</p>
