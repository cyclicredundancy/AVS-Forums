		My first post, and first preset! Tell me what you think! Any comments on improving is greatly appreciated. I dont know anything about math equations or anything like that yet, but I'm working on it. Anyway, here's my best effort at the moment, called &quot;Tunneling Fire&quot;.

		Decent effect, but your preset has some extra baggage.<br />
1.The Movement after the Effect List is set to none so it's not really doing anything<br />
2.Since you are only using 1 colormap you don't need it set to onbeat random<br />
3.The buffersave in the effect list isn't doing anything<br />
4.The invert on the end isn't doing anything, it could have been left in for different color scheme, but I'm not sure<br />
It is a good start though, I suggest you keep expereimenting with built in effects, then move on to things like Atero's AVS primer, the FAQ, and searching the fourms to learn how to start coding.

Yeah, I deleted the things that you said weren't necessary. Thanks for pointing that out. I put the invert there because it looks cool [to me] either way, so sometimes I switch it just for a change in look. Think of it as a special feature or something. Though, there's nothing really special about it.

		I went to one of my unfinished mixes of Tunneling Fire, and I played around with the movements, and Fire Flares was born! I dont know if I like this one, or the other one better. Take a look!

		Ah, hmm.  If you are gonna update your preset and change the name, you might wanna do a little more than that.  But it does look pretty decent.  It's good that you're expermenting.<br />
<br />
You have a mirror set to nothing - is this just an extra little thing to play with like the invert?  If not, it can be deleted.<br />
<br />
Made a remix (over the course of 3 hours) - no reason - just a mix :)

Well, it's not really an update. Just a different mix based on the same preset. And I just named it the first thing that came into my head.<br />
<br />
I like your remix!!!

		Awsome remix Magic.X! I really want to learn coding, but I want to become familiar with the render and transition effects and what can be done with them first. Then, coding I shall start!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the welcome Ishan_Rocky! <br />

Yee! I've allready got compliments from major dudes!!! :D  I feel more superior now!

		Are you saying that you're really gonna get into AVS?  Because you said you weren't before, but now it's seems like you do.  If that's the case, then cool! :winamp: :winamp: :winamp:

		Don't be getting excited by getting compliments from people with higher ratings, it's nothing special. It's just based on how many posts you have made in the forums, that's not to say you should post just for the sake of increasing your post count though, your rating or your post count does nothing for actual respect you'll get from other members. Ok enough 'welcome' rambling now.<br />
<br />
WELCOME TO THE FORUMS :)<br />
<br />
As for the preset it's very good for a first attempt, looks quite nice, it didn't give me a seizure ;) and it is fairly reactive. Good work, keep it up.

		Like raz said, postcount matters not.  I have more posts than any other regular in the AVS forums, but that means jack.  I'm ok at avsing, but I'm nowhere near as good as some of the people who have around 100 posts.

Thanks! Yeah, when I make a preset, I try to make it with 1 color scheme (I may have spelled scheme wrong), make it not too flashy. That way, I can make a n00bish preset, look not so n00bish. I'm glad it didnt give you a seizure! There are enough of those kind of presets allready! ;) :up:

		I have read posts here where people are getting flamed. So I'm learning the stuff to avoid before posting. Keeping things at a good communication level with the people here. And if I get flamed, then oh well. I'll learn.

				<i>Originally posted by Atero:</i> <b>:sigh: y'know, it's REALLY too bad I've been saying I've been good to newbies lately. Because I'm going to have to burn this one to a crisp  First point of business: Major dude has to do with how many posts you have. Anubis2003 has been here 3 months and has 3000-some posts, making him a Forum King. Tuggummi here has been here two years and has less than 500 posts, making him a Senior Member. I've been here a year and 8 months and have 1700-some posts, making me a Major Dude. Everyone here will agree that Tuggummi is a much more experienced AVS artist than either me or Anubis. The point being that post count and time registered does not make the AVSer. Second order of business: Remember when it said, in giant fucking flaming red letters to SEARCH THE FORUM BEFORE YOU POST? Remember that link to the AVS Frequently Asked Questions thread at the top of the forum? If you can't, go back and take a look at them. See how fucking impossible to miss they are? Well you did. You, my friend, are what we in the biz call a &quot;fucking moron&quot;. THIS IS THE GODDAMNED AVS FORUM. Don't you think SOMEBODY would've asked &quot;how I can AVS&quot; by now? USE YOUR HEAD.  Oh...and welcome to the AVS forum.</b></blockquote>
