<div class="posttext">I do not know if anyone read the (so-called) hacking quaterly 2600. The magizine that was once a useful resource in my younger days 'playing' with 'hacking' but now more a social injustice rant about DMCA, DeCSS, et all and letters pages. For Â£4.89 no less in the Uk!<br />
<br />
Anyway (my rant over) it has this quater (well the latest over here in the uk) - Spring 2002 - an 'article' on AVS and creating 3d presets. God only what it has to do with 2600 and hacking but anyway.<br />
<br />
Now although I do not have any 3d glasses so I cannot check out what diabolik has written. <br />
<br />
I wanted to know <br />
a) does it work? <br />
b) and what do you think the of 3d presets?<br />
c) Who is diabolik? Aren't all the AVS presets writers all friends and post here?!? :confused::):p:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
but d) most of all does this person know anything about AVS at all.<br />
<br />
In What you will need<br />
<br />
(A computer (....you should have a pretty good video card..) <br />
<br />
No wonder people keep posting the 'why is AVS slow' threads.:confused: :igor: <br />
<br />
Now I cannot be bothered typing all the preset in at the moment but it is worth at least reading the article if you can.<br />
<br />
Now there is a link to the preset but it does not work infact wosre than that it opens4 or 5 random adverts so no point posting it here. Which makes it even more annoying.<br />

<div class="posttext">Anyone know if it can be picked up in Canada? Sounds like it might be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">2600 is an american magizine. I sold all over the world a popular computer mag. Sorry I presumed everyone would know what it was :o(you will probably not know who 'hacker' Kevin Mitnick is either too). <br />
It has been going since the early 80's (2600 refers to old school  phone phreaking) so maybe I am just too old.:) <br />
<br />
you should have no problem picking it up all over Canada. <br />
<br />
see the website.<br />
<br />
www.2600.com<br />
<br />
if you really need to you could order online<br />
<br />
The AVS article is just a one off but you may find it interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm doesn't sound too advanced (with the 'fast video card' reference) and especially when it's in a hacking magazine. Isn't 2600 more related to phreaking and cracking though?<br />
<br />
In any case I don't have 2600 and don't intend to purchase one just for one AVS article :p. Do you have a scanner? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th June 2002, 01:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">On scanner I am afraid. Otherwise I would do that. Sorry. If you are in a newsagents it is worth checking out. it is only 2 small pages of A5.<br />
<br />
BTW I really have no idea what 2600 is about nowadays. It just calls itself 'The Hackers Quaterly' but it has outdone itself with the AVS 3d article about lack of relevance.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I usually try to get every 2600 when it comes out, I must've missed that one.  I could use that article.  <br />
<br />
2600 did tend to rant on and on about the decss and other shite, but it actually has a boatload of useful information.  For those who are interested, any Bibelot book store would have a copy, or even Border's Books.  It runs about $5 a pop, but I try to get mine at a 5 finger discount.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well the technique is very easy... just render the same image twice with the camera moved slightly to the left/right for the left/right eye, and of course one in red and the other in cyan. I tried it once with The Source in Whacko AVS II, it looks pretty cool, but not many people have those cheezy glasses :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh man, I knew I shouldn't have thrown that cheezy 3d glasses out when I was a little kid :cry:  :p <br />
<br />
Now, if only the &quot;The Hackers' Quarterly&quot; would just go really hacker-like and actually do some programming...<br />
<br />
*ponders for a few moments*<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, they're hackers, not mathematicians. Experts on guess-and-checking HUGE amount of possibilities.<br />
<br />
Now, if only I can get THAT edition (And possibly laugh at it or drop mah jaw of the silliness in it)...</div></div><hr />
