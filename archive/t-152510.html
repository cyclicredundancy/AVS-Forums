      <p class="post-content">You can overlay it over your background or just set it to fullscreen, but I dont think you can make it into your actual screensaver.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can someone explain why anyone would want anything other than blank screensaver?<br />
      <br />
      If you're not sitting at your pc to watch it, what's the point? Impress the co-workers?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would have posted any available english page if i found any...<br />
      BTW, just posted this for photos, there are no technical details included. All it says it that this case provides 20 heatpipes for cooling and should be available by october this year. Hav'nt seen it on any online store yet...</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could install winamp to your 'windows/system32' directory, run it for the first time and set AVS to overlay mode, then leave AVS running but minimize winamp then quit it from the right click context menu from the system tray icon. Then find winamp.exe in windows/system32 and rename it to winamp.scr and set it to your screensaver that way when your screensaver runs it will run winamp, but it will be minimized so it will just display the AVS overlayed onto your desktop. TADAAAAAAAAA.<br />
      <br />
      You and I both know that it wont work, but the theory is sound :P</p>
