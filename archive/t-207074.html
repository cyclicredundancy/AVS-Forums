Moved to AVS presets forum.<br />
<br />
Quite why you thought the rip forum was the best place for your question is beyond me...

Yeah, but before you go on your &quot;holyman&quot; phase, let me tell you that usually that stuff is junk &amp; small meteorites, which aren't that pleasant <b>at all</b> :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And UnConeD has made some <i>various</i> presets, but posting them here would violate the forum rules most likely ;)<br />
<br />
But yeah, he has pretty much quitted and ascended to a higher plane of existance beyond AVS.

 If you knew what they were talking about, you would be cool. Since you don't know what that was all about you're not cool. It's as simple as that. :p <br />
<br />
That meeeeeeeeans that Tug, Jaak, WOTL and me are the only 4 cool persons here. And maybe hboy. Dunno if he knows.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Mr. Jones, but he is above our category :eek: :cool: .<br />

No. But you can find lots of stuff not shown on <a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_blank">www.winamp.com</a> (on account of it has a crap AVS section) on <a href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">www.deviantart.com</a><br />

Now... lets hope I don't get banned for advertising the enemy. ;)<br />
