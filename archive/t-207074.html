Yeah, but before you go on your &quot;holyman&quot; phase, let me tell you that usually that stuff is junk &amp; small meteorites, which aren't that pleasant at all :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And UnConeD has made some various presets, but posting them here would violate the forum rules most likely ;)<br />
<br />
But yeah, he has pretty much quitted and ascended to a higher plane of existance beyond AVS.</div></div><hr />

 If you knew what they were talking about, you would be cool. Since you don't know what that was all about you're not cool. It's as simple as that. :p <br />

No. But you can find lots of stuff not shown on www.winamp.com (on account of it has a crap AVS section) on www.deviantart.com<br />
<br />
Now... lets hope I don't get banned for advertising the enemy. ;)<br />
