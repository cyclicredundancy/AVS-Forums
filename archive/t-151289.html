			<strong>Too slow!!!!</strong><br />
		
		

		Ok, here are my system specs<br />
<br />
Pentium 4 3.0 GHz w/800 FSB<br />
1 GIG PC3500 DDR400 MGhz RAM<br />
ATI Radeon 900<br />
<br />
<br />
Shouldn't my fullscreen visualizations be like, super fucking fast, and not be slow?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Is there anything that I can do to impove performace? does anyone know any software that might detect andresolve problems&gt;!?

		Search.  The.  Fucking.  Forums.<br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of this kind of post but this one is by far the most annoying I've come across in quite a while.  And with that kind of setup, yes, they should be fucking fast - unless you're looking for 3x milkdrop speeds (240 fps or something thereabouts).  Maybe you should give us some specifics next time instead of just whining that your vis aren't fast enough.

		Donni - stop the flaming.  Atero - don't flame back - you hopefully know better by now...<br />
<br />
Donni, had you searched the forums, you would have seen many other instances of this question being asked, with the same answer.  AVS is a complex application, that does an amazing amount of work.  YOu will not see it get high speeds in fullscreen with any modern PC.  20FPS is plenty good enough for it's purpose though - most people can't even get this, but you should be able to with the 3GHz.  Very little that you can do to make it faster - to figure out what, search the forums.

		If you want speed, choose Milkdrop or some stand alone visualization. But you can kiss variety a goodbye (tho with milkdrop is a bit like avs and has community of artists to support &amp; make new presets for it).<br />
<br />
Now if you want tens of thousands of different in any possible way range of visualizations and don't mind about the speed, choose avs, but don't whine about the speed thank you.<br />
<br />
It's just a question of what you prefer, Speed or Variety? You can't magically make it faster by installing something or changing this&amp;that.<br />
<br />
There is also the point to be considered that even though the hardware is getting faster &amp; faster, AVS artists too tend to do more and more complex &amp; smoother looking presets which of course leads to the fact that AVS still stays 'slow'. Everything is evolving, presets, hardware and artists themselves too.

		It is true that new AVS presets stay at about the same FPS rate all the time, but I still love going back and watching my paranoya and el-VIS stuff from way back.  They run at great FPS rates on my superbox.

			<strong>Same problem here</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm running an amd 3200+xp proc with 1gig corsair XMS pro memory and geforce 6800GT 256meg<br />
I start at like 40 then drop and sustain a 6.4fps<br />
to me that a bit low. even if It is just relying on processor power<br />

		I think the thing to remeber about AVS fulscreen is ALWAYS pixel double, there hasnt been a processor built that can run average presets 20+fps over 800x600 non-pixel doubled. I know my P4 @ 3.3Ghz cant :igor:
