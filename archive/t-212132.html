<div class="posttext">Here's the moment you've all been waiting for my newest pack, so here's 4 complimentery presets to show you what I've been working on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2005, 11:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">except that they are only 3 presets...<br />
<br />
do you want some feedback or is it just to show that you're still working on avs? :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dear Matt,<br />
<br />
First and foremost, these suck.<br />
A single SSC is not a preset.<br />
Secondly, as ^..^ said, there's only three.<br />
Now I'm not saying that there's absolutely no hope for you,<br />
but why not quit while you're ahead?<br />
If you must continue, you really ought to work on<br />
adding even a little bit of visual decency.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

<div class="posttext">okay...i know matt's an ass, and i want him to go away as much as anyone else (mainly because of his unmitigated stupidity).  that having been said, you are a total fucking cunt.  avs is already dying, we don't need you flaming people on account of their artistic efforts, no matter how bad you think they are.  i don't really give a damn about flaming, unless it's the kind of cold bullshit you just pulled.  if i were you, i wouldn't be educating other people on the concept of &quot;decency&quot; - and i shouldn't have to tell you that your opinions don't have nearly enough clout on this forum for you to form them the way that you did.<br />
<br />
so don't fucking do it again, prick. :hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">but still matt's presets are bad imo. although you can't deny that he's trying to (slowly) get better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry, but they're still not any better, well actually 'bargraphssc' is quite funny. btw 'science3D' is still missing a picture!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">To Matt and Atero:<br />
For whatever it may be worth, I apologize for my complete lack of morality. At the time I had not taken notice of how thoughtless the intent had been. I have no excuse for my actions, but I promise that in the future I will be much more careful in what I say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2005, 22:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that's funny: you apologize to matt for what you said to him...<br />
<br />
lol most of the time matt doesn't even know himself what he's writing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd April 2005, 22:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, I truthfully don't mean any real harm to anyone. At the time I had just thought it to be funny, but looking back it really was a cold and deceitful thing to say. Matt, I hope you can forgive my heartless actions, but if not I'll certainly understand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">btw 'science3D' is still missing a picture! i realised this after i put the new pack in :p &amp; as for denkensiefursic i don't actually care to heart or something...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so where is the bmp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, matt, I will not say you're the worst idiot i've ever met.<br />
I will not say these presets are the worst I've ever seen, and will not say that you should quit AVS'ing.<br />
<br />
But I am going to say that all other members on this forum are a lot furhter advanced than you are and that you have no right to dictate them, rather listen to advice instead of always choosing the defence.<br />
I repeat, listen to advice. Especially about things that have been mentioned before.<br />
<br />
About the presets: You've advanced but I sure won't be adding these to my permanent list. They're just not attractive. <br />
Try fiddling around with movements too, instead of just rendering (i.e. quickie).<br />
And a missing bitmap after even a second release.. now, that's bad :(<br />
<br />
and oh yea, a little offtopic but your artist name is neither in the presetname nor in the comment (as there is none). You might want to add that too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">tomylobo: you may aswell use any pic ... but i liked my default it up on my site soon (or ill upload it to winamp or ff / avs)...<br />
<br />
wotl: if you've been to #ff or #avs sometimes im there, i've tried to get a better understanding of the topic and did you notice the topic title &quot;MaTTFuRY v2 test-betaPreview&quot; and denkensiefursic attacked me (flamed) and apologized....</div></div><hr />
