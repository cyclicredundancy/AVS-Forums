<div class="posttext">Hi, :weird: I just got into AVS a month or so ago and have been trying to make some colorful stuff. Don't expect too much but tell me what you think.:up: :down:  I spend a lot of time designing computer games nowadays (my games (http://www.angelfire.com/mech/sam_carmichael/index.html)) so that should help me get the hang of it faster.:tinfoil: <br />
<br />
You can download my first set of visualizations here:<br />
Rainbowmania AVS preset (http://www.voicesoffaith.com/sabbathsoftware/storage/temp/SamsPics/SamsAVS.zip):winamp:  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well you seem to grasp the basic coding skill in AVS, what you lack in is: design, color manipulation, effects &amp; overall knowledge of what makes a good visualization, which is about everything else :igor:<br />
Not to sound harsh or anything, but im wondering is AVS really something you want to do? Even as a hobby one needs to get pretty in-depth before one can produce quality stuff, and after all AVS is pretty limited compared to what you might have been used to when coding with real programming languanges.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I concur, since it's been &quot;a while&quot; since i've used rainbow themes :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well even though most of you guys hate my work, I decided to tell those who are interested ...about another one I made, this one's 3d though, again please don't waste your time downloading it if you didn't like the first ones:<br />
Click here to download it! (http://www.winggamepak.com/stuff/peeramid.exe)<br />
(you need the data folder and the peeramid.dll in the Winamp: Plugins folder)<br />
http://www.winggamepak.com/stuff/peeramid.jpg <br />
I did check out your guys' visualizations by the way to see your styles....<br />
the http://nehe.gamedev.net contest had some good ones by the way<br />
<br />
and I have updated the games I made (they have 1400 downloads at shareware.com):www.winggamepak.com</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well. I would characterize these presets under the mysterious genre &quot;Concept&quot;. They are all a variation on one theme, and they only develop one aspect of AVSing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">-_-' you know sam_carmichael your going to end like i did when i first started out. and that is being the worst of the avsers. i;m not the best or the worst but i'm one of the aspiring good ones. but when i see a noob who starts to get angry about the responses he gets on his work i see myself in a downward spiral to the bottom. but listen to me if you want to improve don't get angry and accept the negative feed back. learning from your mistakes can open your view of AVS. I did exactly as you are doing right now.<br />
but when i learned to shut up and just listen to what the pros have to offer I can learn quite a bit. if you want to see some good uses of the rainbow theme effect look in Nanakiwurkz Versions 1 - 2 and you will see what i mean. I'm now doing 3d presets but to some degree.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What a waste of hw acceleration and seperate plugin... no offense but the screenshots looks like things AVS could produce in software.<br />
<br />
Also, its nicer if you start new threads. Resurrecting the old ones confuses people (me!) since the break in conversation is hard to spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">sam_carmichael: I strongly reccomend you open AVS, make some extremely simple presets (I'm talking render/simple + trans/movement) and just work on colours and asthetics. <br />
<br />
Pretty much everything you have every made needs to ship with a pair of depolarising glasses and seizure recovery kit. 100% saturated colours, no shading, no scheme, the RGB is just vomited over everything in a fulmination of colour.<br />
<br />
Here is some research material:<br />

<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">NemoOrange ftw<br />
<br />
and seriously, tropical oceans only look like that when you have taken too much acid. I like PAK's term &quot;fulmination of colour&quot;... if the colours were any stronger they might make my monitor fulminate.<br />
<br />
lol at depolarising glasses and seizure recovery kit.</div></div><hr />
