      <p class="post-content"><strong>Framerate in Fullscreen!! :((</strong><br />
      Hello, everyone! When I change to Fullscreen mode framerate kills me!<br />
      I don't know what to do.<br />
      I have P4 2000A with 768 mb DDR SDRAM &amp; Gforce 3 Ti 200 with 128 mb DDR. OS is Win XP pro.<br />
      I thought this will be enough, but I can't get pleasure from AVS.<br />
      Can anyone help???</p>

      In short, use 320x200.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nah, 320x240. Monitors have 4/3 aspect ratios, so use a matching resolution. The only reason they originally used 320x200 is because that would fit in 64k at 8-bit.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Personally I prefer 800x600 with pixel doubling (400x300). Only very simple or very efficient presets will ever run in high resolutions like 640x480, 800x600 or 1024x768 (without pixel doubling) and still be able to get reasonable fps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually UnConeD, it was 64,000 bytes, not 64k. I remember POKEing data into that array with QuickBasic lol!</p>

      <p class="post-content">He was only 1536 bytes out, thats not too bad.<br />
      <br />
      By the time I got to QBasic there was a PSET(x,y) function, it was very useful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But PSET and POINT were WAAAY slower, with an array I could peek and poke to copy the whole screen in about 1 second. (Then I learned GET and PUT (And then I found an external library for Mode 13 :D ))</p>

      <p class="post-content">I said 64k not 64K :).<br />
      <br />
      64k = 64000<br />
      64K = 65536<br />
      <br />
      That's why an MP3s bitrate it specified in kbps. An 128kbps MP3 has 128000 bits per second (B = byte, b = bit). Network bandwidth is 10Mbps (10 * 2^20 bits per second) or 100Mbps (100 * 2^20 bits per second).<br />
      <br />
      These used to be pretty standard, until PC's got popularized and harddisk manufacturers started to abuse this to make their disks look bigger.<br />
      <br />
      Now, it's supposed to be k,M,G = 1000^(1, 2, 3) and ki,Mi,Gi (Kibi, Mebi and Gibi) = 1024^(1, 2, 3) but it sounds awful.<br />
      Besides, you alredy spell 'kilogram', a 1000 grams, as kg and not Kg anyway :).<br />
      <br />
      The problem is SI (Syst&#195;&#168;me Internationale, standard for physics and such) has some capitalisation rules (m = milli, M = mega), but they don't make sense in PC units (a millibyte doesn't exist).</p>
