      <p class="post-content"><strong>fullscreen square window</strong><br />
      is it possible to have a square window fullscreen? It doesn't seem to contain the right resolution, also not with using vertical window size (in percent). It probably would be possible with horizontal window size, though there does not seem to be such a function.<br />
      <br />
      anyone any had this problem? any ideas are greatly appreciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">you could adjust the horizontal scale of your monitor (the monitor should have buttons or knobs that let you do this) although you have to do this manually whenever you exit or enter full screen mode... on some monitors that might be annoying to do</p>

      <p class="post-content">Coz I've some presets which only work good in square windows. For example Compact Disc, or Rollin'. I was wondering if there was a way the computer just displays a square fullscreen, two black bars on the sides acceptable (and unavoidable). Resizing the screen with the buttons doesn't work. I can make a square then, though the preset doesn't resize good with it.</p>
