      <p class="post-content">Raz, I like this DM a lot more. Good job speeding it up. However, It moves a bit too fast. It's kinda blinding when it moves that fast. At least have it accelerate smoothly. Also, there are still some weird lines that come up. I assume because of one of your DM's.<br />
      To keep it from fading to a solid color multiply the alpha by some number(experiment to find what you like). It is fading out because the "fog" is really close and can cover up most of the screen at times. By increasing alpha, the fog moves further away and the screen won't go black.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's pretty fast there. Anibus is right, it should change velocities more smoothly so you can actually see what's going on.<br />
      <br />
      I dunno about anyone else, but a quarter of the time, I can't really see anything because it's too dark. If you want a colour shifting background I'd suggest use a superscope to define the colour, it gives you more control.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok messed with the code a bit, fixed the alpha blending, i think. I got rid of one set of lines that were appearing, the other set i like and put into the DM intentionally.<br />
      <br />
      Its slowed down quite a lot and rotates more now. Tell me if its still going to fast, my computers really quite shite and it runs at a nice speed on it.<br />
      <br />
      Goood suggestion jaheckelsafar but i want to keep it part of the Dm because then the fog kinda matches the colours on the "surface type thing".<br />
      <br />
      And tell me if it still fades out because it dosent on mine and i cant tell. Still needs some work i think but here it is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It still looks fast, although I think it's because of the texture which changes very rapidly. It no longer fades out either. The lines are less noticible and look better now(either that or I am getting use to them). It's running at 25FPS in windowed 320x200.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok thanks for the suggestions ill work on it and repost it, ill go work on it on my other much better computer because it runs at a nice speed on this crap one, dosent run smoothly though. I dont already use it because its in my basement btw.<br />
      <br />
      lol on my "amazing" machine it runs at 6.1 FPS on 250x300. Pathetic aint it. If i use pixel doubling and resize it down so its going at 25 FPS all i see is changing colours, lmao im goin on my other machine.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hows this?</strong><br />
      On my other computer now. Holy crap that was fast and shite looking at 25 FPS. Slowed it down a lot and it was the other major DM speeding it up along with the last one. Ive slowed them both down a lot and looks much better now but i think the effect on the texture takes a little too long to appear properly.<br />
      <br />
      Oh yeah shoved something else i was working on in there, transfering it to my other computer, ignore that or whatever nowhere near done.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Still fast, but no longer hurts my eyes. I like the new texture a bit more too. I would increase alpha some - too much of the screen is fog.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Much improved. The planes move in opposite directions though. The same thing happened in my 'two planes' preset. You can make them move in the same direction by multiplying by the sign of your z value.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks a lot jaheckelsafar, that helped majorly. As far as im concerned this presets finished now (unless i decide to stick some sort of superscope in it when i can be bothered). looks better and the planes now run the same. Thanks for the suggestions and help guys. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The fog is still too close. Push it back some by multiplying alpha by some number(2,3,4,etc.). Much smoother now.</p>
