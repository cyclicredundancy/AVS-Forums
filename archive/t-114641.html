		Intro: 4 stars<br />
Could've been better, you really need to fix the logo so it works at all screensizes.<br />
<br />
Metablobs: 3.5 stars<br />
Extremely good effect, rather unreactive and low-quality, however.<br />
<br />
Metablobs cartoon: 2 stars<br />
I didn't notice a change except that you removed the depth.<br />
<br />
Metablobs radioactive: 4 stars<br />
Excellent remix!<br />
<br />
Swirling vortex: 3 stars<br />
Nice, but I don't see it reacting to anything except the beat, and it only changes color...is it just me?<br />
<br />
Realtime raytacer: 4 stars<br />
You don't really show off your ability in this one, mainly because the objects are too small.  I love the changing DM, though!<br />
<br />
Fireworks: 4.5 stars<br />
WOW.  Damn fine job here, Zeven.<br />
<br />
Single cell alien: 3.5 stars<br />
It's nice, but the metablobs preset are getting kind of old.<br />
<br />
Superellipsoid: 3 stars<br />
Great, but I think it could have been better implemented.  Now I can gloat at Jheriko, though... :p<br />
<br />
Milkdrop 2: 4 stars<br />
Excellent use of changing forms!<br />
<br />
Superellipsoid dark: 3.5 stars<br />
I like the change in background here<br />
<br />
Floating blocks: 4 stars<br />
Excellent preset, but you need to use a depth-buffer to shade the spheres so ones farther back don't get in front of ones closer up.<br />
<br />
Digital grey: 3 stars<br />
Nice, but not as nice as Milkdrop 2.<br />
<br />
Water drop: 2 stars<br />
It's not very reactive, except for the rotation, which is very choppy.<br />
<br />
Desert Sunset: 4 stars<br />
Very nice, that's all I can say ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 3.75 stars<br />
Technically excellent, but aestetically lacking in places.  Nice job, keep up the good work!

UnDefineD: I've submitted it to winamp.com, which means you should know how long it will take to appear :rolleyes:

		LOL, I meant on the forum. :p<br />
<br />
BTW, it's uN, not Un. :D I really shouldn't have done that, it's caused a lot of confusion. One guy called me UnDeFiNeD once.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Never mind, DA is up again.

		All right Zev, here's my detailed review:<br />
<br />
<b>Intro:</b> <i>Excellent</i> use of superscopes, and I liked the meter as well. Personally I thought it looked better without the Invert, but anyway. 3.5/5<br />
<b>Metablobs:</b> Wow, what a great effect! This definitely rivals the Metaballs APE. I had terrible slowdown (~ 3fps) but that's gotta be expected I guess. 4/5<br />
<b>MetablobsCartoon:</b> Just looks the same to me, although the celshading effect isn't bad. 3.5/5<br />
<b>MetablobsRadioactive:</b> Alright, it's not funny anymore. :) I think this one's the best out of the Blobs bunch. 4/5<br />
<b>SwirlingVortex:</b> Excellent coding and a nice overall effect. But it's a bit too dark, and some extra dynamics couldn't have hurt. 3.5/5<br />
<b>Realtime Raytracer:</b> GM Chrysler! You can really code. I would've put this to a better use, but the fantastic techwork more than makes up for it. 4.5/5<br />
<b>Fireworks:</b> Another great example of coding. I 'unno, I'm really lost for words about this. 4/5<br />
<b>SingleCellAlien:</b> A bit similar to the Blobs presets, but the overall effect is fantastic. 3.5/5<br />
<b>SuperEllipsoid:</b> The colourcoding in the SSC here is phenomenal, as is the occasional seperating of the two sections. Still, the preset is a bit too static. 4/5<br />
<b>Milkdrop2:</b> Yet another example of your technical prowess and a nice flavour of aesthetic beauty. The transitions are spot-on. 4/5<br />
<b>SuperEllipsoid Dark:</b> Looks good with the Invert, but it's almost identical to the original. 3.5/5<br />
<b>FloatingBlocks:</b> Coupled with the gradient BG, these objects give a great effect.	A little blocky though (excuse the horrible pun). 4/5<br />
<b>DigitalGrey:</b> Great swirly movements, and the mosaic is a very nice touch. 4/5<br />
<b>WaterDrop:</b> The plane jerks a bit, but it's still one of the finest examples of coding I've seen. 4/5<br />
<b>Desert Sunset:</b> A very original idea, and it's pulled off almost perfectly. I was going to suggest that the canyon be assymetrical, but I see it's unavoidable. 4.5/5<br />
<br />
<b>The verdict:</b> This is probably the best AVS pack I've had the pleasure of reviewing. Your coding abilities are right up there with UnConeD and EL-VIS, and your preset ideas are very original. Just don't repeat them too much! :)<br />
<br />
<b>Aesthetics:</b> :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
<b>Abilities:</b> :) :) :) :) :( 1/2<br />
<b>Originality:</b> :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
<b>Overall:</b> :) :) :) :) :(

Now, does ANYONE have any trouble viewing that? Now, I've triple-checked the installer and it installs the required APEs as well, so I have no idea what the staff reviewer is on about. If anyone has had problems with either my pack, or the staff not installing packs correctly, then post it here.<br />
<br />
(If you're wondering how I tested it, I replaced the AVS folder with a blank one, and installed it.)

		If you don't restart AVS after installing a new pack, it doesn't see the new APEs. That's probably what happened.

		None of the AVS metablob effects can rival my metaballs though, for the simple fact that they are 2D, not 3D :). I know this isn't very noticable on the APE because of the bad shading, but I just compiled a version that rotates the mesh around a random axis, causing it to look much more 3D :).
