<div class="posttext">Intro: 4 stars<br />
Could've been better, you really need to fix the logo so it works at all screensizes.<br />
<br />
Metablobs: 3.5 stars<br />
Extremely good effect, rather unreactive and low-quality, however.<br />
<br />
Metablobs cartoon: 2 stars<br />
I didn't notice a change except that you removed the depth.<br />
<br />
Metablobs radioactive: 4 stars<br />
Excellent remix!<br />
<br />
Swirling vortex: 3 stars<br />
Nice, but I don't see it reacting to anything except the beat, and it only changes color...is it just me?<br />
<br />
Realtime raytacer: 4 stars<br />
You don't really show off your ability in this one, mainly because the objects are too small.  I love the changing DM, though!<br />
<br />
Fireworks: 4.5 stars<br />
WOW.  Damn fine job here, Zeven.<br />
<br />
Single cell alien: 3.5 stars<br />
It's nice, but the metablobs preset are getting kind of old.<br />
<br />
Superellipsoid: 3 stars<br />
Great, but I think it could have been better implemented.  Now I can gloat at Jheriko, though... :p<br />
<br />
Milkdrop 2: 4 stars<br />
Excellent use of changing forms!<br />
<br />
Superellipsoid dark: 3.5 stars<br />
I like the change in background here<br />
<br />
Floating blocks: 4 stars<br />
Excellent preset, but you need to use a depth-buffer to shade the spheres so ones farther back don't get in front of ones closer up.<br />
<br />
Digital grey: 3 stars<br />
Nice, but not as nice as Milkdrop 2.<br />
<br />
Water drop: 2 stars<br />
It's not very reactive, except for the rotation, which is very choppy.<br />
<br />
Desert Sunset: 4 stars<br />
Very nice, that's all I can say ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall: 3.75 stars<br />
Technically excellent, but aestetically lacking in places.  Nice job, keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero: 5 stars for your detailed review :)<br />

UnDefineD: I've submitted it to winamp.com, which means you should know how long it will take to appear :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">LOL, I meant on the forum. :p<br />
<br />
BTW, it's uN, not Un. :D I really shouldn't have done that, it's caused a lot of confusion. One guy called me UnDeFiNeD once.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Never mind, DA is up again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">All right Zev, here's my detailed review:<br />
<br />
Intro: Excellent use of superscopes, and I liked the meter as well. Personally I thought it looked better without the Invert, but anyway. 3.5/5<br />
Metablobs: Wow, what a great effect! This definitely rivals the Metaballs APE. I had terrible slowdown (~ 3fps) but that's gotta be expected I guess. 4/5<br />
MetablobsCartoon: Just looks the same to me, although the celshading effect isn't bad. 3.5/5<br />
MetablobsRadioactive: Alright, it's not funny anymore. :) I think this one's the best out of the Blobs bunch. 4/5<br />
SwirlingVortex: Excellent coding and a nice overall effect. But it's a bit too dark, and some extra dynamics couldn't have hurt. 3.5/5<br />
Realtime Raytracer: GM Chrysler! You can really code. I would've put this to a better use, but the fantastic techwork more than makes up for it. 4.5/5<br />
Fireworks: Another great example of coding. I 'unno, I'm really lost for words about this. 4/5<br />
SingleCellAlien: A bit similar to the Blobs presets, but the overall effect is fantastic. 3.5/5<br />
SuperEllipsoid: The colourcoding in the SSC here is phenomenal, as is the occasional seperating of the two sections. Still, the preset is a bit too static. 4/5<br />
Milkdrop2: Yet another example of your technical prowess and a nice flavour of aesthetic beauty. The transitions are spot-on. 4/5<br />
SuperEllipsoid Dark: Looks good with the Invert, but it's almost identical to the original. 3.5/5<br />
FloatingBlocks: Coupled with the gradient BG, these objects give a great effect.	A little blocky though (excuse the horrible pun). 4/5<br />
DigitalGrey: Great swirly movements, and the mosaic is a very nice touch. 4/5<br />
WaterDrop: The plane jerks a bit, but it's still one of the finest examples of coding I've seen. 4/5<br />
Desert Sunset: A very original idea, and it's pulled off almost perfectly. I was going to suggest that the canyon be assymetrical, but I see it's unavoidable. 4.5/5<br />
<br />
The verdict: This is probably the best AVS pack I've had the pleasure of reviewing. Your coding abilities are right up there with UnConeD and EL-VIS, and your preset ideas are very original. Just don't repeat them too much! :)<br />
<br />
Aesthetics: :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
Abilities: :) :) :) :) :( 1/2<br />
Originality: :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br />
Overall: :) :) :) :) :(</div></div><hr />

Now, does ANYONE have any trouble viewing that? Now, I've triple-checked the installer and it installs the required APEs as well, so I have no idea what the staff reviewer is on about. If anyone has had problems with either my pack, or the staff not installing packs correctly, then post it here.<br />
<br />
(If you're wondering how I tested it, I replaced the AVS folder with a blank one, and installed it.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you don't restart AVS after installing a new pack, it doesn't see the new APEs. That's probably what happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">None of the AVS metablob effects can rival my metaballs though, for the simple fact that they are 2D, not 3D :). I know this isn't very noticable on the APE because of the bad shading, but I just compiled a version that rotates the mesh around a random axis, causing it to look much more 3D :).</div></div><hr />
