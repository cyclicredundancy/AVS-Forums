			<strong> What is your favorite bad review?</strong><br />
		
		

		After looking at the the WA skins thread <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=93380" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=93380</a> I thought it would to be fun see what you people think is the funniest idiotic comment that you have even seen on an AVS review.<br />
<br />
I will start the ball rolling for me it has to be:<br />
<br />
Whacko AVS IV<br />
<br />
Vincent Mostert gave it   <br />

		my favourite(s) is by Mohammed Ali Rezpanah, y'all know who he is, i don't need to explain more<br />
<br />
review's like that and other stuff made me to stop releasing stuff on winamp.com, i believe that 1 deviantart download is worth 100 winamp.com downloads.

		True Montana... In Winamp.com, people who download our packs are passerbies looking for good plug-ins. Remember, AVS preset listings are not sorted in date, thus causing the people who looks for good recent plugins get a lot of AVS presets in the way.<br />
They thought it's wourthwhile, and even the best of AVS can't help them - They compare it to other &quot;better&quot; plugins.<br />
In Deviantart, it's a whole new section, you can sort it, and the only people who go there (hopefully) are those who wants AVS presets, not some passerbies.<br />
<br />
Favorite lame comment? Hmm, dunno... But there's always a person who gives hoaxes about not downloading the Whacko series as a review on it... I don't remember whether it's different people or the same person though... such wicked mind...
