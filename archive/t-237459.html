      <p class="post-content"><strong>Advanced Visualization Studio v2.81b Stopped Working</strong><br />
      AVS v2.81b [vis_avs.dll] stopped working recently. It still shows up in my list of visualization plug-ins but when I click it, it doesn't start. AVS v2.3.2 [vis_ava.dll], and several others, including Geiss, Milkdrop and Acidspunk still work. AVS editor doesn't show up on the scroll list of presets that show up when you right click the visualization window. I've checked all the forums, reinstalled Winamp, got the latest and sure hate to do a clean reinstall. Attached are my specs. It seems to have started when I installed Avast! virus scan. Please help. I'm not very savy with this stuff, but love the presets incredibly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you checked the forums so thoroughly I'm sure you tried deleting vis_avs.dat, and I'm sure you found out that your machine's specs won't help us in diagnosing this either...<br />
      <br />
      Try deleting vis_avs.dat, if that doesnt help delete the vis_avs.dll and replace it from a reinstall or whatever.<br />
      <br />
      If that doesnt help, try removing all of the .apes from your avs directory. If an APE fails to load correctly it can have all kinds of annoying side effects.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I think a better tip (that you prolly don't want to hear) would be to remove Avast! virus scan. Since I have never heard of it or needed to use it to deal with a virus problem... its quite likely redundant. There are lots of other tools out there which prolly won't interfere with AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Its possible that its clamping down on the code execution AVS does from memory. Its the sort of thing viruses do, and naive programmers don't see as being genuinely useful, so a lot of virus checkers clamp on it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Having the AV resident certainly WILL interfere with AVS, if for no other reason than its stealing clocks away from AVS. There is no reason to have AV resident on a box anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Listen to jheriko and heed: deleting the .dat file should put you right.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks to Jheriko and hornet777. I'll be honest and had not tried deleting vis_avs.dat nor vis_avs.dll. I suppose I had thought a new reinstall of winamp overwrote those files, but evidently they retain themselves. That nor deleting the ape files helped. Yes, I uninstalled the Avast! program, which had apparently screwed up things. I did a whole clean uninstall/reinstall per forum directions. Works! Nothing like having AVS and AVS editor back! Cleaning up is good. My gluttony had led to a bunch of clutter anyway. Now I can start downloading presets again. A clean start. Lesson: don't install useless junk.</p>
