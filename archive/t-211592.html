      <p class="post-content"><strong>submission problems?</strong><br />
      The first time I've bothered to look for my packs on winamp in about six months/ a year i guess... they aren't there. I try to resubmit it tells me they are already there. They don't show up in my Published Items list. They don't show up on the list of all AVS, I checked back to 2002 manually. Older AVS packs by artists who quite likely do not maintain their work or visit winamp.com are still up on the site, so I doubt it was something automatic and intentional. They don't show up in the plugins search (which they used to), so why can I not resubmit them, surely the name duplication checking uses the same database as the search? (that last one is a total guess)<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone know what happened or if I missed something totally obvious?<br />
      <br />
      Very annoying anyway...</p>

      <p class="post-content">did you submit them to the components page from winamp3 days? unfortunately (!), these were never merged with the plugins section, which includes all the old plugins from winamp 1&amp;2 days.<br />
      <br />
      other than that, the search feature didn't work for me lately, maybe it's just that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The winamp plugins web system is really crap anyway, go to the plugins front page and see PAK-9 AVS 4 sitting there, then search for PAK-9 or PAK-9 AVS 4.... search results: none.</p>
