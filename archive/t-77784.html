      <p class="post-content"><strong>how long to be published?</strong><br />
      hey i was wondering how long it took between you putting your site on winamp.com to the actual publishing. My first preset got published two days after i put it on the site, but the one i just put up now has been waiting for publication for the last week and a half.<br />
      <br />
      Just trying to see what the average wait time is.</p>
