			<strong>Hypercube</strong><br />
		
		

		after seeing unconed's wolfenstein 3d preset, i was wondering if somebody could do a hypercube as seen in the movie cubeÂ². a similiar dynamic movement flying through equally looking rooms.

		PAK-9 already has made one.It's not the greatest though. So maybe a better one could be made?

		:mad: AHEM.  <b>I</b> did one that was fully dynamic and rotated around every axis.  PAK-9's (which was after mine, FYI) was a shitty little thing that required 24 superscopes and only went around one axis, and at a constant speed, if I'm correct.

		Anubis, the honor for hypercube (And almost supercube) goes to Atero. Praise him! (I can't believe I typed that...)<br />
<br />
Anyways, are you talking about a DM going through 8 cubes, with a 4d-ish arrangement? (Impossible in 3d, I believe - unless exchanging shapes) Then it's best to use several cubes with holes in middle as doorways - But the concept of that alone will certainly be not easy and will be slow... Now putting the holes in...<br />
<br />
I never saw the movie &quot;cube^2&quot; - Can you point me out?<br />
<br />
P.S. : If it involves rotation up and down... It'll be *really* slow.

		Sorry Atero, I don't have your hypercube.  For some reason I have pak-9's though.  Yours is better.

		okay: i've done two really original things in AVS.  that's my cellular automata and that's my 4D shapes.  those are MINE.  when someone tries to take that away from me i get a little pissed, okay?

		Depends which four dimensions you mean...<br />

For W, then it would be atero.<br />
But the king of T? Who will it be...?

		yeah, you would, wouldn't you...what about G?  probably unconed.  T would be unconed too.  X, Y, and Z...unconed.  W is still mine.

		I gues that whith 't' you probably mean time (even if there is no reason to look at time as a dimension in avs) but is 'g' gravity or what is it?

		T is time, G is gravity...there're more physical dimensions (around 11 total if I'm correct) but I'm not quite sure what they are :)

		They would make it hard to use the t variable.  If you didn't make t increment by like .00000000000000000001 then it would be too fast to watch.:p That would be awesome speed.

		Then pow(10,-15) will be all too common =P<br />
<br />
Quantum comps use &quot;Universal Position&quot; - This allows trinary, instead of binary way to store and calculate data - Trust me, it's that much better. The only problem is that it's goddamned hard to keep atoms (Or was it a few steps smaller?) at that state... (Good ol' Popular Science magazine)<br />
<br />
Other ideas include DNAs (Quite radical...) and some others I forgot.<br />
<br />
Oh, Atero, didn't you get pretty close to V (Or whatever is after W)?<br />
<br />
I'd like to see someone post a website(s?) about the other 11...

		I used U because V obviously didn't work for me :) And yes, I almost did.  I started on the 5-cube but I never got it working right.  It was too complex anyway, I doubt anyone would've liked it much when it was finished.
