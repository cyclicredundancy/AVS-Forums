		Hi There!<br />
<br />
First of all I have to say that the programmers of the AVS are doing some really fine Work.<br />
<br />
What I am kindly asking for is a feature to render AVS-output into high quality AVI-files.<br />
<br />
I know that it is possible to capture the output of the AVS with Screen capture programs - BUT - you have very low framerates and the size of the plugin has to be really small.<br />
What I would need is the possibility to render the AVS-Output in full DVD-quality (PAL 720*576 @ 25 fps). I would like to use these files to produce (parts of) music videos. There is no GFX-program out there for doing anything like this spectacular.<br />
<br />
This would be a nice feature for all people that want to run their Music on Standalone DVD/VCD/SVCD-Players with full-screen AVS-GFX on their TV. Or in Disco use with a LCD-projector!<br />
<br />
It does not have to be in realtime. Also it would be very fine to render the audio into the avi, but this is not that important.<br />
<br />
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Include that feature in the next Release.<br />
<br />

		I agree its a good idea in principle, but you'd have to associate the preset with an audio file so it could react with it - you couldn't change the music as it would be rendered in with the avi.
