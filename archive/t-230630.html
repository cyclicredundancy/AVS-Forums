      increased robustness generally; better exception handling, et cetra. I know its not horrible, but it could be better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'll agree with that. AVS crashes often while I'm editing (I suspect a threading or pointer issue), and it always takes WinAmp with it. (Doesn't WinAmp have an exception handler that's supposed to prevent this?)<br />
      <br />
      I have noticed, though, that the crashes happen much less frequently (but still occasionally) when I dock the visualization in the editor... but still, if it was one of my programs, once would be too many!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heh, the only way around this is to save, and save often... like every couple minutes. And it may or may not help, but I change the filename ever so slightly every time, such as adding a letter or an increasing number every time, so that I can look back to see if there was something I had that I thought was useless, then deleted or changed it, and later thought it would be a nice addition.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I do that too [the filename changing thing] but not too often since my folder gets crowded waaaay to much then.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I haven't lost anything, just sproadic crashes in the middle of playing. Actually it does have a more robust exception handler than previously, but it would be good if it didn't have to be used as often. :-) Thanks for the "docking" tip.</p>
