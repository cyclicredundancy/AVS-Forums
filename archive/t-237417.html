<div class="posttext">Moved into the right place, this pack is still good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, I downloaded PimpBot and I'll be releasing it officially tomorrow. It has about 23 presets in total, and I think is pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you will too.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, everyone seems to be having some trouble. Be patient. Hopefully, it'll get sorted out soon.<br />
<br />
The pack is pretty good for a newbie pack. I kinda liked &quot;Wavy acid bars&quot;... though I felt like ripping you apart when I saw that Random Flashes preset. Get that abomination out of the pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think the 20th preset titled as - Psychedelic Ham needs something..<br />
<br />
//here is what had I made just now..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's actually version 2 of Random Flashes. The first one didn't even have anything to look at.  I'll work on it, if you want me to.  Maybe a moving mirror bubble?  I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">j2krei08</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th April 2006, 19:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, taking advice from some, I removed RANDOM FLASHES (it wasn't even complete, silly me :rolleyes: )but I made a new one. Oh, and PH was changed based on JaVS' awesome remix.  <br />

<div class="posttext">Alrighty, I was able to log in this morning and quick submit it for publishing :D .  You should see it in a few days, and then you should rate it at least 4 stars. If not, then you should prepare to run quickly away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">j2krei08</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th May 2006, 19:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, it says it's published but I can't find it. The newest is from April 8th. Is it just me, or are people not posting, or are the Winamp guys slowing down in their job?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th May 2006, 19:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ZmoG, lolz, the &quot;Winamp guys&quot; are slowing down so wes hould sue AOHell LOLz!1!11 :winamp: :cry: <br />

If you MUST know, we couldn't access the part of the website where we review for weeks, then we couldn't download anything waiting there, and it was fixed recently, and everything was reviewed. The plugins are still not showing, but they will soon enough.<br />
<br />
Everyone is doing their job the best and the fastest they can, so don't whine, please.<br />
<br />
Might've overreacted, sure, and I apologize if I have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wasn't whiny, I was ignorant. I don't usually hang out on these forums and some things I don't really pay attention to, and the main winamp.com page never says anything about current status.:drool:<br />
<br />
EDIT: So, when will these reviews be viewable? I want to see how my pack rated:D !</div></div><hr />
