<div class="posttext">some nice presets in the pack, my favorites are 'gridlock' and 'sound blocks'. however, i expected a bigger pack and maybe some better colors (though that's a personal taste thing!).<br />
<br />
the 'mr. dj' preset doesn't seem to work properly in fullscreen, i don't see the blue frames. and poor records, needles mounted like this certainly destroy them quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the flickering in simple visions is annyoing,<br />
sound blocks is very stripped down &amp; simple yet nice<br />
sharp edges is also nice, like the special twist to it<br />
gridlock is also nice<br />
lunar mist is cool but i think the background needs to have some reaction the smoke,</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Gridlock is a great preset. But two versions of a preset almost the same one ofter the other just looks crappy. Should have the option to change it to slower and more detail in the same preset. Lunar mist is very cool too.<br />
<br />
I did think the colours were too similar in all the presets though.<br />
<br />
Good stuff, progress. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">especially like 'lunar mist'! nice choice of colors! 'gridlock' is also done very well; appreciate the shadowed version. (i agree with raz: one gridlock version would be enough. but there are worse things happening in the world...) i also like 'plasma rings'! it's smooth and uses cool blue tints.:cool: <br />
Have the problem with the blue background in 'Mr. DJ' too: every change between fullscreen and windowed (or vice versa) erases the background, certainly is a buffer problem. 'Sound blocks' could need some moving background (in my eyes). And there seems to be a small bug in 'control': it has got a fourth control mode, but i haven't found the keys for it, jet ;)<br />
<br />
On the whole it's a well made preset pack. :up: Keep up your work!<br />
(...wish my presets would be as half as nice. :hang: )</div></div><hr />
