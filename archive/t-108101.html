      <p class="post-content"><strong>The whole Overlay deal.</strong><br />
      Alright, my friend showed me how to set up the avs on your background, and i looked through the forums, and that's what he did. Anyways, now i was going through the settings and such, and i found the resolution, and stuff like that. i read in a few posts that you can only have the background overlay mode running with the little AVS window opened. I would like to know if this is true, because that sucks, cause the only way to get a better resolution is to make the window bigger, which has no point since it's on me background.<br />
      <br />
      So here's what i want to know:<br />
      <br />
      1. Is there a way to get it on the background without the little window?<br />
      <br />
      2. What does the 'fullscreen overlay mode' mean?<br />
      <br />
      3. Can i set the resolution i want to play the background AVS at ?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Pardon me if this has been answered somewhere, but i couldn't find it.Any answer to any of these questions would be most honoured.</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. No, but if you minimize winamp the AVS window goes too, and you still get the overlay signal going to your desktop.<br />
      <br />
      2. it uses the overlay signal for fullscreen insted of doing it the normal way. I find it degrades the picture, and the colours aren't quite right.<br />
      <br />
      3. Yes, you set the resolution by changing the size of the AVS window (as you have read elsewhere). Winamp just takes whatever is in the AVS window and send that to the overlay signal, which is then strecthed that to fill your desktop. Bigger AVS window = bigger picture sent to the overlay = higher resolution AVS on your desktop.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>One more thing</strong><br />
      Thanks guys for the information. Now i just have one more thing... if only i could remember what it was...<br />
      <br />
      just a sec...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh yeah. Okay, i remeber that the cool drawings, or visualiztions, or whatever they're called used to cycle randomly. i didn't like that so i took it off. now i found the options for switching between songs, and i selected it. But it doesn't switch at all.<br />
      <br />
      Does this have to do anything with the pre-init things above it, or the fact that the tracks fade into each other ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">You've made a little mistake.<br />
      <br />
      The transitions option is for changing presets, it does a wipe of somekind when you change presets, it doesn't change the presets for you when you change track.<br />
      <br />
      You can't actually make it change every track.</p>

      <p class="post-content">to turn random on:<br />
      <br />
      1. open avs editor<br />
      2. open settings menu<br />
      3. select presets/hotkeys<br />
      4. make sure the random chechbox is checked<br />
      5. if it isn't, do so</p>
