<div class="posttext">Wow. Am I the only one who thinks &quot;UnConeD&quot; is full of shit? That dude is stuck so far up his own ass, I'm worried whether he'll ever see the light of day. Does he do good AVS? Yeah sure, I'll give him that much. But as far as him acting like this superior human/demi-god type character is some funkin' psychotic ass shit. Who gives a fuck about AVS anyways? So, in closing, UnConeD (whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean) is a diabolical forum tyrant who is unhealthily full of himself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so you think UnConeD is full of shit, well, then i have to say that YOU is full of shit, Unconed is a master of avs, i can thank him for many things, first of all, i thank him for his impressive visuals, then i would like to thank him for the numoroes full instructions he done in the forums, he does much for those who want help with semiadvanced/advanced things, and then i thank him for doing such kick-ass wallpapers<br />
<br />
so Fuck you jimmy_janx</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Please point me to the posts where I am 'full of shit'. If you are referring to the &quot;Line Input + Beat-detection&quot; thread, it's just a joke... and *you* lack a sense of humor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey leave the guy alone. He's great at what he does. I kinda thought registering just to make an ass out of yourself was a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
BTW I'm aware that my alias is freakingly similar to yours UC, but I swear to God it was a mad coincidence!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th April 2002, 19:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">haha I don't mind, because I'm *not* an ass :D :D ... 'undefined' is an english word, 'unconed' is not :).<br />
<br />
I just can't believe anyone would read the thread mentioned and actually believe it was meant seriously. :p<br />
Here's a nice list of more of this kind of stuff (not by me :)):<br />

<div class="posttext">This Jimmy Janx character is a fag. I mean, who comes on a winamp message board and talks shit about someone who does a great service to everyone who uses AVS. How lame is your life when you go through the threads and form this ignorant ass opinion on someone who has never done anything to you. A truly pathetin display of ego that is.<br />
<br />
p.s. to unconed<br />
I think you're pretty fucking talented.</div></div><hr />
