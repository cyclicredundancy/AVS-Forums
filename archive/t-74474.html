<div class="posttext">Hi Guiz!                            (excuse my English ;))<br />
<br />
I am using AVS on Psy Trance Parties to project it on a large screen via Video Beamer. <br />
The trouble is, that i think it's really stupid to turn on my PC, start Winamp-AVS and clicking some hotkeys to switch the presets.<br />
I want full control power on my Presets. It would be great if anyone could write a plugin that enables me to increases or decreases the var's of the preset running actually. As i use 2 graphic cards, the best thing i could imagine is a controll form on my second screen that lists all var's that are actually in use and gives me something to control their size, manually as well as automatically by some kind of script, while AVS runs in Fullscreen mode on my first screen.<br />
Hope to get some good ideas! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Best of luck my friend. People come around here all the time asking for some kind of preset management tool, but there isn't one available. Furthermore, don't qutoe me on this, but I don't know if one even CAN be coded from what I understand about how AVS works internally. The most you can do is put all the presets you want to display in a certain directory and then set that directory to random play. Sorry I can't help more. :(</div></div><hr />

Try the beat reactive MilkDrop plug-in. A worthy replace for AVS.<br />
<br />
http://www.nullsoft.com/free/milkdrop/<br />
<br />
and then<br />
<br />
http://www.milkdrop.co.uk for more presets.<br />
<br />
It has a preset rating system and if you goto:<br />

<br />
At the bottom is the v1.02 beta 2. Which has a load of VJ options like text ,etc to be displayed live on screen.<br />
<br />
Sorry AVSers if that seemed like a shameless, gratuitous plug there but it might be the best option for him.;)<br />
<br />
Try it you will not be disappointed. I hope it helps.<br />

I allready downloaded it yesterday, gonna check it out this evening. Sometime ago i had talked to Bas, who had programmed ComControl, and another guy who wrote a Plugin very similar to it. I asked both of them if they could modify their Plugins to control AVS - var's. The latter one told me, that the problem is AVS does'nt provides its API and only a experienced hacker could do something like that but it would run very instabile. I just can't believe that there's no way! :confused:<br />
Let's call Justin and comply a bit!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think you'll be pleased with milkdrop. Especially if you have a good computer with a good 3D card. As for getting a hold of Justin, or anyone at WinAmp for that matter.... GOOD LUCK! :D They don't usally respond.</div></div><hr />

I checked it out but in fact its not what i'm looking for... the VJ option as just good for loading presets (as far as i found out). what annoys me the most is that i can't open the config window while md's running. In AVS i have the possibility to play around with the effects and see immediatly what it does (with some monstrous Algorithms, you just c'ant imagine any longer what it 'll look like...). And there are also things i miss in MD, for example some weird color effects, you can do by combining Water and Movement Transitions. At all i'll at least try a bit longer to get that damn thing to work the way i want it to, but i consider the chance of beeing succesfull very low. <br />
I think the only way to let me dreams come true is 'reeinventing the wheel', i mean someone who's clever enough could write a plugin just like AVS but with extended functions and a handle for other programms or plugins that could modify it while it's active. Unfortunately i can't do it on my, although i do some small programming jobs in delphi. I'm just not experienced enough in those things...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try the &quot;m&quot; key in MD to do real-time preset editing. It's all keyboard based, but it's relatively easy to use. Check out www.milkdrop.co.uk for heaps more presets too...</div></div><hr />
