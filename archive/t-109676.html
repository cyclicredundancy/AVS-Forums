      I finaly got my intro into the viz. It used to be 8 megabytes its now only 96 kb. Which is a major diffrents All you have to do is copy the folder thats in the zip folder into your program files folder and it will do the rest. Don't Worry about it overwriting anything...it wont. :)<br />
      These AVS are From Matt's Viz 1 &amp; Matt's Viz 2. It's fairly small, but hey with school and me not even knowing how to make a superscope it's hard, but fun if it works out.</p>

      Seriously though, if you're thinking of putting it up on winamp.com, don't. It will get ripped apart and horribly mangled by the frothing masses. If it's just for fun, it's great. As long as you like it. :)<br />

      The new intro was decent enough. :up:</p>
