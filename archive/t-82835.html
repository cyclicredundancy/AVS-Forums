      Well, here is my first attempt at making AVS presets. Take a look if you wish and feel free to give any feedback.<br />
      BTW, I dont know what the code of conduct is so i will make it clear that some of the superscopes are just modded default settings, just so i give credit to those who deserve it. Thanks, enjoy and let me know what u think.;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you use someone else's work, the easiest way to give credit is to include a simple 'Misc / Comment' in your preset. I'm not sure exactly who made those default settings though, though for default settings usually credit is not given.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, you should clean-up your presets a bit... there's a custom BPM in there that's not enabled, so you can leave it out. And the dynamic movement code in Black and White contains a typo:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>d=<font color="crimson">.</font>rand(3)</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      Not bad at all by the way...
