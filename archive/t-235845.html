			<strong>AVS animated wallpaper troubleshooting</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Hi there,<br />
<br />
  I've been all over this forum trying to find a solution with the overlaying of the visualizations on my wallpaper.  I have gone into the AVS editor and under the Display setting checked off both the Overlay option and desktop option.  Unfortunately to no success have I been able to activate this option.  I have read that disabling both the desktop wallpaper and active desktop maybe in order, but having done so I still haven't been successful.  I've included a screenshot, showing my display settings.  If anyone can help, I'd greatly appreciate it!

		Try pushing the 'Default' button in the 'Overlay Mode' box <br />

		Hi JonnyMac,<br />
<br />
  Thanks for responding.  So I disabled nView settings for Winamp and it doesn't seem to have any affect.  I'll be posting my problem into the new topic, thanks, and hopefully you'll see through out this problem.<br />

		Oh, seeing that my post was moved automatically, here are my computer specs.  <br />
<br />
Clevo Laptop model D900<br />
3.6 Ghz Intel CPU on a 915G intel chipset Motherboard<br />
2 Gig Ram<br />
120 Gigs (60x2) Harddrive space<br />
250 Gigs of additional Harddrive space from a Plug and Play drive<br />
256 meg Nvidia 6800go video card<br />
Intel intergreated Realtek AC 880 HD Audio codecs<br />
Windows XP SP2<br />
<br />
My Computer is equipped with the latest drivers.  I have tried disabling default wallpaper, active desktop and also disabling nView settings for Winamp.  The last thing I want to do is reformat my PC since this will drive me crazy!  So if anyone could get back to me I'd appreciate it!  Thanks<br />
<br />

		As JonnyMac said, try pushing the default button. If that doesn't do anything, change the color to 31,0,15 (R,G,B), this should be the default color. Other than that, I'm not too sure what the problem might be. Just make sure you have latest version of AVS.<br />
<br />
It's smaller and may be hard to see, but you can see that it works here (you won't it actually running on the desktop, you can't take screenshots of it moving). Perhaps you can see something that we've both missed. Anyway, good luck! :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and be sure to download some new presets! The default selection is rather limited. ;)

		Gah, no luck.  I've checked, and triple checked.  Everything is up to date.  I've tried Milkdrop and it has a feature built right in that i can make it go to desktop but explorer crashes and hides all my icons.  I know that on my old laptop (which was severely underpowered compared to the one i have now) ran it alright with an older version of Winamp.  So I'm just going to reformat.  Hopefully I can isolate the problem first before I do.  So if anyone has any other comments i'm all open to suggestions.

		Check if fullscreen overlay -mode is working with avs.<br />
<br />
If not, check if fullscreen video is working after all (on your primary monitor).<br />
You might have set this to your secondary one once, so avs overlay will be reditrected and not shown where you expect it.

		What color setting is your desktop set to? 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit? That shouldn't make a difference, but it might.<br />
<br />
With the &quot;Overlay mode&quot; enabled, &quot;Set desktop to color&quot; should set the desktop to a solid color (the overlay color you can choose) regardless of whether or not you have a wallpaper selected. This is how it works on all of my computers. Judging from your screenshot, though, this is what's not happening. Regardless of whether that's turned on or not, though, you should at least see some motion within the little &quot;Color&quot; box. If that doesn't happen either, you may need to select a different color. (And also confirm that your video card supports overlay mode; considering it's nVidia, though, it's highly unlikely that this is the problem.)<br />
<br />
I don't know if AVS checks this setting or not, but you can also look in the &quot;Video&quot; category in your WinAmp preferences, and make sure &quot;Allow hardware video overlay&quot; is enabled. (While you're at it, you can try playing a video file in WinAmp to make sure that part is working correctly. You can tell you're using overlay mode if you take a screenshot and see a blank rectangle where the video is.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.
