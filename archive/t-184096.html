			<strong>rotation problem</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		see attached file.<br />
<br />
The ball should rotate forward, but seems to tilt only over 90 degrees or so...<br />
<br />
I've tried about everything, but as far as I can see, tx increases with .05 per frame and sx is just sin(tx) and cx is no more than cos(tx). :igor: so I don't exactly get it..<br />
<br />
A bit of help would be appreciated.

		Are you sure you're not just forgetting to hide the highlight when it's at the back of the ball?<br />
<br />
Btw, aspect ratio correction. Use it.

		I's not about the colors, it's about the entire rotation of the ball. These colors are just for testing and to follow the top of the ball (where i is near to 1). <br />
<br />
[edit] oops.. you're right. moving the ball down (smy) made it look like it did only rotate over 90 degrees. Restoring that made me see my mistake... thanks[/edit]<br />
<br />
About the aspect ratio: the track itself isn't near to completion yet; I probably won't even be using this. The ball itself does use the correct aspect ratio (reg07+08).
