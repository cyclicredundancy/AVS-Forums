<div class="posttext">After a year of playing with presets, finally I have a few decent presets to release, mostly original, all tweaked, better have a fast pc, some run at 8 fps. Hope you like always nice to have more to add to the pile:winamp:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">these are not too original- all the effects have been done in some way or another.  they are not very pleasing to look at either.  look at the FAQ to learn 3d SSCs at DMs</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">dont take bad reviews to heart, these arent bad for noob presets, weve all made presets like this, dont get discouraged. Its just that people on here have seen this type of preset very often. Dont give up, look at the avs primer and the faq and things like that and you'll get better. These are too grainy and noob like but just keep making and learning about avs and dont give up because of the bad reviews. Its all part of the process ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here is my review of your presets.<br />
<br />
DotDereTankyou_5th_elementrmx : It just doesn't look that nice.<br />
<br />
Fairies_overtime : Looks nice but not very music responsive.<br />
<br />
give us your money! : It is only beat responsive and is quite ugly.<br />
<br />
kagakaa{RMX} : Not music responsive.<br />
<br />
Madefromscratch : Slightly music responsive but ugly.<br />
<br />
Multi_dimensional_crack : Not very music responsive but OK.<br />
<br />
OsostarX2 : Just a blur not very nice.<br />
<br />
Phucking : Not music responsive from what I can see and not very nice.<br />
<br />
Sauron's eye 2 : Very simple and not that music responsive but slightly.<br />
<br />
Sentences2 : Not bad but I don't know anyone who likes a preset that keeps flashing the words &quot;I am your god&quot; in your face.<br />
<br />
SmokeStarDust{PastelRMX} : Not music responsive and just doesn't look good.<br />
<br />
SmokeStarDusttwistedroto : Same as above with a bit of beat responsiveness.<br />
<br />
The_Constantinople_Cantelope : OK but I have seen better.<br />
<br />
The_Fuzzies(RMX2) : Could be more music responsive but not bad.<br />
<br />
TheSmogKingFinal : Not music responsive (Hint: Don't use movements and waters at the same time without effect lists)<br />
<br />
Sorry if this review is too harsh. You should read Atero's AVS Primer it would help you make better presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not suprised really at getting the hashing, most of what I've done is tweak with other formulas to get a feel for the math and for personal pleasure, I have others that are more rebuilds and tweaks of some of the major packs but I didn't want offer rehashed versions of what everyone else already has, inadvertantly I guess I did. I'm still working on building my own formulas for dynamic distance modifiers and dynamic movements, I'll go look at Atero's Primer and any other good explanations of the programming behind the math and hopefully these will improve, <br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">First: Welcome at the forum.<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
Don't start thinking we're all rude people doing nothing else than giving real bad reviews, just to scare you away, the idea is to help you learn how to use AVS properly. It doesn't mean we don't like you as an artist, it just means you have a lot of things to learn.<br />
<br />
Hint: Download as many packs as you can find and tear their codes apart to learn what it means. It may seem scary at first, but once you get a bit of a hold of coding, you learn faster every day.<br />
<br />
For the 5th element RMX, try removing that Simple and enable 'blend' in the final mov. that makes it a bit watchable...<br />
Kagakaa looks best, although two set render modes above each other doesn't do anything, only the one at the bottom is used.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">semaj: it is a tradition here, everyone new gets lot of scolding</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, everyone who makes presets that still need some work gets scolded.  He's better than many of the n00bs though, so he isn't getting scolded too badly - and he didn't ask any stupid questions either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th March 2003, 19:07</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hes not getting scolded, hes getting welcomed. Everyones presets could use improvement except that select few, like UnConeD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">of topic..<br />
hm...advertizement pays..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th March 2003, 10:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Also it seems that the forum regulars pay more attention towards n00bs than them selfs/better artist's :D<br />
So don't get cocky if you get a lot of replies to your first pack :blah:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th March 2003, 02:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah well, regulars arent going anywhere, we need noobs to get better, more presets to stare at for us, more attention on avs, better for avs, better for regulars.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hello Everyone,<br />
<br />
I can see by the number of replies that this is a pretty friendly board, and willing to set the bar high enough to remind most to take what they do seriously, no matter what it is. Why not give a little ribbing to test people's ability to live on a planet with 6 billion people on it, right? But, to stay on topic, some of you hit it on the nose, and I admit I've got to learn before I can produce really professional presets. My math skills end at a little advanced algebra, and to be honest, most of my familiarity with the functions comes from good ol’ fractint, and what reading I’ve done on Mandelbrot and fractal theory. So the concept behind 3d movement on a 2d surface is not entirely foreign. The hardcore, work the equation out in your head (and how many of us can do that?), mind bending challenge calculus and trig can be to the uninitiated, admittedly frightens off a lot of people. I have started reading up on other threads, also some university sites, all this extra net time inspired by the new cable connection, of course. What I have noticed though, in a lot of presets that I’ve downloaded, some 1000, is that sometimes, in the chase for the perfect equation, the visual experience suffers. Use it for what it's for, making your eyes water.. This really is a great tool for exploring 3d design, technical enough to belong on a computer, and fun to let run off in a corner if your having a party in your house. Now that I can fine tune some of the ideas I was working with, I can put together version 2 (be afraid)....<br />
Have Fun everybody..<br />
