<div class="posttext">Hey all. I've played this game on a lot of forums, and just felt like opening it here as well. Target of the game is to make a sentence as long as possible, without screwing up the grammar. The good part of it is that nobody can tell where the story will go. Rules are as follows:<br />
<br />
- Everyone is allowed to add only one word to this topic.<br />
- Placing a dot . is also allowed. This means that the sentence is closed and a new one can begin. <br />
- Giving a summary of the whole sentence is allowed.<br />
- You may add a word only once. Then you have to wait till another person adds a word to the sentence before you may add one again.<br />
- If topic is dead for two full days, it is allowed to add a word again if the last word before that was made by you as well.<br />
- The one who screws up the entire sentence is an ass-raper.<br />
<br />
Hope you all participate. Enjoy! :D<br />

<div class="posttext">this is fun, but not at all related to avs. we used to play word builder. the first person says an alphabet, then the second person says another one and so on. when i word is formed, then the last person is out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I started the game at the general forum. Too bad some horned up guys created some disgusting sentences and therefor the topic is closed :(. I already was afraid of that to happen over there. Here only people come who are interested in AVS, not every sick dude on this planet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">But we use different ways to postpump than some forum games ;)<br />
<br />
Besides i don't think it quite fits here even if it would be something like &quot;AVS word game&quot; :igor:<br />
That is for General bullshit forums and i think it should stay there.</div></div><hr />
