		switch from lines to points and make sure you have a texture selected (I assume you are referring to the Texer)<br />
<br />
<br />
and PLEASE use the edit button

		You can't do stuff like x=d OnBeat - That's for Pixel section. For Frame, Init, and onBeat, the values are equal to every pixel/section of the screen.<br />
The alternative is if(b,n1,n2) for such thing.<br />
<br />
Texer works with any pixel you have on the screen.<br />
<br />

		What texer does is scan the image for non-black pixels and draw the texture bitmap around that point, optionally masked by the pixel's colour.<br />
<br />
The clearest example is my Milkyway II preset (which you'll probably have if you have texer). If you remove the 2 texers, you just get a bunch of dots.<br />
<br />
You could actually compare it to the convolution filter, except a bitmap is used for the convolution kernel, and the radius is unlimited :).

		Yeah, it's really weird how Texer does that. I could be able to do trails or something if that weren't the case. Otherwise it's a smashing APE. :)

		argh.  the reason it's showing a white bar at the top of the screen is because you're trying to texer too much.  use clear every frame or an effect list to fix that.<br />
as for trails... ^^^<br />
<br />
am i the only one that finds that painfully obvious?

		way to pay attention, unripelemon.<br />
There's been talk about the forums being down going on EVERYWHERE on winamp, in GD, in the AVS forums, on the chatrooms - fucking everywhere.  Most importantly, however:<br />
<b>&quot;THE FORUMS WERE DOWN, WE SUCK.&quot; &lt;- Front page of winamp.com</b><br />
<br />
thank you and goodnight

		The reason the white bar appears at the top if you use Texer is because you are trying to re-texer a texered image.<br />
Try moving everything in your preset in an effect list, and move the texer outside.

		This thread is on the very edge of flaming and needs to die. Now. I'm only posting because it's at the top of the page so people, please stop posting now and let it die. And please no unoriginal, attempts at pathetic humour with a post saying &quot;ok&quot;.
