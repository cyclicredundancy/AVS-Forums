      <p class="post-content">switch from lines to points and make sure you have a texture selected (I assume you are referring to the Texer)<br />

      <p class="post-content">You can't do stuff like x=d OnBeat - That's for Pixel section. For Frame, Init, and onBeat, the values are equal to every pixel/section of the screen.<br />
      The alternative is if(b,n1,n2) for such thing.<br />
      <br />
      Texer works with any pixel you have on the screen.<br />

      <p class="post-content">What texer does is scan the image for non-black pixels and draw the texture bitmap around that point, optionally masked by the pixel's colour.<br />
      <br />
      The clearest example is my Milkyway II preset (which you'll probably have if you have texer). If you remove the 2 texers, you just get a bunch of dots.<br />
      <br />
      You could actually compare it to the convolution filter, except a bitmap is used for the convolution kernel, and the radius is unlimited :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">argh. the reason it's showing a white bar at the top of the screen is because you're trying to texer too much. use clear every frame or an effect list to fix that.<br />
      as for trails... ^^^<br />
      <br />
      am i the only one that finds that painfully obvious?</p>

      There's been talk about the forums being down going on EVERYWHERE on winamp, in GD, in the AVS forums, on the chatrooms - fucking everywhere. Most importantly, however:<br />

      <p class="post-content">The reason the white bar appears at the top if you use Texer is because you are trying to re-texer a texered image.<br />
      Try moving everything in your preset in an effect list, and move the texer outside.</p>
