<div class="posttext">ive made another avs preset its still a &quot;prototype&quot; though. what i need to do is find a dynamic movement equation (in rect. coords.) to make it rotate, so , if anyone can do this, i appreciate you post the eq. here. also, if anyone can make any improvements, please do. and, oh ya, dont forget to critisise (just dont be to mean :))<br />
<br />
long live :winamp: !</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">bleh, a ring scope and a pointless DM, An ignore ignore efect list does nothing, even if it did do something you cleared the screen before it anyway, a black clear screen is pointless unless you change the blend option, plus it's disabled anyway, go over your damned presets, learn what you're doing before you randomly add things, the DM could be replaed by non rectangular coordinates frame:&quot;a=0.95&quot; beat:&quot;a=0.85&quot; pixel:&quot;d=d*a&quot;, rotation is simple &quot;r=r+speed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now let me put it in simple terms so you can understand it.<br />
Many things already been explained<br />
Big easy search function<br />
FAQ<br />
Tips and tricks threads<br />
Almost everything has been covered at some point<br />
Now go search and learn before midlessly asking questions.</div></div><hr />

If you want, you could put that as your signature.<br />
<br />
And I can't even download this file.  It's probably not you, it's most likely my stupid, virus embedded, cheap, uncooperative, lower than dirt, more-annoying-than-a-mosquito-in-your-ear, piece of crap internet connection.  So I'll try later.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Noob preset. :p<br />
<br />
Let me guess, first try. That's cool. We all started simple. There lots of resouces around this forum. Take a stroll throu the FAQ and the tips a nd tricks pages. If you get lost, ask someone, but nobody here's gonna make the preset for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dont see anything special in it.<br />
But since these are your first - Good going!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Simple rotation for scopes in Rectangular coords:<br />
<br />
<br />
x1=Put your normal x code here;<br />
y1=Put your normal y code here;<br />
<br />
x=x1*sin(rt)+y1*cos(rt);<br />
y=x1*cos(rt)-y1*sin(rt);<br />
<br />
<br />
rt is to be put in Per Frame, with wathever you want: A slow counting number, or a random on beat etc. (maybe a getosc?)<br />
<br />
Simple Rotation for Dynamic Movement (Rotoblitter effect, works better in normal movement):<br />
<br />
<br />
x=x+y*0.1; <br />
y=y-x*0.1;<br />
<br />
<br />
Try searching the forums for a change, The SSC code was in the Tips and Tricks 2 - Beginner and intermediate only thread, the DM code was in the Tips and Tricks thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">YOU FUCKING STUPID IDIOT! DON'T RIP OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK!<br />
<br />
The Dynamic movement inside the effect list (which apparently does nothing) is from my &quot;Worm-o-rama&quot; preset and that Dynamic Movement outside the effect list is from my &quot;Chrome Capsule&quot; preset. The dm's are simple, so anyone more advanced can easily make them themselves, but since you're stupid enough to put a ignore/ignore effect list into the preset i have every reason to believe that you ripped me off. Also the codes are exactly the same looking. Learn some fucking copyright rules and DO YOUR OWN SHIT asshole.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well ge, excuse me if i try to learn from your code! i was gonna post a comment in the code...apperantly noone understands that it is not completed yet.i used to look up to you as an idol, tugummi, i wanted to be just like you, i downloaded tons of your presets...now, those dreams are crushed. thanks alot.<br />
<br />
P.S - you might wanna fix your caps lock key...i think its broken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th June 2003, 16:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">GOD I HATE RIPPERS!:mad:<br />
I totally agree with tug, and if you wanted to learn something you could have experimented something and changed it instead to posted it as a whole.<br />
<br />
P.s. and one more thing everybody here agrees that rippers are ASS HOLES!:mad:<br />
 and one more thing why dont you try and respect your idols work and his work put on to make that DM?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Rocky, id like to thank you for telling me what Tuggummi said in much nicer manner, and with no caps :).I am fine when people tell me of my mistakes in a nice manner, it just gets really annyoying when someone goes off like i killed his family...i will try to modify the code more next time. heres my order in which i make avs for those who are confused:<br />
1.get an idea<br />
2.browse the forums for help<br />
2.create the base code<br />
3.copy the base code into an ignore/ignore effect list for later refrence<br />
4.create a short intro comment<br />
5. add extra effects to base code<br />
6.debug and enhanche<br />
7.add credits</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You shouldn't have even posted a preset that doesn't use only your code unless you give all credit for it to the author of that code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">read my last post: im havnt quite gotten to step 7 yet...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay it worked ths time..... yeah..... you ripped Tug pretty good.....<br />
<br />
you have a unenabled clear screen that doesn't need to be there.....<br />
<br />
also 2 sscs which are in the same spot.  It would be the exact same image if you took one out.<br />
<br />
btw - if you want to see a hellish preset check out Elvis' &quot;Hellfire&quot; and &quot;Gate to Hell&quot; presets.  Maybe you'll get a good inspiration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well excuse me for being a fucking human being. Just because blaa blaa make good presets blaa blaa idol blaa blaa, doesn't mean that i won't hate the fact when somebody just plain rips my work without any own effort, you've should atleast try to edit it or something, but nooooooooo you just ripped it straight off. :mad:<br />
<br />
Im so sorry to have feelings.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's what i said before,he did'nt even experimented or edited tug's code.<br />
Tug - i think it's quite normal .if i were you i would react in the same manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th June 2003, 08:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ishan, well i can blame myself too, normal persons control their temper, but im not like that... But what i really don't like is that i should be behaving nicely, just because a lot of people have downloaded and hopefully liked my work... that can be almost counted as some sort of racism :hang:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th June 2003, 08:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Tug , you see its just that we are seeing so many rippers these days it very...annoying, and besides these rippers are new to AVS so that dont realise how much effort had been put to make it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well im chill now, i don't actually care that much if my work is used, because it's so simple. I just want you to know that when you use other peoples work you should:<br />
<br />
1) credit the author<br />
2) Try to learn from it &amp; try to edit it yourself<br />
<br />
I'll shut my mouth now.</div></div><hr />
