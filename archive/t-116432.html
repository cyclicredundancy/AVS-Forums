<div class="posttext">bleh, they fucked up AGAIN. and look at the rating, the pack deserves more than that.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">It seems the AOL partnership has finally caught up with them...<br />

This is the second incident of what I call 'Dubya' syndrome. The review panel seriously need reviewing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I updated Whacko AVS VI to include the font-info and noticed the same had happened: it had suddenly become Whacko AVS V, with exactly the same comments from me and the reviewer.<br />
<br />
The visitor reviews had stayed correct though.<br />
<br />
Now I just hope they notice that the current review is incorrect, so it doesn't talk about presets that aren't in there :P.</div></div><hr />

Parle francois?<br />
<br />
Its 'Parlez-vous Francais?' surely.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yes this sucks dog testicles it needs to be fixed, perhaps if we bought some beer (http://www.bevmo.com) for the nullsoft boys it would help</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually if you want to nitpick, it's français :) (aren't international keyboards fun?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th December 2002, 02:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Don't lie UnConeD, you used charmap.exe, as if you'd have an international keyboard :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well it's a friggin complicated language and i don't have any translators for french :D<br />
<br />
But i doubt it will be changed anytime soon since &quot;WDM 3D Space&quot; with the wrong screenshot is still up there (if that is even related into this one)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if the database is corrupted it will take more than just a day to fix it, because i doubt they will fix the info of one component. They will probably fix the whole database at once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">F'ing database<br />
<br />
actually got in wrote a new review but then it didn't save and has now locked me out.<br />
<br />
Noted on the to do list with zens pack.<br />
<br />
Oh if someone can find out what they want in their own comment drop it in his thread and I will update that too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">BTW just to make the whole of winamp.com consistant the review will read:<br />
<br />
This is AVS pack !!!!<br />
<br />
This is AVS pack not French translation !!!!!!!?????? Reviewer is SLEEP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Rovastar: hehe actually this was the first time I had realized Mohammad Ali Whathisname was NOT a bot :) and had typed his own review.<br />
<br />
Tuggummi: the WdM mistake was caused by the Winamp staff who created the wrong image for the pack. As far as I know, all the 'featured' images are made by hand, so it's a human error.<br />
<br />
Oh and actually I didn't use charmap... one of Belgium's languages is french, so I have keys for: éèçàù and I have combo-keys (put an accent on any letter by typing the combo-key followed by the letter) for ~´`¨^. The only ones I can't do are scandinavian and slavic (and any non-latin alphabet of course).</div></div><hr />
