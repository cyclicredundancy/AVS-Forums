      <br />
      The visitor reviews had stayed correct though.<br />
      <br />
      Now I just hope they notice that the current review is incorrect, so it doesn't talk about presets that aren't in there :P.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well it's a friggin complicated language and i don't have any translators for french :D<br />
      <br />
      But i doubt it will be changed anytime soon since "WDM 3D Space" with the wrong screenshot is still up there (if that is even related into this one)<br />
      <br />
      Nevertheless, if the database is corrupted it will take more than just a day to fix it, because i doubt they will fix the info of one component. They will probably fix the whole database at once.</p>

      <br />
      Tuggummi: the WdM mistake was caused by the Winamp staff who created the wrong image for the pack. As far as I know, all the 'featured' images are made by hand, so it's a human error.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and actually I didn't use charmap... one of Belgium's languages is french, so I have keys for: √©√®√ß√†√π and I have combo-keys (put an accent on any letter by typing the combo-key followed by the letter) for ~¬¥`¬®^. The only ones I can't do are scandinavian and slavic (and any non-latin alphabet of course).<br /></p>
