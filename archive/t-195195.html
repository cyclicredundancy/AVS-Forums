<div class="posttext">is there anyway i could load 2pictures into a avs file, when it's quiet it shows one of the pictures and on beat it changes to the other one and then back. I also want to know if it is possible to move the picture around? (to the left, right, up, down etc. etc.)<br />
Sorry for the crapy english!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a avs preset that does just that. You have to choose the pictures to be used yourself though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">maybe, but i truly doubt that i will do that advanced stuff ;) I wonder also if there is anyway to set the onbeat level higher? So it not react so easy on speech and so on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, no way to adjust he beat detection. Im afraid that's just AVS's own beatdetection's fault, doing it the hard way is quite advanced indeed ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if i'm wrong, but wouldn't you just do this:<br />
<br />
<br />
  picture<br />
  effectslist (output&gt;replace) (enabled onbeat)<br />
       effectslist (output&gt;replace) use override and have enabled=getosc/getspec and have your other picture in here?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yea you can code your own beat detection into an effect list (or with a global ssc that dumps to registers for tidyness) but given that you don't want to get into &quot;advanced stuff&quot; (*chuckle*) you might not want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">use what i said having your first picture then an effectlist enabled on beat and another effectlist inside that with override enabled and type in the big box &quot;enabled=getspec(0.01,1,0)&quot;(needs some tuning, im not that good with getspec)and put your second picture in that. Like this:</div></div><hr />

# Picture II<br />
Improved picture renderer. Can read BMP and JPEG, supports all AVS blend modes, subdirectories and bilinear filtering.<br />
# AVSGrabber - 2.0 alpha<br />
Note: AVSGrabber is unsupported. Don't ask me for help if you can't figure it out or if it crashes.<br />
Captures AVS presets to AVI. Insert into the preset to use it. For experimental audio capturing, use the provided out_grab.dll as output in Winamp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just one additional question related to previous post.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded picture renderer from Steven Wittens site but I have no clue how to use it/open it. Is it an application that enables you to insert bitmap images or not? Can someone please explain how to insert pics or at least post a link to existing forum topic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Place it in your winamp/plugins/avs folder<br />
In editor you should be able to add it to your preset from [+]-&gt;Render-&gt;Picture II<br />
<br />
If you want to add an image to your avs, place the bitmap in your winamp/plugins/avs folder too, then from which ever image loader you're going to use, you should be able to select it from the list of images.<br />
Picture, Picture II and Texer II all load images.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best way to learn is to find some preset that use images and pick them apart to see how they tick.</div></div><hr />
