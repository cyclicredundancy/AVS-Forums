      <p class="post-content"><strong>Picture</strong><br />
      is there anyway i could load 2pictures into a avs file, when it's quiet it shows one of the pictures and on beat it changes to the other one and then back. I also want to know if it is possible to move the picture around? (to the left, right, up, down etc. etc.)<br />
      Sorry for the crapy english!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a avs preset that does just that. You have to choose the pictures to be used yourself though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea you can code your own beat detection into an effect list (or with a global ssc that dumps to registers for tidyness) but given that you don't want to get into "advanced stuff" (*chuckle*) you might not want to.</p>

      <p class="post-content">use what i said having your first picture then an effectlist enabled on beat and another effectlist inside that with override enabled and type in the big box "enabled=getspec(0.01,1,0)"<font size="1">(needs some tuning, im not that good with getspec)</font>and put your second picture in that.

      <p class="post-content">Just one additional question related to previous post.<br />
      <br />
      I've downloaded picture renderer from Steven Wittens site but I have no clue how to use it/open it. Is it an application that enables you to insert bitmap images or not? Can someone please explain how to insert pics or at least post a link to existing forum topic.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Place it in your winamp/plugins/avs folder<br />
      In editor you should be able to add it to your preset from [+]-&gt;Render-&gt;Picture II<br />
      <br />
      If you want to add an image to your avs, place the bitmap in your winamp/plugins/avs folder too, then from which ever image loader you're going to use, you should be able to select it from the list of images.<br />
      Picture, Picture II and Texer II all load images.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Best way to learn is to find some preset that use images and pick them apart to see how they tick.</p>
