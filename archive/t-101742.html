		Dunno the answer, but I do know it was answered before. Take a look around and check the tech support forum.

		You can't.  Winamp only sends AVS data from files on the hard drive...I don't know exactly how this work, but basically you cannot use AVS with a CD.  Same with most visuals, I think (including vis' other than Winamp's).<br />
<br />
Besides, who wants to listen to CDs in their computer...Go MP3 go! ;)

A quick search of the forums (without even having to use the engine), or reading the FAQ would answer this question immediately - and about 40 times at that.  I think you can figure it out from here... ;)

		Yeah, question like this are annoying not only 'cause the asked so frequently, but also because teaching somebody to code ain't easy. The best way is to look around and pick stuff up. There have been lots of questions answered about coding. If you get stuck, then ask about it and we'll see what we can do.<br />
<br />
Read the AVS FAQ sticky thread at the top of the forum.<br />
