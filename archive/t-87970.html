			<strong>The pack is almost ready...</strong><br />
		
		

		My first AVS pack, previewed a while back, is almost ready for release! Look out for uNDefineD 1 - Explosion in a week or so's time.<br />
<br />
If you want to dig up the preview, then by all means do so. :) It's called &quot;Working on my first pack&quot;, I think.<br />
<br />
Questions are welcome. :)

		I dug up the old thread (a link would have been nice:p ), they look pretty good, nice effects and a high framerate.

		I'd actually like to see the preset you use my hypercube in a bit before hand, since my work DID go into it...;) Could you e-mail it to me? <a href="mailto:therealatero@hotmail.com">therealatero@hotmail.com</a><br />
<br />
When you're done, could you post it here?  The search engine at the site suxxors, I can't find any of my first 3 packs (even though they suck - those were back in the days when I was a n00b) through it.

		You got it, Atero. I was intending to post the pack here anyway, because of the wait time. I had to wait about 5 weeks until my first skin got published, and just recently I had to update it, so there's ANOTHER few weeks down the drain. Maybe this is a good time to upload my Winamp website. :)
