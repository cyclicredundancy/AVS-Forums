		lol- why wiccans suck... lol :p  <br />
ya know something I was brought up druid, so I know how you feel... so many people of buy a phricken book and walk around saying stupid sh!t. <br />
<br />
Anywho- as for your pack- <br />
Great Start, I really liked &quot;did someone say trip&quot;, great use of a dumb superscope:up: <br />
<br />
A few of your preset would have been better with some more movement, seems like a lot of them are D=atan(d)- or a tunnel effect. On your next pack try puting things in a more fluid order, like on &quot;dont go into the light&quot; if you break it down it runs faster.<br />
<br />
BUT- I'm not a pro, so take it at whatever level you'd like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blessed Be

Hey, thanks for the great input. and i really should have updated those presets, most were done before new version of winamp:) I've been working on them lately so i should have a new pack out soon.
