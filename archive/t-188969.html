<div class="posttext">Hi. I would like to use AVS at a party soon but the problem is that there is no proper multi monitor support like there is in Geiss stuff. It would be great if I could change config, presets, messages etc without interupting the display. <br />
<br />
However, I see that an overlay can be applied to the desktop but this only happens on one monitor (the primary one). Why won't if display on both like a walpaper does instead of just going black? Is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Dom.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you use overlay it will only ever appear on one monitor, but you can set the overlay device in your graphics card config to be either monitor. If you have a tv-out on your graphics card you can plug in a tv and set that as the device.<br />
<br />
The alternative if you want to have AVS on one screen and winamp on the other is to just pixel double your AVS window and drag it to fill the screen (then have the config window and Winamp on your other screen).<br />
<br />
If you want it to show on 2 screens set the display mode to clone, but I dont think thats what you want.<br />
<br />
AVS multi-monitor support is non existant, gotta just make the most of it. :(</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I think thats what I need. However, does that mean my main desktop (start button, system tray etc) will still be on my primary monitor? <br />
<br />
I am not a home at the moment but I will try that when I get home. Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any other tips?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">To be honest getting multiple monitor displays just how you want them is really a matter of fiddling until it looks right. If your taskbar is on the wrong screen just drag it onto the other one (you can uncheck 'lock the taskbar' from the right click context menu). <br />
<br />
Like I said, best just to fiddle until you get it right. The only other tip i'd say is use a TV if at all possible, they're typically bigger, and because they are interlaced you can use lower resolutions and it still looks ok (dont forget the resolution of your avs window is scaled to fit the screen in overlay mode)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, good luck with the par-tay :up:</div></div><hr />
