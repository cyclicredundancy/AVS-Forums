			<strong>Webcam visualisation</strong><br />
		
		

		Are there any visualisation plug-ins that utilise the input from a webcam? seen this done at a few raves recently with shots of dancers. Thought it would be cool for parties using a webcam.

		This forum is specifically for AVS, which doesn't support webcam video.  I don't know of any off the top of my head, but I am sure that there are plenty.<br />

I don't think any of the winamp visualization programs support webcam video, but I may be wrong.

		Yes he is, but I don't blame him.  The other visualizations forum doesn't have any unique regulars in it.  Nobody looks at it.

		That is a possibility, but there are very few places where someone could go with a question like this - this is, IMO, one of those places.<br />
<br />
I tried running a google search, but couldn't find anything quickly that would do this - maybe you will have more luck.<br />

Raz, when did you get the new avatar?

hmm, &quot;<b>Winamp 2 Plugins</b>&quot;, wonder what that's all about.<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=124" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=124</a><br />
seems to me if there's one for wa2 there's probably one for 3 as well.  if it isn't obvious a quick look around could tell you, or if you still can't find it you could post in the general winamp 3 discussion forum and someone will point you in the right direction.  (i'm pretty sure it's skins/scripting but you can't tell from looking at the forum because of all the skin threads.)

		There are APE's that'll take input from from a camera attached to your system, but not a feed off the net.

		Well it streams every video input device connected to your pc directly to avs. This could be a webcam, a TV-Card or any analog or digital Video-In source. I already had some fun using water and blittering on livestreams but actually my GC can only do in our out but not both at the same time. Ill go further into this as soon is i get new hardware coz this is kewl foor liveacting :D

If you want to get it from the net you'll have to get it somehow as a valid wmv stream (was it wmv???) its the same sort of inputstream the moviemaker works with. Maybe you can google around for a solution.<br />
<br />
Or go ahead and write a browser.ape ;)
