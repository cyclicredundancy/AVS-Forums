		hmmm...<br />
so on fullscreen AVS, it goes to monitor 1, and the winamp window is on monitor 2.<br />
<br />
why do you NEED AVS fullscreen on monitor two?  if you are doing a live performance, then you can switch your monitor cables, so the projector is monitor one and your screen is monitor two.

		thanks for making me feel welcome guys. Michaelthecat thanks for understanding me! but i cannot switch the cables, right after i use winamp avs i have to use powerpoint. <br />
<br />
powerpoint= program on monitor 1 and slideshows on monitor 2<br />
<br />
winamp    = program on monitor 1 but on full screen avs puts avs on monitor 1 and winamp program on monitor 2  <br />
<br />
also i noticed nobody gave me a exact answer! so is there not a sulution to my problem? why could winamp not make a program to fix this?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. srry for the improper grammar Atero, or maybe your brain isnt able to read my language....o and no offence dude...!...<br />

		AVS goes to your primary display in fullscren and overlay mode. You'll have to extend your desktop across both monitors and move anything you're working on to your secondary display.
