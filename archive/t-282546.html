      I submitted these presets a while back and after the "few days" (aka 5 months) I received an email that my mini pack didn't go though. I thought that I would post the pack on this forum and make it better.<br />
      <br />
      The theme is plasma, that is, a liquidoid texture that morphs to the music. I like the presets OK as they are, but the presets tend to be repetitive and I'd like to add some reactivity to them.<br />
      <br />
      As of now, these are the presets that will be in the pack:<br />
      - Exploding Digital Green<br />
      - Liquid Plasma<br />
      - Molten Wheel Plasma<br />
      - Primordial Protoplasma<br />
      - Radioactive Plant Plasma<br />
      - Volcanic Calligraphy<br />
      - and a few remixes<br />
      <br />
      Love one? :D, hate one? :hang:, have an idea that would be cool :cool: or an edit to a preset, why don't you post a comment?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks, Sindri</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I lika da plasma</strong><br />
      Your plasma presets were cool. I especially enjoyed the liqid plasma and the digital exploding green. In fact, I liked them so much I had to remix them. I even added a little convolution to one. I'm not sure of that filter's mechanics, but i seem to understand how to manipulate it. weird huh?<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, I hope everyone in avs land likes them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">funny, i usually say i liked this preset so much, there was no need to remix it. anyway, the mosaic preset isn't great (that old add-a-mosaic-and-call-it-digital thing). the second one is more interesting, but way too slow. you need to optimize the convolution (scaling should be 2^n).<br />
      <br />
      about the originals, i liked the first 2 best. try playing more with trans effects and please try something different than black backgrounds.</p>

      I'm currently working on remixes of the pack using Yaths suggestions to a degree of course so keep watch for my stuff.</p>
