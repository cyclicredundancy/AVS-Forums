<div class="posttext">Is there a way to configure the plug-in so that the input is from a program (game) audio?<br />
<br />
I want to set up a projector as a second &quot;monitor&quot; and have it aimed at the ceiling to have ambient lighting, while playing a game (Diablo 3, not that it matters).<br />
<br />
Any input would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not directly, no. You could use a minijack Y-cable or a mixer and return the audio to your line-in. Then, open the following URL in your playlist: linein://<br />
<br />
It's kind of messed up but the only way that I know of to get it done.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I see.<br />
<br />
I'll try to digital-out into the surround sound receiver and line back in the PC.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">there has to be a way to map the sound through software. maybe jasper's plugin (http://home.hccnet.nl/th.v.d.gronde/dev/index.html) is of any help?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:down: Jasper's plugin didn't work for me (I didn't try much, felt too complicated).<br />
<br />
:down: I also tried a program called &quot;virtual audio cable&quot; - but is shareware and had someone say &quot;shareware&quot; every 30 seconds (pretty annoying) - didn't buy it.<br />
<br />
:up: The minijack Y splitter, on the other hand, worked like a charm - but not after some adjustments.<br />
<br />
     1.    Before plugging any cables, make sure your stereo equipment is turned off since this setup can cause feedback, if not properly configured.<br />
<br />
     2.    Then, you HAVE to plug in the cables for the motherboard to detect it.  I was doing a 6 channel output setup (5.1 surround) so the minijack Y splitter was plugged in the &quot;front pair&quot; jack, and had a cable go to the line-in at rear panel.<br />
<br />
     3.    Once everything is plugged-in: In Windows 7, open the recording devices, select the &quot;line in at rear panel&quot;, properties, under the &quot;listen&quot; tab, check the box &quot;listen to this device&quot;.  Under the &quot;levels&quot; tab, bring that to around 80%. Click OK and close sound options.  Open the volume mixer and lower the &quot;Line in at rear panel&quot; level to 0%.<br />
<br />
     4.    It is now safe to turn on your stereo equipment.<br />
<br />
     5.    In Winamp :winamp:, open the following URL in your playlist: linein://<br />
<br />
Now, whatever plays through the front speakers will go back through the line-in and you will be able to enjoy visualisations with any audio streams...<br />
<br />
Needless to say, our Diablo 3 venue was a complete success. :)<br />
<br />
P.S. I wish i could post a picture of our setup, but it says that my 30kb .jpg is not a valid image file...?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah uploading files is sometimes buggy. Most of us use imageshack.us<br />
<br />
Great to hear it worked out. I still wish this could be done through software. After reading around a bit I suspect it could have something to do with preventing copyright infringement.</div></div><hr />
