			<strong>I NEED HELP -- boo hoo I lost my favorite preset</strong><br />
		
		

		For the last two years I have been using one, and only ONE, preset. It was my most favorite of all presets in the whole wide world. I would sit for hours at my computer and stare at it mezmorised and captivated.<br />
<br />
The preset was mig's NEGSTAR. But alas updated my WINAMP and now it's GONE.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me locate a copy of mig-NEGSTAR in the the preset downloads !!!!! ????<br />
<br />
My WINAMP and my LIFE are incomplete without it.<br />
<br />
I would be eternally grateful.

		Sure you search for NEGST <b>A</b> R?<br />
I found a preset called &quot;mig - spirostar-NEGST <b>E</b> R&quot; in my Presets-archives. (I was to lazy to search the Winamp-downloads). I hope it's the one you were longing for ;)

			<strong>That's IT !!!!!  Negster !!!!</strong><br />
		
		

		Happy, Happy.<br />
<br />
Thank you ever so much, kind soul, for helping me find my lost preset.<br />
<br />
It's the one I was looking for. Negster is the one preset by which I compare all other presets to -- it's my favorite brain candy.<br />
<br />
Once again, thank you.

		No offense to your tastes, but it sounds to me like you need to explore the world of AVS more. There are tons of better presets out there, in my opinion. :P
