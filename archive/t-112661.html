      <p class="post-content"><strong>Well...</strong><br />
      There are no programs I know of to assist in making AVSs.<br />
      Usually it is best to start simple w/ pre-made superscopes, the simple, ring, and pre-defined movements. If you look under "develop" on the tabs at the top of the page, it offers some help. Look at examples given in the AVS window (newpicks for Winamp 2.x, Nullsoft for 3.x), or download other presets. If you search through the forums, there are small guides to certain things (i.e. 3d superscopes)<br />
      <br />
      Good luck</p>

      <p class="post-content">All of the best AVS artists have learned for themselves for the most part. Once you figure out the basics for yourself then we'll be able to give you help and advice on specific things and share our tricks and cheats with you. You will have to figure out the basics for yourself though, they are to simple to really explain without feeling patronising.<br />
      <br />
      Also, a word of warning, posts like this really annoy some people around here... i.e. we don't all have tons of spare time available to teach someone how to make AVS presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, you got lucky this time, but fear it, for it will come. In the mean time, here's a stock post.<br />
