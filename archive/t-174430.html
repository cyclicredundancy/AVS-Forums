<div class="posttext">i just looked at radar imagery and noticed you used hundreds of &quot;Trans / Color Clip&quot;s try using &quot;Trans / Color Map&quot; instead. it should be included in winamp 5.02 (Full package)<br />
Color Maps is (i think) easier to use than 10 Color Clips :)<br />
<br />
and the images look blocky. you can fix this by using Picture II (by UnConeD) which supports bilinear filtering and is also included in the Winamp 5.02 Full package<br />
Picture II is also faster because it doesn't load the image every frame.<br />
<br />
but nice idea anyway i bet you can find your house on that map ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Around the wormhole: is that the DS9 wormhole? :)<br />
Corona: nice, like photos from SOHO :)<br />
Corrosion: hmm why do the lights have to jump around?<br />
Emerald: really cool, just a bit slow :(<br />
Im a Mechanical Man: The stars are not solid at higher resolutions (like 400x300) try setting the line size a bit higherwith either a Misc/Set Render Mode or the linesize variable in the SSC<br />
Infection: looks like bacteria cultures :) the beat reaction is a bit strange i think...<br />
Lsd Kisses: trippy :)<br />
Madman: funny :) try pre-rendering the text to buffers to get a higher framerate. this runs at 9 fps for me :/<br />
Moonbones: nice colors :)<br />
Orogeny: why Arbitrary BPM? it looks good without it and is more beat responsive<br />
People of the sun: so this is the place where they make gold ingots :)<br />
Psychadelic hurricane world: the name says it all. nice to look at but better not too long *g*<br />
Stars on their eyes: a bit too hasty i think :) looks better without the reverse BPM<br />
taurus: wow! nice 3d thing, whatever it is :D<br />
Terrainial: greeeen :)<br />
Train to Hell: nice but not much beat response :( try increasing speed a bit onBeat and slowing it down to normal like this:<br />
speed=(speed-normalspeed)*.9+normalspeed<br />
Antacid: great colors :)<br />
<br />
Don't count the smilies please :D :D :D<br />
<br />
my favorites are: emerald, taurus, madman, train to hell, Corona</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Is this your first pack? It's really good. My fav's are Emerald, Orogeny, People of the Sun, Radar Imagery is nice, Train to Hell is nicely done. Overall decent, stylish presets (most of them). Keep up the work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JesseJ</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th March 2004, 22:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes it's my first pack, I just decided to look for this forum yesterday.  I made radar imagery back when I had w3, I've been meaning to make a better cloud former, also that occationally clouds spawn off the ridges. I'll go and update stuff, cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Shock Value</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th March 2004, 22:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Very nice, especially since this is your first pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I've fixed the stars.<br />
<br />
What exactly does the Reverse BPM do?  The stars need a high beatrate or they'll just sit around the edges like.. tadpoles in a bowl, rarely going across the centre because theres a near 1/6 chance that a beat will lead it near the centre. Reverse and they rarely get to the side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th March 2004, 10:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Reverse BPM does exactly what it says :) It reverses the beats, so that when the beat is detected there isn't a beat and when there is no beat detected there is a beat (a bit stupid explanation, but nevermind...) Just think it like this: (b is beat, x is nobeat) normal: bxxxb -&gt; reversed: xbbbx<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the pack is good especially since it's your first, you managed to avoid some of the basic mistakes new avsters do like using water filter for &quot;tRIp OuT!!&quot; effects :p<br />
Still some of these are quite stacked with effects, &quot;less is more&quot; and &quot;framerate is god&quot; are some of the sayings around here ;) Of course you can't always go with speed, but if it is possible to optimize the presets it's definetly worth it.<br />
Well as for what my favorite ones go, they are: Emerald (although it's slow), Stars in their eyes (love the stars, but the background is quite frankly horrible :(), madman (hahaha, that's hilarious, the background could be better though) &amp; Train to Hell (i say, what a nice preset :up: )<br />
<br />
Good work for a 1st pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I was under the impression that everyone but me had computers that can handle loads of effects, lesson learned. In that case you won't like the new Radar Imagery. It's got a bunch more stuff forming the clouds, but it's also got a Colour map and Picture II. I didnt use bilinear filtering because thats not what the picture looked like, there goes the illusion. I've already blown some people away with my live feed from the weather service.<br />
Original at: metservice (http://www.metservice.co.nz/radar/index.asp) <br />
<br />
About Reverse BPM, there's a beat when the usually isn't? So if there's a 6 BPM input, what frequency are the beats in between? 18 BPM?<br />
<br />
The idea with Stars on their eyes was for a gleaming light in the middle with stars that move to cover it then it grows back, aparently water is as popular here as Comic Sans on b3ta. Want me to pile it up with effects then?<br />
<br />
PS Doesn't need radarframe.bmp anymore, I was just lazy. I got w5.02 today, it seems to run slower than 5.01, classic skin ofcourse. Am I imagining things?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">here's (another) explanation of reverse BPM:<br />
AVS scans the audio stream for beats.<br />
if it finds one, the next frame is a beat frame.<br />
reverse bpm makes all beat frames non-beat frames and make all non-beat frames beat frames<br />
<br />
an example:<br />
you have 120 bpm and 20 fps<br />
1 second contains 20 frames and 2 beats.<br />
this would look like this:<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
beat frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />

normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />
beat frame<br />
normal frame<br />
normal frame<br />

<br />
reverse bpm turns it into this:<br />

erm btw your .zip is empty (i use winzip 9.0)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When I Browse to find the zip file I've made it's not there but the file that ws there yesterday that I deleted is. It hasn't been updated and I tried restarting. Tried typing the correct path of the wanted file but that resulted in an empty file aparently. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th March 2004, 06:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well water ain't all that bad when used &quot;right&quot; (=in any other way than originally it was ment for) I mean there are just so many &quot;flow&quot; type of presets that wouldn't work at all without the water filter :)<br />
And you don't need to fill it with effects, just come up with something more... subtle (maybe a convo glow &amp; faint inward zoom or the likes?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Pixelcraft</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st March 2004, 00:06</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Aha, ya, very nice.  <br />
<br />
Man....haven't been here in a hella long time...I think I forgot how to do AVS (I'm serious) :confused: <br />
<br />
Anyways, you did good ;) :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">to solve the empty zip problem<br />
try delete the zip, and make a new zip<br />
if that didn't work, remove any strange characters from the name (meaning especially letters like áéíóúäöü)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JesseJ</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st March 2004, 04:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">trust me everything is in order, just it won't recognise any changes in the folders since monday.<br />
<br />
I'll try putting a file of same name as the one recognised but with radar in it.<br />
<br />
EDIt - that was interesting it's still there with original contects, although I've changed stuff in the folder view, it's not being changed in this alternate universe where I didn't actually delete that file on monday.  I'll go see what regedit has to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st March 2004, 12:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm you're using some kind of put-my-zip-files-into-the-folder-structure tool, right?<br />
try<br />
WinZip (http://www.winzip.com) or WinRAR (http://www.winrar.com)<br />
or, if these 2 didn't work, just rename the .avs to .zip (but write this in your post!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JesseJ</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st March 2004, 21:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">couldn't rename it as a zip properly.<br />
Anyway I found some bung looking entries in the winrar stuff so reinstalled it but that didnt work. No further correspondence until I get this fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st March 2004, 22:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i suspect you are using windows xp ;)<br />
and the zip-to-folder thingy that is provided with it, is this correct? :)<br />
try to deactivate it, this should help the rename-to-zip-problem<br />
or just rename it to gif jpg png txt rar bmp jpeg wsz wal m maki nsi nsh 7z xml :) best would probably be .txt</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ME, using WinRAR 3.something<br />
<br />
The same as used to make the pack. But after a week it's sorted itself out, that's windows for ya.<br />
<br />
I'm off my AVS binge now, work and go karting beckons. I may return someday, until then cheers for the feedback.</div></div><hr />

looks better and is faster. good work :)</div></div><hr />
