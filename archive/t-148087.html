		yes, here it is, my latest release<br />
it contains 5 presets, 2 new versions of old presetd, 1 remix of tuggummi's play blocks and 2 new presets<br />
<br />
moondust: this is a new version of event:horizon, from mono3(i think), i gave it a diffent flavour, some are gonna like this other won't<br />
<br />
starglow: this is a new version of way to io ffor it's going down, i was never satisfied with the version i created, so i stripped it down, added some new dm/alpha tricks and now i like it, the preset is a bit dark, but i like it that way<br />
<br />
rest (when you're dead): this is the remix of play blocks, you will recognize the original, but i added a bit more annd gave it a diffent touch<br />
<br />
thrill (my flow): this is a &quot;alpha tricks&quot; preset, basicly it's all about the alpha.<br />
<br />
cloudwalking: it's a yet another 3d-rotozoomer preset with a twist, <br />
hope you like it.<br />
<br />
one last thins, i made this on a fast computer and i got almost 32fps on all presets, so if any presets are slow on slower computers, i apoligize for that

		Nice.  Nothing amazing, but they are definitely good presets.

		A bit old looking style presets, but nice nevertheless.<br />
<br />
moondust: This is pretty cool, all the different smoke effects blend together nicely, but my problem here is the watery look which doesn't quite fit to a &quot;dusty&quot; theme.<br />
<br />
cloudwalking: Another rolling wallpattern thingy, just like you said. Tho the texture is nice for a change :up:<br />
<br />
Rest: so this is the remix, pretty fucked up as in: Can't really see the effect of the original :p But the dm is great still, nice warp effects.<br />
<br />
starglow: uhm... can't really see anything here... too dark.<br />
<br />
thrill: i like the swirly pattern, but can't say i like the dm that much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well as i said, they look a bit old, but you have been away a long time. I still believe you can do good stuff once you get up&amp;running again, but these aren't just yet your best work :)
