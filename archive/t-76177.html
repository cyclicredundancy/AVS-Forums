<br />
<div class="posttext">is it possible to detect, if a song has a slow or fast beat? so i can depending upon that determine that maybe a scope is blue or red.<br />
<br />
<br />
or is this a further point for the avs-wishlist?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, Winamp has a built-in beat detector.<br />
<br />
Here's how to access it:<br />
<br />
1.) Start the song you want to measure<br />
2.) Start Winamp AVS, then start Winamp AVS Editor<br />
3.) Go to Settings, then go to Beat Detection<br />
<br />
If you've never used the beat detection before, it may have to &quot;learn&quot; first.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that i know, but what i meant is, how i can say in the SS that if the song has a slow beat, the color is more blue and if the beat is fast, the color is red, as example</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'd say probably tinker around in On Beat to something like this:<br />
<br />
assuming that b=number of beats:<br />
<br />
If(above(b,.5), red=1, blue=1); <br />
<br />
That's just a guess though.  Try pm-ing unconed<br />
<br />
Or you could request that they add the option to assign the BPM to a variable as a new feature for AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, onbeat only gives a one or zero, not a speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i tested yesterday and found out, that it does not function, so i posted a request for a timecounter in the wishlist (look down), maybe something like this already exist, i don't know <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;a timecounter var in SuperScope and DynamicMovement, so SS or DM could detect if the song has a high or low bpm <br />
<br />
example: <br />
the var &quot;time&quot; would count the seconds <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
init:<br />
beat=0;time=0<br />
on Beat:<br />
beat=beat+1counts the beat <br />
<br />
per Poin: <br />
<br />
bpm=beat*60/time;calculates the bpm <br />
<br />
beat=if(equal(time,30),0,beat);<br />
time=if(equal(time,30),0,time)restes beat and time synchonously every 30 seconds, it also may reset all 15 seconds.. its only a question how exactly the bpm should be. <br />
<br />
pleas make possible <br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
i also tried it with counting the framerate, but that would need a stably framerate<br />
<br />
maybe UnConeD knows another solution<br />
i will ask</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">As far as I know, there's no way to get an actual time-readout. You can only get a relative time value, but its speed will depend on a user's computer. Given the fact that most people watch AVS at the resolution that offers them about 20-25fps, you can of course work out something that works most of the time.<br />
<br />
Another solution would be to make sure that you can reach a wide variety of colours/movements with different beat-speeds. That way, it will always yield an interesting result, regardless of cpu-speed. Of course it might not look the same everywhere, but that's neat too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think i found any relative solution to detect the speed of the sound... how said, it's relative... i think it also detects if music is activ.. looks fine, i think<br />
<br />
<br />
you can see if you're intrested</div></div><hr />
