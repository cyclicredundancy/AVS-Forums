<div class="posttext">I've been trying to make a 3d spectrogram with the dimentions frequency, time, and volume. It's base is a 25x25 grid. I know how to make it with 25 SuperScopes, but I want to learn how to make it with only one SuperScope, so I can learn more about megabufs.<br />
<br />
I've tried doing everything. I searched it on WA forums, Google, after I failed at making it myself. This is what I have so far though (please don't try to clean up the code. I'm not done with it yet)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay here is something I just knocked up for you, I'm sure it's not perfect but it does show (in my mind) how to achive what you wanted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">YES! Thats exactly what I want. Thank you. I spent 2 days trying to figure it out. I gotta learn about what you wrote. So what name should I put in the credit, QOALsoft or something else?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think PAK has done a tutorial somewhere about megabuf usage and maybe one for combining multiple superscopes into one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">:) I'm glad I could help you.<br />
<br />
To be honest it was a good mental work out since I hadn't done any thing with the megabuf for a while.<br />
<br />
If you really do feel like giving my credit go for QOAL or Quiche_on_a_leash</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are talking about the AVS Programing Guide, then I'v read that already. But if you're talking about a different megabuf tutorial, I'd like to hear about it, or even any other megabuf tutorial. Thanx in advanced.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In one of el-vis's old packs i believe it to be Hypnotised is a preset that features gmegabuf sound morphing. it a really impressive engine. it only does osc waves but it can be moded to do spectrum. also nice job on your first try.<br />
i'm trying to learn megabufs and stuff so i think i'll tinker around with your preset for awhile.</div></div><hr />
