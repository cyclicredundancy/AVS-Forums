      <p class="post-content"><strong>avs graber</strong><br />
      I tried the avs graber on my pc, it worked but it block after a few seconds. Is it a problem of power.<br />
      And in fast reaction presets, the precision is not good. Is it a problem of video card ?<br />
      Is here any codec to grab the avi files in a good quality and that would work with a not very powerfull pc, because I need to export the avi files to create a<br />
      dvd.</p>

      </blockquote>A good processor during the recording is a must here to increase the rendering speed (more FPS), especially if you want to put it on a DVD.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I strongly recommend you record it on another (faster) system if you're able to.<br />
      If that system doesn't have a DVD recorder, copy the .avi file to your own system and record the DVD there.

      </blockquote>The amount of time a codec spends encoding a video frame is in general directly proportional to its compression ratio. The fastest option is to use a really raw format then re-encode it afterwards.<br />
      <br />
      Video encoding is both memory and cpu intensive by default, even in a raw format, so it is likely you will still have some jerkyness/loss of responsiveness.<br />
      <br />
      With AVSgrabber, though, I have had more success with the MS MPEG-4 codec than any other (most others seem to crash for me after a couple of frames). Its reasonably fast, but since I don't have an especially slow system to test with I can't really speculate on how well it scales.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps
