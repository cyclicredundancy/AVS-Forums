      <p class="post-content"><strong>Problem with Convolution filter</strong><br />
      This one is really annoying, if I put certain numbers to convolution filter and try to refresh the preset (no matter how simple the preset is), Winamp just crashes. Why is this happening ?! Here, I attached a picture with those certain numbers (i'm pretty sure that there are more combinations like this)<br />
      <br />
      Btw.For some reason this Didn't happen with all of persons I asked....</p>

      <p class="post-content">Are you sure you have the latest version? If you are, try re-installing Winamp. It might also be a problem with WA3, if you're using it</p>

      <p class="post-content">Bias is. All it's doing is adding the value of every pixel surrounding the current pixel, multiplying them by their values on the 7x7 chart, then adding the bias, and then dividing it all by the scaling factor (which must be positive).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm pretty sure that I have the latest version of it. I allready reinstalled winamp since convofilter totally crashed my AVS ( even deleting avs_vis.dat didn't help) I tried only negative scaling but it didn't crash, and I noticed that it also crashes with some positive scaling numbers.<br />
      <br />
      Like I said before, those convonumbers didn't crash winamp from all the people I asked....</p>
