      <p class="post-content">The AVS reviewers are a bit slow in the head. I submitted my preset and they said I forgot to include the APE files, when they ARE included and DO get installed. :mad: :mad: :mad: All three people who commented (thanks) said the reviewer screwed up. Only problem is there is no 'Staff Problem' forum to post in, damnit.<br />
