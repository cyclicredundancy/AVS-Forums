      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need info for project...</strong><br />
      Hi everyone.<br />
      <br />
      I'm currently working on a project to help beginners understand the basic features, and uses of winamp AVS. This is just for fun, and once I complete it, I'll be posting it up on winamp and any other avs site that wants it.<br />
      <br />
      What I need is information. Be it a quick description of a cool use for a movement/superscope/other function, or an in depth tutorial. I will almost certainly use some part of ever submission. As well, people who send me information will get full credit for what they send me once the project is ready.<br />
      <br />
      I'm willing to add in people's tags, web-site links and other such matter. Just send me an email at <a href="mailto:transfrmr@hotmail.com">transfrmr@hotmail.com</a>.<br />
      <br />
      I really think this'll help a lot of people and I'm going to have 6 weeks off work to work on this stuff, so I think I can do a really good job.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not asking you to reveal your "special touches" or industry secrets :P, just to send in a quick demonstration of a function or combination of functions that you find interesting/usefull/a building block/etc.. If you can, please include a brief description of how this works, if you don't quite know, that's okay, I can still use it. I'm going to be learning more at the same time, so I'll probably be able to find a way to describe the functions myself, or post them up here or somewhere else to see what people think.<br />
      <br />
      sorry for the long winded speech, please help.. blah blah blah :)<br />
      <br />
      BTW. almost forgot, transformaplugs V2 is available here:<br />
      <a href="http://www.generation.net/~trnsfrmr/transformaplugsv2.exe" target="_blank">TRANSFORMAPLUGS V2</a><br />
      <br />
      and Transformaplugs V3 is available here:<br />
      <a href="http://www.generation.net/~trnsfrmr/transformaplugsv3.exe" target="_blank"><br />
      TRANSFORMAPLUGS V3</a><br />
      <br />
      They'll both be up on winamp itself soon.one thing though, The images you submit with your plugin. It says the small one should be 275x116 and the big one 275x464, is this right? because 275x116 is oddly distorted.. 175x116 looks much more reasonable...<br />
      <br />
      thanks ahead of time, and wish me luck,</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thanks..</strong><br />
      Actually, I saw what was going on over there, and i'd definitely like anyone to send me info from that project as well, but my idea's a little different. I think it would work better as an accompanyment to what they are working on there... I want to keep what it is exactly a secret for now so that I can surprise everyone :)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the comments on the packs, I like em.. although both V2 and V3 are nothing compared to V4, which is already nearing readyness for release...<br />
      <br />
      thanks again</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>You, or anyone at all can help.</strong><br />
      Just send me something.. drop me an E-mail and write a bit about a particular function that you like or know a lot about, or even just something you think looks nice and can be usefull as an element of a preset.<br />
      <br />
      Or even make a simple preset and put a description in the comments section of the config.<br />
      <br />
      anything will help<br />
      <br />
      thanks again!</p>
