<div class="posttext">Atero, you realize that there is still an extremely long time before DA's birthday?  I say unstick it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank UnConed, I already was wondering which character I could use for adding comment to scopes and DM's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And please sticky this one, it might be a good help for newbies on the forums, so they don't start spamming right away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I doubt it... most newbies tend to post in unrelated threads. Some people even seem to think that grouping different questions in one thread is good.<br />
<br />
Bah.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They may do but this will help them learn and if it keeps drifting down the page then it will be forgotten about. If those projects were being done and someone put some work into a preset they would make the effort to find it.<br />
<br />
Atero i found your moving particle, it was highly inefficient and was way to complicated to be in beginner tips and tricks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have a question. It is about 3D AVS'ing. Is this always hard, or is there an easy way to do it? I saw El-Vis explanation of his engine, and I found it hard to understand. Also, I haven't got any way to build up my math knowledge in a way positive for AVS. For example: a cube in it's simplest form. Is that possible for me to do? or should I stick to other, simpler things? And if it's possible, can somebody give me a small simple explanation of what to do, or develop my own engine.<br />
<br />
Thanks by advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">3D-Avsing isn't hard.  Do not use Elvis's engine.  The best way to learn how to do it is to do it yourself.  There are a lot of explanations in these forums - Search.  Basically you just have multiply by the rotation matrices to rotate it and then project it onto the 2 dimensional surface.  You can google to figure out more about rotation matrices, or just look through these forums.  3D isn't hard once you figure out how to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good work Deamon - I think its a very positive idea for the forum. Perhaps a sticky isn't the solution - maybe an faq insert?<br />
Rova whats the possibility of having a dedicated avs website hosted on the nullsoft server? Or having a help/tutorial file included with future avs updates.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When ateros primer finally sees the light of day include that in the next update. Hmm, not a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th April 2003, 01:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Dedicated AVS webspace?  Isn't that what this forum is?  I think AVS should come with better documented help and links to useful threads and primers/faq's here.  That would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">raz: the point was that's *not* the way the moving particle works.  it is inefficient but i can't get around that without losing the customizeability.<br />
<br />
and i'm working on avs primer...i promise...it'll be out...sometime... :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th April 2003, 02:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Let me put it this way. People learning what simple scopes do, or a shiton more moving particle presets :D I'm not going to harass you for the primer. I don't want unfinished explanations. It takes how long it takes. How about we stop arguing over whther this should be stickied or not and start adding some tips and tricks people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">One thing about comments: I'm pretty sure that they slow the superscope down slightly, so you might want to go easy on them, and/or remove them after you are done with the preset. I noticed this while working on the neuron preset of &quot;Pixels&quot; (name soon to be changed). On that particular scope, I commented almost every line, and noticed a significant slowdown. AVS still processes these lines of comments just like any other line, apparently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No chance of webspace and I do not have any auhority for the documentation and next release of AVS. SOrry I will see what I can do. and I will try to get them to link to these forums in the next version of winamp/avs maybe a link in the properties or something.<br />
<br />
Erm....I don't mind adding links to the FAQ,etc but first I will have to clean this thread up as I would like the tricks and tips threads to be just that tricks and tips not another general discussion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Go for it Rova. It just makes sence. Delete this post. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looks random now but the other thread is clean</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so that people may read it and if someone doesnt reply to it for some time, it should not go down the draind</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes. please keep posting those tips in the other topic. About the webspace, I finally have the hardware in to start my own webserver. I first got to do some exams (pffft), and then I'll try to get the webserver up. It will likely be dedicated to AVS, with examples, good packs, (and my packs too, of course ;) ), tutorials, faqs, and the best topics on this forum. (is this copyrighted?). So please be patient, it'll come. And when it comes, I'll let you all know about it.<br />
<br />
And please keep those other comments here, so the other topic stays clean as well</div></div><hr />
