      <p class="post-content">Hmm... actually a quick shuffle through revealed that only the random preset cycling is answered in the FAQ not the "AVS pops up on the start of every song". But then again it's not entirely a AVS problem, see it executes the visualization plugin you've chose to run at the start of the song, which currently seems to be in your case: AVS.<br />
      <br />
      To change this go to -&gt; Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Plug-ins and uncheck the box "Auto execute visualization plug-in on playback"<br />
      <br />
      This should kill it :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">In that case I'm sorry to have offended you.<br />
      Why isn't that queston in FAQ? It <u>is</u> a frequent asked question..</p>

      <p class="post-content">My answer would be:<br />
      <font size="1"><br />
      Q: AVS opens/doesn't open every time I start a new song.<br />
      <br />
      A: You can disable/enable this setting by going to the Options &gt; Preferences (Ctrl+P) menu.<br />
      Select Plug-ins (not Visualization) and disable/enable the option "Auto execute visualization plug-in on playback". (first checkbox)<br /></font></p>
