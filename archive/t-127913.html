<div class="posttext">So many of you hate the new avatar, god knows why, maybe it's that you are too weak to handle the truth :D<br />

Anyway, what should i do then? Or does it really matter that much?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, that's sounds like a good idea. And if i make them &quot;universal&quot; without using text or likes, i could just give them away to someone who wants them :D That is, if they are good enough :rolleyes:<br />

*edit*<br />
Btw. Avatar limit size, was 15kb? right? Or was it as high as 20kb?</div></div><hr />

when you dont see a persons actual face, but read his writings (comments), his face gets formed in your mind. but when you see his face you get disappointed with your imagination. so i think you should change your avatar</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's sad to hear. It really is.<br />
It just proves in what kind of a world we live in, where we think more/less about a person by his/her face... It really disapoints me that i wanted to show that im not any fucking hollywood film star just, because i make good presets, participate a lot in the community and overall just want to be a part of avs in anyway i can.<br />
<br />
Well take a good fucking look at me! I make good presets &amp; have time for the community just because i have given up on normal things like taking care of my appeareance...<br />
<br />
I really thought you wouldn't care what i look like, like people didn't care that atero was bi. But i guess you just aren't that tolerant towards different kind of people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I use Photoshop, but school is taking way to much time at the moment. I'll make my avatar by the end of the month.<br />
<br />
And to Tuggummi, I like this avatar better than your first one. And I got a question for you:<br />
<br />
Does it make you feel good when you hear that I got all your packs on my machine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 06:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Daemon, It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside :D<br />
Thank you! I really am glad that someone enjoys my work that much :)<br />
<br />
But i doubt you have the first 3 packs which are: &quot;1st Shot&quot; , &quot;Basic Blocks&quot; &amp; &quot;Progression&quot; , because they have been looong gone and are not available anymore :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you want a REALLY good design &amp; animation program get PHOTOIMPACT!<br />
<br />
It really kicks ass, V8 got the best ratings and is even cheaper than most programs (if you want to buy it :p ).<br />
<br />
I'm using nothing else except MainActor for Video Editing.<br />
<br />
@ Phaze: Why don't you design a dancing, red glowing &quot;P&quot; for yourself??? ;)<br />
<br />
But as we're all changing our Avatars, what about mine? Shall i change it too? Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 13:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Magic.X , nope no ideas whatsoever :p<br />
<br />
Though i like this one and if you're only going to change it, because it such a a big &quot;trend&quot; here then don't do it :D<br />
<br />
And i was going to suggest that dancing P to him also, i was almost willing to do it myself for him if he would just shut up! :blah: :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 13:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i designed mine when i had not really the time so its a quick-made one.<br />
<br />
But as i consider myself as a grafically advanced person (have a look at some of my work) (http://home.pages.at/ptcle/HTML/Pictures/digial%20art.html) i'm thinking about designing a new one.</div></div><hr />

U're saying thy look good then? :D<br />
<br />
But its true, some of them i made out of AVS-Screenshots and others i used vice versa in AVS.<br />
<br />
AVS, Pictures, Videos all a small part of the same stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well avs can be used to make some good looking graphics, this true. However the might look like a bunch of effects just throwed together, which isn't necessarily a good thing :igor:<br />
<br />
But oh hell, i made my own backgrounds a couple of years ago and people today say they look like avs presets.... go figure...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Maybe i'm gonna do another one. Tug, is there still the Avatar filesize restriction if you don't upload it and just add an URL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th March 2003, 07:38</div></div>
