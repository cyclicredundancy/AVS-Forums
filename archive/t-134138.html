      <p class="post-content"><strong>Cut down on avs hours?</strong><br />
      I'm going to take a break from AVS<br />
      In making them there's too much stress<br />
      My hair's falling out, my eyes are red<br />
      All I want to do is go to sleep<br />
      After dinner I go to work<br />
      The computer treats me like a jerk<br />
      The SSCs a wrong, the DMs are wierd<br />
      Before I fix it I'll grow a beard<br />
      <br />
      Any suggestions?:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Make more posts like this. You'll lose contact with AVS in no time (the hard way).<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, go web surfing or get a free MMO(RPG when applies) game.</p>

      <p class="post-content">But no, you see, this is <b>AVS</b> Troubleshooting.<br />
      You're not AVS in either of the two ways, so no.<br />
      <br />
      Just force yourself to some of the newpicks preset... Though I *really* don't recommend that.<br />
      Try getting other distractions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Stop arguing over where it goes and get to the point.<br />
      <br />
      Lemon if you believe it will help your grades then it's for the best. Real life comes first, you can avs whenever but you can't go to school whenever. I think if avs relaxes you though you can continue with it, you can't just work all the time because you want to and your grades will still suffer, you just need to draw the line somewhere.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i like to always think of somethink else that is more domineering.<br />
      in my life, that would be<br />
      *going to the movies. (at least once a day)<br />
      *street fighter ex2 plus arcade (i play once a day until i get the top score)<br />
      *music (play guitar or piano at least an hour a day)<br />
      <br />
      compared to these threee things, avs is nothing at all. its just what i do in my time off, from my time off from work or uni.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      BTW, i think alot of people on this forum are far too touchy about where stuff gets posted and how relevant it is.. If you dont like it, dont read it. and especially, dont reply to it..</p>
