<div class="posttext">I'm going to take a break from AVS<br />
In making them there's too much stress<br />
My hair's falling out, my eyes are red<br />
All I want to do is go to sleep<br />
After dinner I go to work<br />
The computer treats me like a jerk<br />
The SSCs a wrong, the DMs are wierd<br />
Before I fix it I'll grow a beard<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Make more posts like this. You'll lose contact with AVS in no time (the hard way).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, go web surfing or get a free MMO(RPG when applies) game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">:(What do you mean, all I'm asking is how many hours the average AVS artist works per day.  And I'm asking the poetic way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">not a lot unless i got a great idea or know what i'm doing. about 4 days a week i work on avs about half hour a day and about 3 days a week i work on avs about 3 or 4 hours, sometimes more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not too much, but this is the wrong forum. Mod?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, this is the right forum because I have trouble now doing my homework because I spend too much time doing avs, so I'm having TROUBLE with it (get it, TROUBLEshooting)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th May 2003, 17:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">But no, you see, this is AVS Troubleshooting.<br />
You're not AVS in either of the two ways, so no.<br />
<br />
Just force yourself to some of the newpicks preset... Though I *really* don't recommend that.<br />
Try getting other distractions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Stop arguing over where it goes and get to the point.<br />
<br />
Lemon if you believe it will help your grades then it's for the best. Real life comes first, you can avs whenever but you can't go to school whenever. I think if avs relaxes you though you can continue with it, you can't just work all the time because you want to and your grades will still suffer, you just need to draw the line somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i like to always think of somethink else that is more domineering.<br />
in my life, that would be <br />
*going to the movies. (at least once a day)<br />
*street fighter ex2 plus arcade (i play once a day until i get the top score)<br />
*music (play guitar or piano at least an hour a day)<br />
<br />
compared to these threee things, avs is nothing at all. its just what i do in my time off, from my time off from work or uni.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, i think alot of people on this forum are far too touchy about where stuff gets posted and how relevant it is.. If you dont like it, dont read it. and especially, dont reply to it..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Never said I didn't like the thread, just that it's not a problem with AVS. It's an RL priority problem.<br />
<br />
Do what you gotta do man. Lean some funky wizard math and astound us with much goodness when summer comes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I spend about 2 1/2 hrs on AVS, not that I make presets all the time, but time-pass...and i have to cut it down, because studies are increasing day by day and this year is supposed to be very important one for me</div></div><hr />
