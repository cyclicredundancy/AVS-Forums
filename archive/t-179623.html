<div class="posttext">This has probaly been said before:confused:, but i searched and couldn't find it so i'll say it. You should be able to copy an effect or an entire effets list and paste it directly into another preset. It would save people a lot of time and make it a whole lot easier if you had say a 3d ssc you wanted in another preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">...<br />
<br />
Why can't you just save the preset and then add it to the another preset? :igor:<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a little thing under the &quot;+&quot; button that let's you add any preset you want to the current one.</div></div><hr />

(the adding of presets to other presets)<br />
<br />
how r33t</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">how r33t   <br />
<br />
Do you mean l33t?<br />
<br />
I agree with Mr_Nudge, there have been many times when I only needed one SSC or other component and I have to add the whole preset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th May 2004, 05:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm a good thing would be drag&amp;drop between 2 instances of AVS :)<br />
you could open a 2nd instance of winamp+avs, load another preset in it and simply drag the SSC over to the other window</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Doin all that countdown timer stuff to my presets 1 by 1 was annoying, then when I upgraded from WA5.02 to 5.03 all those default install presets i modified got overwritten :/<br />
It'd be nice if I could apply a preset too all the presets in a directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I only needed one SSC or other component and I have to add the whole preset.<br />
<br />
That's why you have a &quot;laboratory&quot; folder where you can save presets that only contain 1 ssc, 1 dm, a half of a preset etc... :igor:<br />
<br />
I can't really see why this is so complicated :p<br />
Maybe im just better using it than you are :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that's about 10 seconds extra time used *g*<br />
plus you know which presets you modified</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah it would be so much easier... like having a single variable for fps instead of a code string... aah but i forgot, if there already is means to do it people don't want it to be more easier around here. Why that would mean too much of new people coming to avs and we can't just simply tolerate that... now can we? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th May 2004, 03:11</div></div>

<div class="posttext">tug there's more important things to fix/add:<br />
(quoting my favorites from the current wishlist :))<br />
Allow for double or half-sized Effect lists so an author can choose between detail and speed better. Provide double/half sized buffer saves too and allow Dynamic Movements to read out of them.<br />
- good for raytracing presets and other CPU intense presets<br />
<br />
Allow the AVS editor to be resized (only resizing the preset-treeview is enough)<br />
- would be helpful for large presets (architectural design? :))<br />
<br />
A full blown AVS language including flow control operations (repeat..until, while..do, if..then..else, case..of), commenting (/*..*/, //..CRLF), sub-routine definitions (function cube(x)=x*x*x), additional unary and binary operators (div, mod, shl, shr, inc, dec, etc.).<br />
- i'd especially appreciate functions :)<br />
<br />
err... note to ucd: you can remove some parts of that entry:<br />
- commenting<br />
- mod (floating point modulo (FPREM1) still missing though)<br />
- if..then..else<br />
they're already in it<br />
<br />
Fix the preset structure tree sometimes showing an element in the wrong position after dragging it.<br />
-  really disturbing</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that is not the case tuggummi, i'm sorry if that seemed so :(<br />
<br />
it's just that afaik justin left nullsoft and if he or anyone is ever going to develop AVS any further, then imho it should be something that is really improving AVS and not something that is already in.<br />
I know you are not a fan of techy presets but what if the improvements go in a direction you yourself can use?<br />
<br />
And Mr Nudge: your question was answered by Tuggummi I think.<br />
To copy a preset to an effect list, simply save it, make a new preset or load another preset and click the &quot;+&quot;, click &quot;Presets&quot; and then select the preset you just saved. This preset will then appear in a new effect list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd May 2004, 12:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i know that, it's just a bitch when you only want one thing from the middle of a huge prestet. Thats why i think you should be able to copy effects. This forum is called avs &quot;wishlist&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">But the elf/gnoll/fairy who used to fulfill our wishes has left this magical kingdom :(<br />
There isn't much else to do than cope with the methods we already have :hang:<br />
<br />
I (and i guess 96% of the forummongers) suspect that avs will never ever be updated again or it will happen outside their time (when they still make avs)<br />
We don't like it, you don't like it, no one likes it, but it's the harsh reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if this is a wishlist, then I wish... (since we're talking about fairies and stuff) we get regular updates...<br />
<br />
But I hope we don't have to use fairies and get Nullsoft to either give us the source or get someone else on AVS updates</div></div><hr />

This just didn't make any sense to me, so i assumed from that you are shabaviz, sorry again, but im glad you aren't :)<br />

Why it was confusing? Well tell me how submiting presets would help fixing the bugs in the editor :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you Raz. They don't want to give us the source code, but what if they let us look at parts of it. Certain functions and the interface ect. If someone knows how to do something faster or fix bug x then they could copy and paste. There would be no problems with multiple versions of AVS floating around because we wouldn't have the parts to make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st May 2004, 16:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, code talk, im out :p<br />
<br />
But i'll just say it's interesting, but would still leave most of the things not-fixed. Because they couldn't submit that much of the source without someone figuring it out how to make it work without even without the full source.<br />
But anyway, speculation speculation... i will use milkdrop sooner than nullsoft will give even a tiny part of the avs source to the community :D</div></div><hr />

UnConeD seems the most knowledged one of us, he's a good coder and he's also an admin here [so it seems to me that he has some links to Nullsoft] =&gt; maybe we should pay UCD to hack Nullsoft's servers, get the AVS source outta there and work on fixing the bugs :D<br />
I would give him a 100$ for that... dunno if he sould agree :D</div></div><hr />
