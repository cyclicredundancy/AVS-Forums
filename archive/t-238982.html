      <p class="post-content">Yes he must be a luddite for complaining about a highly technical piece of sofware performing less efficiently. Why do people use that term? It just smacks of ignorance and buzzword insulting to me. Don't you think it is just a little bit ironic using something as anachronistic as Ludditism from the industrial revolution in an argument about software?<br />
      <br />
      You could claim that "Luddite" has become an accepted term for one who opposes the advancement of technology (dubiously I would argue).. but software version changes?! Give me a fucking break.<br />
      <br />
      "I made this new version of my software and its full of bugs and crashes all the time.. But you have to upgrade otherwise you are a Luddite, hur hur"</p>

      Luddites don't use huigh-tech stuff, period. In fact, the more extreme Luddites go around <b>smashing</b> any tech they can get their hands on.<br />
