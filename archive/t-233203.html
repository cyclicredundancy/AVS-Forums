Feel free to modify or use parts of this preset to make your own  presets, but don't copy the whole preset and claim you did that  preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, sorry if we appear a bit rude and not nice at all, but we get tired sometimes to have to tell things 200 times ..<br />
We're all just really nice guys (okay, most of us :p)<br />
<br />
Okay, i'll stop about the .rar file and the missing credits.. (next time: just add someone's name and original preset name in the misc/comment, it's just 2 seconds of work)<br />
<br />
A short constructive review:<br />
First One - Why have such a nice scope if you cover it up with that movement? at least set that movement filter to blend.<br />
This is like installing a Lada engine in a Porsche :igor:<br />
<br />
Inside the cockpit <br />
 generally:<br />
Too fast my eyes!!!<br />
 Technically: <br />
The color reduction:<br />
I don't see the effect of it.<br />
<br />
The ssc: having n set to 1100 is a bit overdone in my eyes. 400 or 500 should be plenty IMO.<br />
tpi.. $pi is integrated now so you don't need to use acos(-1) anymore.<br />
remove Rot and Point. Rot is constant, so there's no need to set them to 0 each frame, especially if they aren't even used:<br />
calculating x1 and y1 the secondary time like this is useless, especially if you don't include point=point+1; per point.<br />
<br />
DM: Rot is defined but not used. better remove it.<br />
x and y are static, so there's no need for a &gt;dynamic&lt; movement. Just use a normal movement with the same settings.<br />
a small detail: multiplying is faster than dividing. use *0.5 instead of /2<br />
<br />
Also, you entire preset is inside a ignore/replace effectlist. move everything outside it because effectlists are slow. Creating AVS presets technicalwise is all about efficiency.<br />
<br />
My advice: Read the tutorials, because it seems you copypasted half your code here to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that's what i've pretty much always said at the end of the comment of my presets (except certain packs like the AVS PARTY series or strobotonic ones)<br />
<br />
But, like the kind hearted trusting fool that i am, i expected that people would not be stupid about such simple thing as &quot;give credit where credit is due&quot; and decided not to yack about it in the comment. But my faith in humanity has been abused time and time again... Maybe PAK-9 is right and people really are idiots and i should include 3 pages of legal notices and license agreements on every one of my 20 packs and 778 avs presets i've made.<br />
<br />
This little rant here isn't exactly directed at fastingaciu even though the opportunity is here, im just a little tired and i have sand in my vagina, maybe i should go put my nightly astro glide on...<br />
<br />
Stay cool people! :cool::up:</div></div><hr />
