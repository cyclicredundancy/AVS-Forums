<div class="posttext">No, it's not what you think. :) <br />
<br />
Ok, so I'm doing this thing where every tueday, I go to this middle school at about 6:30pm, and practice with my city band.  There is absolutley no one in that school except the people in the band.  Not even the janitor, which is really amazing since he's always there.....<br />
<br />
Anyway, there's this one room in that school that gets used every day as a daycare center for kids about 5-12 years of age.  And every tuesday after practice, I print off an AVS screenshot and stick it under their door.  I've been only doing this for a couple weeks, and I want to continue on with it.  <br />
<br />
So do any of you have any good screenshots of your presets you want to show off? :D <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this sounds like a sick or stupid idea (please tell me if it is), but I just thought it would be fun! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sure, I'll make some when I get home. But... why ffs are you putting AVS screenshots under a daycare center? ;) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Pixelcraft</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th August 2003, 07:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Because there's people there every day, kind of like your sig :D <br />
<br />
btw: what does 'ffs' mean?  I just can't figure that one out....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">damn I lost my entire collection of shots :(. Just wanted to post them, but the dir where they should be in was entirely gone. <br />
<br />
Sorry Pixelcraft, maybe I'll do some shots again in the near future.<br />
<br />
One question: do you give nice credit with all the pictures you are &quot;publishing? ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Pixelcraft</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th August 2003, 18:49</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, you'll get credit for them :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS stills aren't really that great.  AVS is sweet because of it's music-reactivity.  I don't really think this is that great of a way to spread AVS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Click the 'W's in my sig for two shots you could use. I might put up some high res shots of other presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wouldnt wory about credit too much.<br />
I mean, how likely is it that someoen see's these pics and connects them somehow with pixel. And then goes: <br />
<br />
&quot;wow, this guy is a geniouse!, i have no idea what these pics are of, but i can tell he is a god among men! Lets give him a high paying job and a company car!&quot;<br />
<br />
use anything you lke of mine =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hungryskull, that's great. :weird: <br />
<br />
I don't know why I'm asking you guys, I could just take screenshots of people's presets myself....<br />
<br />
I don't really care what resolution it is, I could always resize it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can use my avs wallpapers if you like, just go to my devart page and search for them http://tuggummi.deviantart.com<br />
<br />
But don't use the actual presets, like anubis said, still avs is pretty horrible to watch. The magic comes from the movement and music reactivity.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">just to make the kids happy (i guess? )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if i was a kid and a strange man was walking buy our door every tuesday giving us strange pictures, i wouldn't be happy about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I have no idea why I am doing this. :confused: <br />
<br />
I live in isolation, I have no sisters, no brothers (well, I have a half brother, but he's a marine in spain right now) and nothing ever to do, so I guess I'm just bored. :D  Yeah I know this is kind of stupid...../me slaps myself across the face/ Why did I make this stupid thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">horse-fly</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th August 2003, 20:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you guys have to think about it in a different way.  don't look at this subjectively.  There are a bunch of kids at school, right? so pix walks around trying to brighten the days of these dreary students, who are currently at school (the cause of the drearyness)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th August 2003, 22:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I totally agree with that. I would love it if some nut would hang the school full with nice and bright pictures of AVS. I guess it lives up the place quite a lot. Maybe they even hang the pictures on the wall ;)</div></div><hr />
