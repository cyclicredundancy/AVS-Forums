      No, it's not what you think. :)<br />
      <br />
      Ok, so I'm doing this thing where every tueday, I go to this middle school at about 6:30pm, and practice with my city band. There is absolutley no one in that school except the people in the band. Not even the janitor, which is really amazing since he's always there.....<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, there's this one room in that school that gets used every day as a daycare center for kids about 5-12 years of age. And every tuesday after practice, I print off an AVS screenshot and stick it under their door. I've been only doing this for a couple weeks, and I want to continue on with it.<br />
      <br />
      So do any of you have any good screenshots of your presets you want to show off? :D<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure if this sounds like a sick or stupid idea (please tell me if it is), but I just thought it would be fun! :D</p>

      <br />
      Sorry Pixelcraft, maybe I'll do some shots again in the near future.<br />

      One question: do you give nice credit with all the pictures you are "publishing? ;).</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS stills aren't really that great. AVS is sweet because of it's music-reactivity. I don't really think this is that great of a way to spread AVS.</p>

      I mean, how likely is it that someoen see's these pics and connects them somehow with pixel. And then goes:<br />
      <br />
      "wow, this guy is a geniouse!, i have no idea what these pics are of, but i can tell he is a god among men! Lets give him a high paying job and a company car!"<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hungryskull, that's great. :weird:<br />
      <br />
      I don't know why I'm asking you guys, I could just take screenshots of people's presets myself....<br />

      I don't really care what resolution it is, I could always resize it.</p>

      But don't use the actual presets, like anubis said, still avs is pretty horrible to watch. The magic comes from the movement and music reactivity.</p>

      <br />
      I live in isolation, I have no sisters, no brothers (well, I have a half brother, but he's a marine in spain right now) and nothing ever to do, so I guess I'm just bored. :D Yeah I know this is kind of stupid...../me slaps myself across the face/ Why did I make this stupid thread?</p>

      <p class="post-content">you guys have to think about it in a different way. don't look at this subjectively. There are a bunch of kids at school, right? so pix walks around trying to brighten the days of these dreary students, who are currently at school (the cause of the drearyness)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I totally agree with that. I would love it if some nut would hang the school full with nice and bright pictures of AVS. I guess it lives up the place quite a lot. Maybe they even hang the pictures on the wall ;)</p>
