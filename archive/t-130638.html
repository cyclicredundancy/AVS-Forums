      <p class="post-content">Well blurred vision looks ok &amp; Worm hole Travel looks kinda cool too, but needs a fast brite at the end imho.<br />
      <br />
      Midnight rain is just chaotic &amp; The dream just looks like random stuff put together.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I share Tuggummi's opinion 'bout the presets.<br />
      Alter the SSC in The Dream and change the Dynamic DisMods to Dynamic Movements.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Midnight Rain - Neat idea an effects<br />
      <br />
      Blurred Vision - It's ok, but not really blurry enough to live up to its name.<br />
      <br />
      The Dream - This one's a bit.......unorthodox. It's actually kind of cool though. :up:<br />
      <br />
      Wormhole Travel: Where's the "hole"? It would look better with a DM tunnel to go through.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Pretty good but still needs more optimization and care...Like a baby ! :)<br />
      The Dream - pretty chaotic and looks kinda ugly,but the colors are nice.<br />
      Midnight Rain - good idea but it has a pixel look that i dont like that much.<br />
      Blurred Vision - this looks a bit better then the rest :) Its the best from this mini pack IMO.<br />
      Worm Hole Travel - where is the wormhole ? cant see it...Anyway its ok,i like the combination with dynamic shift and zooming.<br />
      Overall minipack rating - 3.5<br />
      Tips - learn to code better and that will give you wings !!! Like RedBull :) Keep AVSing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd say basically the same as everyone else. You need to work on coding some, but they are alright.</p>

      <p class="post-content">midnight rain- too fast, the DM looks too wierd at times (all garbled)<br />
      <br />
      the dream- too chaotic, I picture dreams as being slow, but very abstract like you made it.</p>
