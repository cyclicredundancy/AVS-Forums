      <p class="post-content"><strong>Final Draft AVS Pack</strong><br />
      Here it is...the (almost) final draft for my AVS Pack.<br />
      <br />
      It's still a draft because I would all forum members (don't worry newbies...your opinions are valued also) to help me pick out their favorites out of this pack before I make the final decision as to which ones to keep. I've seriously reduced the size to only my favorites.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for all your help in my other threads. I just need to have you say which are your favorites on some of the presets that are remixes/very similar presets.<br />
      <br />
      The other threads I still consider active, because I still have questions about DMs in them &amp; stuff. Keep checking in on them frequently, too.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for all your help, guys.</p>

      <p class="post-content">First, I'll list the exceptionally good ones :<br />
      <br />
      Drunken Smoking Flares : It's... Wow... Might want to use less water bump tho - Water bumps have a HUGE hit on FPS.<br />
      <br />
      Well, that's about it for me... :(<br />
      <br />
      Things that you should know : Don't put 2 or more presets that looks a lot alike.<br />
      Try not to use excessive amount of things (Especially Sauron's Eye... that's a cr*pload of starfields...)<br />
      <br />
      Just do a few more editing (And add some coding, of course ;) ), and your pack might reach the 3.5 star mark (Sorry, but I'm kinda doubtful if you can get 4 star for now... :( But try if you can :) ;)).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>proposed exchange</strong><br />
      You recommended not keeping very similar presets. You also recommended adding some coding, so I combined the two ideas to come up with the idea to exchange one repetitious preset with *ONE* of the zipped presets I'm including in this reply. I'm exchanging the Rainbow Swirl version of my Disco Da Funk with one of the attached presets.<br />
      <br />
      Tell me which is your favorite</p>

      <p class="post-content">2.0 one is quite nice, but the significant hit in the Framerate (OnBeat fx list) is quite big... The changes aren't very noticable either - Try to do something that would give a big change without <i>that</i> big slowdown.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>what do you recommend?</strong><br />
      Is the framerate that big of a deal since I'm just learning how to do DMs? I seriously would like to try to publish my pack ASAP. What did you have in mind for me to add that wouldn't kill the framerate?<br />
      <br />
      How many stars is this one? Does the DM make it any higher stars?<br />
      <br />
      Oh, yeah...I modified a DM to where part of the time it looked like starburster (on beat), but the rest of the time it looked like the normal DM. That was cool...just felt like saying that.<br />
      <br />
      I've just been making some decisions on my own about which to keep in the final AVS pack, so I hope nobody misses the old ones. :)<br />
      <br />
      Okay-guess that's all for now.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks again</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey Chaz. Sorry it took so long, but I've been pretty damn busy lately. But anyway, let's get to it:<br />
      <br />
      double vision of colours: Somewhat simple, but some very nice effects in places, especially the glowing. Best version is 2.5 movement remix. 3/5<br />
      Eye Spy-colorific scopes: Great use of water bumps (albeit a little overkill), and the gradient colour SSC is cool as well. But you might want to find a better use for it. 3/5<br />
      kaleidascopophobia: Pretty harsh on the eyes. Liked the movement though. 2.5/5<br />
      Escape from coloristiconica: Damn you use big words. :) This one's nice as well. Turning off some of the fireworks improved on the overall experience. 2.5/5<br />
      Disco DaFunk: That SSC is a mighty fine piece of work. The occasional flashes of red aren't quite at home. Best version is tornado. 3/5<br />
      drunken smoking flares: Another good application for the water bump. Colours are somewhat bland, but overall a great preset. 3.5/5<br />
      ghosts in another dimension: Hmm, not very ghosty, but okay for what it is. 2.5/5<br />
      chaz parkinsophobic: I thought it looked like something that justin would make. The spattery effect is just lovely, although a bit hard on the eyes. 3/5<br />
      Shockwave Damage Show: This is pretty bland, but keep working with it. 2/5<br />
      4th of July: A good example of "less is more". Best version is smoke &amp; comets. 3/5<br />
      robomatic colortile scopes: I have no idea what people see in the Spiral Graph SSC, but it's just me. Another nice movement effect as well. 2.5/5<br />
      mirrors mirrors everywhere: A bit too psychedelic, but again, the movement saves it. I didn't know you could set RGB values in frame, either. 3/5<br />
      psycho color well: It looks a bit too much like previous presets to me. 2/5<br />
      Artificial Intelligence Generator: This is more like it, but could use some work. Great combination of the mirror and blitter feedback. 3/5<br />
      Journey paranoya color: This seems to belong to the family of the last few presets, but still takes its own direction. 2.5/5<br />
      rotating color meltaway superscope: Wow, this is awesome! The melting effect is fabulous. Tone down the colour of the SSC and you've got one hell of a relaxation preset. 3.5/5<br />
      random color generator: Ahh, my eyes! You might want to play with this a little. Turn the output on the list to 50/50, maybe. 2/5<br />
      color waterfall: That's the most psychedelic thing I've ever seen! Still good, though. Try making it more dynamic. 2.5/5<br />
      color blobulae mind beaters: This is quite nice to look at. Sure beats having to use stacks of starfields. 3/5<br />
      Sauron's Fiery Eye: Ah, the legendary LOTR eye. It's definitely improved since 2.5. Adding a unique tone might help to make it more fiery. 3.5/5<br />
      <br />
      The verdict: A damn good start to an AVS career (for want of a better word). Some presets were a bit too similar, but you made up for this with some great coding and use of some "underground" effects like the water bumps. Keep working at it, you're doing a mighty fine job. My favourite is drunken smoking flares.<br />
      <br />
      Aesthetics: :) :) :) :( :(<br />
      Originality: :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
      Overall: :) :) :) :( :(</p>
