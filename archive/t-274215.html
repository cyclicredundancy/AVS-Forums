<div class="posttext">We often get replies from people that the tips and tricks thread is too large and messy to read.<br />
<br />
I often read about ideas for PDF files, but you can't edit those. Besides, there will most likely be many different versions after a while, plus that experience on this forum told me that noone will pick up the task to filter the entire tips&amp;tricks thread to one PDF file - face it, we're just that lazy. (including me)<br />
<br />
so the idea for a wiki for AVS came up.<br />
A few of the benefits that I see for a wiki would be <br />
- You can easily link between techniques so you don't have to explain things 2000 times for almost equal stuff.<br />
- It's always up to date.<br />
- You don't need to have ages of free time as you can do something useful in under 5 minutes.<br />
- a search function<br />
- not messy (!)<br />
<br />
I've put an empty (TEMPORARY, for testing purpouses etc) wiki on my site already, but I'm having some difficulties with it. |link| (http://warrior-of-the-light.net/wiki/)<br />
<br />
We could go for a dedicated wiki-host aswell. |list| (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wiki_Science:How_to_start_a_Wiki#.22Hosted_wiki.22_and_Wiki_hosts).<br />
Or does someone else have a server that could be used?<br />
<br />
It could be filled with:<br />
- the benefits of AVS and it's limitations.<br />
- explanations of the effects (could be copied from the tutorials?)<br />
- tricks<br />
- please, also write an article about yourself as an AVS artist, your packs, groups..<br />
- (avs devellopment discussions?)<br />
- links to tutorials<br />
- links to deviantart, visbot, customize, etc<br />
- more<br />
<br />
--<br />
so, is this idea as bad as my presets or do you guys like the idea (more importantly, would you help to write some articles?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's a great idea. We will finally have (mostly) all information/tutorials on AVS in basically one resource. I will definately try to help with whatever I can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The Tips &amp; Tricks Thread is way too old and contains much useless or too common information for today's standards. Would be best if it would be locked and let it sink down the drain in fact.<br />
<br />
There are much better resources nowadays like Pak's guide and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the visbot wiki wasn't used back then, but i'll give my full support to your's. i'd make it mandatory though to make all contributions being available under public domain licenses such as gnu fdl (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html) or creative commons. this is important so the wiki could be mirrored. i'm saying this as i might wanna do this, as you website never gives me good speeds.</div></div><hr />
