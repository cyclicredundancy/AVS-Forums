<div class="posttext">Hey MaTTFURY....uhhh im probably stating the obvious but you attract flames like shit does flies....maybe you should try a different approach to posting....like you could suk up big time to all the &quot;major&quot; avs artists buy telling them how much you absolutely,most definitely LOVE their presets....maybe they wont flame you anymore...but i dunno. Im with you though...i also get crude and unforgiving comments...like THEY are the masters of the forum and THEY decide what is right and wrong....:mad: <br />
<br />
What when they were new i bet they never got flamed.....oh well...<br />
<br />
<br />
ATTENTION:potential flamers plaese take note of SuperToast's post....thank you</div></div><hr />

MaTTFURY....you are a TOTAL newbie and your constant whinening for help is utter sh1te.Cant you do anything for yourself?Cant you at least put in SOME effort to do on your own? :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">The modern education system has turned you into a whining crybaby who needs to be spoonfed everything in nice, prepackaged portions. Drop that attitude and start learning for yourself. You will be doing this for the rest of your life once you leave school, so you might as well start practicing now.<br />
<br />
There is no magic potion that will turn you into an AVS expert. The only thing that helps is spending time with the program, like everyone else here has done. We've been AVSing for /years/.<br />
<br />
If you have the attention span of a goldfish, then do something about it. Stop doing 10 things at the same time and focus on one thing. Shut down MSN, you're probably not having any interesting conversations there anyway.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god, pick up a book on spelling, grammar and typography, or at least study your own typing and compare it with others. There are rules when communicating through writing, and not following them makes you appear like a baby.<br />
<br />
This is not a flame, this is advice. Clunk.</div></div><hr />
