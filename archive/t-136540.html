<div class="posttext">Friends of mine and myself are avid music writers and are comming on the scene in the live music shabang in my city. I am involved in a couple different projects and I'm organising a VJ compliment to live gigs. <br />
<br />
If you would like to help (be involved) and all credit would go to artists. Read over these points and see if your applicable.<br />
<br />
- Anybody with knowlage in Digital projectors. Brand names, Quality, cost, ordering, setups.<br />
<br />
- Hardware issues, minimum computa requirements for setup in a venue, Best resolution and things concerning framerates and responsivity.<br />
<br />
- YOUR PRESETS ... Do you want people to see them and contribute your works of visual art. The two projects I am involved in are quite different, which are &quot;The witness relocation program&quot; ... an up and comming new school punk rock band. And a hip-hop colaboration involving myself, and others. It you have anything that you think might suit &quot;Speak up&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at having a running AVS remix of a couple of my presets and with anyone in this AVS community who would wish to contribute with Presets that will suit the show.<br />
<br />
I will also look at taking shots (digital camera or otherwise) of preformances including the VJ'ing and will postem here or give them to contributers so they can see and people can look in awe of their stuff happening in live venue rather than cyberspace or their desktop. So they may revel in the glorious fruitful bounds of attention and adoration that comes with stardom. eeeh yeh I'm sure you belive that.<br />
<br />
Seriously tho if you want to colaborate on this project POST AWAY.<br />
<br />
Visual Agnosia<br />
<br />
P.s. I was thinking of a VJ name ... what do you think of <br />
<br />
&quot;Mix-master-matosis&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I would gladly submit a few presets. It would rule seeing them on a bigass projector :D I don't think i could make themed presets to something like that though. It would probably be a few flow presets because they react best and no one watching a band cares about how much work went into making them.<br />
<br />
By the way, it's got to be &quot;visualagnosia&quot; for your vj name. It's perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">VisualAgnosia</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th May 2003, 08:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Sure thing.. I agree Raz.<br />
<br />
Post your presests either on this thread or PM them to me.<br />
<br />
Here's a mp3 which i made and uploaded to MP3.com. Just as an indication of what sort of Big Beat stuff I like to make. This is one track which i uploaded but at the time it wasn't polished, but the body and the feel of the track is all there. i uploaded it about 5 months ago. Mp3.com takes a few weeks to approve tracks and I kinda forgot about it. By all means have a listen. I recomend not hearing the lo-fi version and go for the download. lo-fi does no justice.<br />
<br />
http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/3101/3101438.html <br />
<br />
I put it under the name Faserm which I've been known to use and the track is called &quot;The B that B&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's a couple of flow-type-presets. One i'd already made and one i made just now. I can't do the whole mp3 thing cause i'm on crap 56k dialup and it cuts out very often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sid_1 - this would be my first attempt at VJ'ing. I dont suppose there would be to much to it besides setting up the whole thing. Snot like you have to freak techniques on a cross fader or anything.<br />
<br />
Just had the idea this weekend with my mates when they were gigging. So likley in ther next couple of preformances or definatly when the hiphop project takes off. Dont worry I'll keep you posted. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what presets to run for a kicking punkrock band (what would suit)  When I get my project running live It'll be understandable but perhaps someone could enlighten me as to a good way (tastful) to apply AVS or sertain presets to a punkrock vibe... One might assosiate AVS with electronic music as with raves and such but surely could work with something that wasn't traditionaly rave orientated type preset.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recent stuff on my deviantart account (http://unconed.deviantart.com) is not bad either, if I say so myself ;) (elevation is neato).<br />
<br />
You better post tons of pictures here or we'll all be mad at you ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Use anything by me if you want. Make sure you test the prests first. Nothing will put a damper on the evening like a popup saying winamp has crashed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Naa sorry Unconed I wont use your presets because they're just not good enough. Mabey if you practice a bit more and learn how to make prsets that dont use the standard trans and renderers.<br />
<br />
Seriously dude I'd freak out and run under a bus if you wouldn't let me use some of your presets. Thankya vmuch. Yes I will post tons of pictures but it's not in a couple of days so be patient. I need to think about digital projectors and weather or not to buy one or just rent one. And if so what my best options are as far as that is concerned. I dont like to just through my money away. <br />
<br />
I totaly agree Jakelsafar dont worry I would test run it for sure. That would suck like nothing else</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but my presets are quite beat dependable and highly optimized for trance,dance,techno etc... Doubt my presets will be useful for your gig.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sid_1 - <br />
<br />
Heard of j-ded but not impunity. The bands called &quot;witness Relocation Program&quot; their new on the scene, the drummer used to be in the band &quot;The Sty&quot; which I was involved with (all Guys I jam with regularly). But the hip hop thing hasn't got a name yet it's in development its involving that same drummer and likley my brother and another heres a sample of an &quot;old&quot; track of my bro's which happens to be on mp3.com.au http://www.mp3.com.au/artist.asp?id=7732 . <br />
<br />
I'll contact you if you like when their playing next and mabey you can team up with me and be a part of it. Mabey even get a Adelaide VJ syndicate happening and do visuals for other bands and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Visag - good luck with your first gig!<br />
<br />
For project I'd reccommend a minimum 1000 ansi lumens projector. When you're buying look for features like through distance, svideo/av/monitor imputs, contrast ratio and bulb life.<br />
<br />
Its probably worth your while hiring one to start off with but hell why not buy one outright. You can pick up pretty descent ones on ebay for a bit over a grand. <br />
<br />
Also get yourself a video mixer - running two machines if definately worth your while and a video mixer gives you the effective music simulation that avs can't!<br />
<br />
Trippy visuals are great things but! If it don't work with the music it just won't go down that special. <br />
<br />
I'd reccommend rabid hamsters r2e plugin for a bit of fun also. <br />
<br />
Then when you want to video mix - try something like robotfunks flowmotion :)<br />
<br />
If you want to make the move to buy yourself a video mixer let me know. I can get a mx12 for around $650 (which is damn cheap).</div></div><hr />
