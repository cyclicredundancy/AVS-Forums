<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I could not find a more suitable one.<br />
The spectrum analyzer classic plugin is great. I like it a lot. I wanna congratulate the creator for it. <br />
I want to know if there is a way to contact him to ask him if he can add a couple of things to it but I cant seem to find the option for that in the winamp website. There is no contact information nor is there a option to contact the member.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how to do that?<br />
<br />
Also if someone knows a simple spectrum analyzer which has the option to change the decibel levels and the frequencies please share it with me. That is what I would like to have on the classic spectrum analyzer. Would id be too difficult to add these options?<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">looks like he only ever published a geocities (http://web.archive.org/web/20090311062231/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/9546/) email and that service no longer exists</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes looks like it.<br />
<br />
Well if someone can do this (edit the analyzer to be scalable and have the decibels and frequencies being able to adjust) please tell me. I can donate for the effort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This is actually part of my problem. I have downloaded some AVS analyzers which should have the option i need but when i run them on winamp they run with a delay (lag). The response is not instant - 10-15 ms delay which messes up everything. I dont know if this is a problem with the fact that i'm running it from winamp or my cpu is slow (Core i3 2,13 Ghz).<br />
<br />
I also like the classic analyzer more for its visual options.</div></div><hr />
