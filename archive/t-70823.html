Shouldnt i be able to pull it off?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes, you should be able to pull it off, but it depends on which AVS you are trying to load.<br />
<br />
Some AVS have such graphical complexity that even a very fast computer cannot run it at lightning speed.<br />
<br />
Try resizing your window to a smaller size, so that it is comfortable enough for your speeds, and the computers speeds.  It is a compromising situation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="posttext">That is why optimizing comes in handy. For example, I saw a pack that had four water bumps effects in a row in it (very slow). The same effect could be generated by using just one scatter effect.<br />
<br />
 I also find that some packs have more than one movement in them. All custom movements can be combined into one movement, except when using a preset movement, where you do not know the math.<br />
<br />
 A tool to help a person with optimizing is the windowed performance slider in the display options. Slide it down a bit, and see if you can change your vis to get the framerate you had before adjusting the slider (and keep it looking about the same).<br />
<br />
 I usually leave the slider at the halfway mark, so that I can make good AVSs for both slower computers (compared to this p3 933) and to allow good framerates on high fullscreen resolutions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I said this a while ago, but I will bring it up again because it's relevent. If you can do it (ie have WinXP), turn alpha blending on and put the slider a hair away from &quot;none&quot;. You will get about a 25-35% increase in windowed frame rate.<br />
<br />
I think working with the constant overhead of frame rate really adds something to design. It's like your working with a very limited resourse or fuel. At the same time though, if you create a masterpiece and it brings your computer down to 11-12 fps fullscreen, I say do it. Even if a computer slower than yours isn't going to be able to handle it. They will eventually upgrade and have a nice treat waiting for them when they do. :D</div></div><hr />
