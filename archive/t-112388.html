<div class="posttext">This zip file contains about 50 AVS presets.  They are relatively simple, but great eye-candy, and easy to manipulate (none have the usual 30 lines of math...)<br />
Opinions?<br />
PS-I like mirrors...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's a decent amount of presets there. My big beef though is that they're all static.<br />
<br />
It's typical when you're starting out to make presets like that and say &quot;Hey, you don't need all that code&quot;. The problem with that is the you can only do so much with the predefined stuff, and in the end a lot of them look the same.<br />
<br />
Coding lets you do new and interesting things, even remeke most standard movements and scopes into something cooler.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with noob presets though. We've all been there. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get cocky, those effects are old and tired and a lot of the presets are ugly compared to what the more experienced avsers can make without using code. Code isn't everything but it sure does help a lot. I agree with what Jaheckelsafar said but I would also add that code lets you do what you want in AVS, ie. if you have a really cool idea for an AVS preset it isn't likely to be impossible with code.<br />
<br />
The other thing that puts me off of noob presets is that I can look at them and see exactly what has gone towards making them without even opening the editor window.<br />
<br />
Anyway, have fun in the world of AVS - and do use code, it is more than worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's just that I've seen SO many of the elaborate, complex presets that although do create interesting things, don't seem to have much reaction with the music.  I don't see the point of that in this arena.<br />
But, true, in looking back I see that there are a few in the collection that shouldn't have been included...weren't done or something.  Will keep trying!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I personally don't think that avs is all about reacting to the music. For me its a challenge, to make something complex and visaully impressive whilst getting a high framerate and possibly even converting maths to art. Obviously reactivity is a bonus, but sometimes its hard to make something go to the music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Um...what does 'avs' stand for again?<br />
The challenge to create some new and interesting effect, that's exactly what I figured.  I'll give credit where credit is due of course, many of you have come up with amazing stuff...but...for a different purpose obviously than visuals that are intended to go along with music. One man's opinion.<br />
Take your minds off this for a while, and go rant about idiot drivers...<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">:igor: that's VERY important indeed...<br />
Most of the presets we make are beat-controlled. When AVS detects a beat (all built-in), you can make AVS start or stop zooming in or out or do... whatever you tell it to do. You also can add spectrums or oscilloscopes that reflect the music. Without it, a preset can become pretty boring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's not necessary, but don't expect kickass preset(s).<br />
<br />
Heck :<br />
__<br />
<br />
Why to press play before starting :<br />
<br />
-There is absolutely no input other than frames and pixel/point.<br />
-All your scopes are belong to--- Err, I mean, all your scopes will be either limping or showing no signs of life. No, CPR won't save it.<br />
-You moving particles won't be moving.<br />
-All Render/Simple will do is showing you a more frame-intensive version of x=i*2-1;y=0 (Or 0.5 or -0.5);<br />
-AVS is originally made to make visualizations that reflect the music in a way. Not playing the music defeats the original purpose, don't it?<br />
__<br />
<br />
Or, put in short : Just press &quot;play&quot;. It's &quot;x&quot; on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
But then, you can press play after you start, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I feel silly having to explain this...but that was sarcasm with the whole 'press play before creating' stuff...I always play good, strong-beat stuff while playing with avs.<br />
Anyway, I'll try harder...both with my complexity and humor...<br />

That made me laugh because *now* I spend hours optimising my presets after I make them, sometimes dragging a 10fps behemoth all the way up to 20fps.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm going to make predator eye view 2 for my pack after next, it will have a superscope made running man, superscope trees, a dm plane and the camera will move as though it were jumping from tree to tree... its a side project i've been working on that will take a while yet to finish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">20 fps?  If that's about what presets should be viewed at, than my earlier comments about the complex ones not reacting to the music much needs to be taken back.  Maybe my computer is just a POS...<br />
sorry.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th November 2002, 22:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">What computer do you have?<br />
<br />
Firstly. AVS is really only runable in resolutions like 400x300 and 320x240 without it being really slow or really low-res.<br />
<br />
Secondly. Even if your computer is a POS you can enjoy these presets. These are optimised massively (and also a bit noobish).<br />
<br />
Try turning off 'wait for retrace' when running in a window, you may even get more than 100 fps in average window sizes. These are designed for 640x480+ though.</div></div><hr />
