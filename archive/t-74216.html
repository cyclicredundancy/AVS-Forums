      <p class="post-content"><strong>Benchmark</strong><br />
      Everything computers has a benchmark. I have not seen one done for AVS though. So I am proposing that we decide on a set of presets and size of the AVS window and other various settings. I am not sure if AVS uses integer, floating point or both. But these kind of things are what should be concidered when deciding on a preset.<br />
      So is anyone interested? If this has already been done please tell me so I can shut up, and go back to my corner.</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS is influenced by many things... you'd need to settle on a standard MP3 too, as CPU usage can vary if the currently playing MP3 is a complex or simple one. Not to mention the fact that AVS's FPS read-out is all you could benchmark, which is not very exact.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Understood, but a audio source is not required for avs to work, just not as exciting. The FPS may not be exact but, appears to be stable in its readings. For example:<br />
      <br />
      Preset= UnConed - Energy Box<br />
      Audio= None<br />
      Size= 320 X 240 Windowed<br />
      Windowed performance= Max<br />
      FPS= 22.2 Overlay= Off<br />
      FPS= 19.8 Overlay= On Set desktop color= off<br />
      FPS= 19.4 Overlay= On Set desktop color= on<br />
      All other check boxes= Off<br />
      <br />
      Size= 640 X 480 Windowed<br />
      Windowed performance= Max<br />
      FPS= 10.5 Overlay= Off<br />
      FPS= 8.8 Overlay= On Set desktop color= off<br />
      FPS= 8.1 Overlay= On Set desktop color= on<br />
      All other check boxes= Off<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      OS= Win98 with 98lite<br />
      CPU= Celeron1 366@550 5.5X100<br />
      Chipset= BX440<br />
      VideoCard= Matrox G450 32MBDDR Dual head, Overlay active<br />
      <br />
      This is an example, the numbers are correct, but just a sample.:D<br />
      <br />
      It is interesting to note that while to # of pixels quadrupled the FPS only decreased by around 45%, not to &gt;25% as one might think.<br />
      BTW UnConeD I love your work!</p>

      some avs doesn't do anything without music<br />
      so don't say that avs is independent</p>

      <p class="post-content">Indeed... I believe some AVS effects are optimzed so that they won't do anything useless. So blurring a completely black image (or partially) will be faster than blurring a regular one. You could always use the tone generator or something :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with you noizze. But wouldn't it be easier just to benchmark the CPU of your computer seeing that AVS only uses the CPU?</p>
