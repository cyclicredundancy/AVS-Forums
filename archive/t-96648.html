      tuggummi is really good. I've got a bunch of his pre-sets, and wow. El-vis is good to, but it's missing something. I don't know, but if there is anything better, or as good tell me.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>let's not forget the pioneers &amp; others</strong><br />
      Sure maybe some of the presets by the artists I'm about to mention are slightly out of date &amp; not quite as cool as the coolest stuff released by some other AVS artists, but these ones deserve recognition too for all they've contributed to the community. Let's not forget Zen-X, Tonic...and especially ParaNoya...not sure if anyone mentioned Marco-but he helped with the AVS Society packs as well. Oh yeah, if nobody's mentioned Tuomas, he deserves credit as well for his work on the AVS Society packs. All these AVS artists talents added a lot of quality to AVS Society.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure that I'm forgetting lots of great AVS artists. The list goes on &amp; on.</p>
