      Okay, this here would be my first releaseable AVS.<br />
      <br />
      As I say right in the comment, I am a newb, I haven't made releasables before. Please, do not flame me, I'm after some constructive criticism and most likely some help coding them in the future.<br />
      <br />
      Also, when ever I release anything on the interweb, I use my old band name of $nickahz, regardless of what my user name is, so you want to look for that when you DL it. (When is read, IF)<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, Please don't flame.<br />

      <p class="post-content">well, can't really say it's good, and i probably seen this type of preset in many shapes and sizes but it's decent.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Standard beginner stuff i'd say, can't really say too much good about it, but i won't be rude either. Read some tutorials and play around with AVS more, some people also recommend breaking down other people's presets to learn how they did it, but for me personally that has never worked.<br />
      <br />
      First you fail, then you try, try, try again! :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow, I am surprised I haven't hit a bunch of flames yet! Thanks it's really appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      My problem is that the tutorials don't really give examples of what's actually going on for the proceedures called, else, I'd be reading more and more of them.<br />
      <br />
      It looks very similar to C++ however...*Blows some dust of a couple of books*<br />
      <br />
      Anywhoo, thanks for the insight.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You should try to make it more interesting to look at.<br />
