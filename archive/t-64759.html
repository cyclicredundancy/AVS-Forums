			<strong>Beat detection?</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Can anyone explain the options under beat detection please.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is I'm having some problems with dynamic movement, below is an example pre-set I'm having trouble with. The problem is if AVS is not picking up any beats the dynamic movement doesn't kick in, leaving the display static. I'm playing drum and base CDs, so there are enough beats being pumped out but AVS is not picking them up.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to know what FPS this pre-set runs at on other peoples PCs, I only get 5 - 10 FPS, with the window stretched to cover the whole screen (1024/768), I can't run in full screen, it crashes windows if I try. I have a PII 333 MMX with NVIDIA RIVA TNT 16MB<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

		I've noticed that if winamp gets CDBD info from the net beat detection seems to work well, what's the connection?<br />

			<strong>Hmm...</strong><br />
		
		

		I am having the same problem. It seems the beats from CD's don't do anything with ANY vis. If you press Control+k, then click INPUT on the left menu, select Nulsoft CD/Linein plug-in v1.71 to the left of the menu, and click configure, it says <br />
 
	<blockquote>
			
				(note: be sure to set up your soundcard sampling input to the correct input source in order to have visualtaion)</blockquote>
But I don't know how to do this. Any help?

		Thanks sawg, it worked! I'm just wondering if you read my post before you did yours, or did you just read the first post and posted the answer. I'm asking because you posted about 2 minutes later.:)

		Dutchie,<br />
<br />
Good luck getting beat detection to work with Drum &amp; Bass songs.  It's only a computer, after all, and given the irregular rithms of most D&amp;B, it has a hard time calculating any beat detection.  I would think you might have a better time if you turned off &quot;Auto-Keep&quot; for such tracks -- this will prevent the Beat detection from locking on an incorrect beat.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, house tunes, with its straight 4/4 beat, often enable quick and accurate beat detection.  Auto-keep is ideal for these tunes, as the beat it zeroes in on will more-than-likely be correct.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
