<div class="posttext">Wasn't too happy with the matrix visualizations available for AVS so I made one. Came out pretty nice for my first AVS. The font isn't mine, I donloaded it off the web. The font (and the accompaning readme) are included but you still gotta install them seperately.<br />
<br />
Here it is (http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~co097871/reloaded.zip) <br />
<br />
All comments and critiques are welcome, I realize I'm a n00b and have a lot to learn.<br />

<div class="posttext">Toooo slow and too many fx lists used and kinda buggy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That actually pretty incredible for a noob preset. Ishan is right though. Too slow, and you could probably loose a few effect lists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for advice, I knew it was pretty slow but I liked it too much to cut back before :), I got rid of the most exspensive onBeat effect, one of the streams of text, and some of the background text. It's alot faster now but still pretty slow! I updated the zip file, the new and improved preset is called reloaded2. Do you guys have any other tips to speed it up? maybe faster ways to get the same general effects done? And what do you mean by buggy Ishan? Are you refering to how the vertical text stretches when you run at higher resolutions? Any tips on how to fix that too? <br />
<br />
Keep the comments coming!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Remove the DDM, it just looks so, so noobish, and the onbeat clears, they just anno me for some reason. The text looks awesome, nice work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The DDM *is* gone. Reloaded2.avs is the updated preset, reloaded.avs is the old one left in the zip file for comparison. Maybe that was confusing. I'll re-upload the zip with ONLY the new file from now on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another quick update. Got the background text in there just by fudgin' with blending modes which looks a lot better. I moved grain and blur outta an effect list and I also toned down the onbeat clears but they're still there. Any better?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">still too slow for me, i get 7 fps at 400x300.<br />
and woodwizzle , by buggy i mean the bug in the render/text which fills the blue colorchannel when used additive blend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Woodwizzle</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th June 2003, 06:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ahh, i don't seem to get that but:) And I get about 20fps at 400x300... I just changed all the additive's to replace. Does that fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th June 2003, 06:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i guess so....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">WHOOPS! I think I was uploading my zip file to the wrong directory. My Bad. I fixed it though. Should be considerably faster than the last version that was up there. *doh!*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You don't have to put the font in the fonts folder - it doesn't even let me put it there on my computer.  If you put it in the avs folder (like everything else), it will work there.  <br />
<br />
If you took out all of the effect lists that have just text in them, it will be the same image except exceedingly faster.  This is because you have copied the same text repeatedly and it won't be any different because they will be in the same spot, just overlapping each other.  And the matrix screen it supposed to have a black background, does it not?  UnConeD mentioned this problem in his matrix preset from the first Whacko pack.<br />
<br />
He tells you how to avoid this in the following comment:<br />
<br />
there's the falling letters effect. This should've been a lot easier if it weren't for a weird bug in the text-renderer that causes the blue-colorchannel to be filled slightly. Very annoying if you want to do additive texts. The workaround is to cut away the blue channel and then clip all yellow to white again. <br />
<br />
And if that makes no sense (which I had to research to figure out as well), what he did to fix that was:<br />
<br />
1.  In an additive effect list, he put in the text.<br />
<br />
2.  Directly below the text he adds a dynamic shift, which expands the text into multiple rows other than just one.<br />
<br />
3.  Outside the effect list now, he adds a brightness filter with the blue colorchannel set to 0.  Blending is set to replace.<br />
<br />
4.  Added a color clip from yellow to white, but I took it out and there wasn't any difference.  I restarted the preset, and still no difference.  So step four wasn't necessary  <br />
<br />
OMG - UnConeD made a mistake in AVS?!? Oh well, he's only human.  And it was his first pack.:) <br />
<br />
I hope that works for you.</div></div><hr />
