<div class="posttext">Hi ! <br />
I just made an improved AVI renderer for AVS featuring:<br />
<br />
- better stability (no more crash when changing files without disabling rendering)<br />
- better speed control, with frames skipping<br />
- pause &amp; reset video buttons<br />
- luma &amp; chroma keying<br />
<br />
http://goebish.free.fr/vfx/aviplayer.jpg<br />
<br />
Controls should be self explanary,<br />
Chroma keying is far from being perfect but it works<br />
pretty well for what I do with it :) <br />
<br />
Get this new APE at: http://goebish.free.fr/vfx</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice ape.<br />
never realy used avis in my presets or anywhere:). might i ask whats wrong with Pixelplayer ape? it seems to work fast and somewhat stable. Havent tryed to work with it myself and it prolly woldnt be a good thing to use with hotlist because they both need lots of ram.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw why doesnt playlister work with the new avs:/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Pixelplayer APE require ram because it decompress entire video stream into memory for fast frames access, allowing reverse playing with non/poor keyed video file and other things. <br />
Mine doesn't, but they don't have the same application (both are for live performance anyway).<br />
<br />
Magic's Hotlist (hi mate!) doesn't take so much memory, it just preload presets's snapshots, that's not so much.<br />
<br />
Playlister works very well with newer Winamp/AVS, just use classic style instead of modern, only resizing of render window don't work.</div></div><hr />

it does if you have a lot of them:)<br />

<br />
I read it in the help file, and because i cant get it to work i thought this was the reason. It crashes when i want to add a preset to the playlist. Any ideas why?<br />
<br />
ps: i know this is a bit offtopic but since you are probably goning to read this thread again i thought i'd ask here:)</div></div><hr />

I just made it work without problem. Does it give you an error number/message so I can try to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok when i first run it after install it sais:<br />
<br />
erreurd'execution '97':<br />
<br />
impossible d'appeler une function aime sur un objet qui n'est pas une instance de classe de definition<br />
<br />
after that it shuts down and when i run it again, and add a preset it just crashes without any error messages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The first error after install is normal (well, this is a bug coz the .ini isn't here yet).<br />
I've no idea about your crash and the problem is that this is a 2 years old crappy VB program.<br />
If enough peoples get interested maybe I can try to remake it using C/C++</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">fsk</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th December 2004, 08:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that probably will not happen, so i gues this will die just like hotlist did:/.<br />
<br />
thx anyway:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I tested it on some computers (98/2K/XPsp1) while the week and I had no problem. Probably your problem is due to a dll-hell as I compiled it with a french edition of visual basic. If you have a VB6 compiler I can send you source code so that you can compile it by yourself and maybe solve your issue (pm me,I'll do my best to help you).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice ape, but why an own menu for that ape? shouldnt it be in the 'Render' menu?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">from the AVS Wishlist:<br />
Render / AVI: Ability to provide code to define playback speed (or current frame)<br />
<br />
You could implement that in your AVI player :)<br />
setting the current frame might be hard though as you said your APE streams the AVIs instead of pre-loading them<br />
<br />
What about implementing the remaining blend modes? (by adding an option &quot;Default renderer blend mode&quot;, like Render/Clear Screen has)<br />
I can give you fast MMX code for all of the blend modes, especially for maximum/minimum blending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">goebish</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th January 2005, 09:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Can I access (at least read) global registers from inside my APE ?<br />
How do I retrieve default renderer blend mode ?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st January 2005, 02:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yes you can<br />
if you didnt find out how yet, you prolly have an old SDK<br />
get the new one here:<br />
http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/wa502_sdk.zip<br />
you can also make codable components with it<br />
read the avs_ape.h file and you'll find out everything you need<br />
further questions: post here or pm me :)<br />
<br />
btw: don't use the blend functions in that header. they're about the slowest thing possible to do the job :) PM me if you want MMX blend functions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">goebish</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st January 2005, 09:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't know there was a new ape SDK version. I'm just looking at it, thanks :)<br />
My code use these BLEND &amp; BLEND_AVG functions, there're not so slow (but I use MMX asm for adjustable blend).<br />
I'll try to implement missing render modes soon, I'll ask you if i've problem with it. Don't really know when I'll have time because I start my new job tomorrow, so maybe one of those week end :)<br />
Is there an sample code for a codable component somewhere (so I can make x,y,w,h,speed &amp; frameskip codable) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd February 2005, 09:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i'm afraid there's no sample code anywhere...<br />
you get a VM context handle with the &quot;allocVM&quot; function.<br />
you should do this once per instance, so that every instance has its own variables and things like that.<br />
the next thing you do (also once per instance) is registering variables. you might find this macro useful :) (modify to fit your variable name for the VM context)<br />
<br />
#define regvar(varname, initval) *(VMV_##varname = g_extinfo-&gt;regVMvariable(vmcontext, #varname)) = initval;<br />
<br />
it registers a variable with the given name and initialises it to the given initvalue<br />
example: regvar(w, (double)w);<br />
you need to declare this variable somewhere (preferably in the class definition)<br />
double *VMV_w;<br />
<br />
after you have completed these steps, you can compile code with the &quot;compileVMcode&quot; function. This function takes a VM context and a piece of code as parameters and returns a VM code handle.<br />
you can then execute the code with the &quot;executeCode&quot; function.<br />
when you're done, don't forget to free the code, using the &quot;freeCode&quot; function, and the VM, using the &quot;freeVM&quot; function.<br />
<br />
btw about that mmx stuff:<br />
i have maximum blending in 2 MMX ops per 2 pixels and minimum blending in 3 MMX ops per 2 pixels (not including loading the mmx registers and storing the data back)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">goebish</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd February 2005, 17:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank for your answer, I'll try to play with this VM.<br />
I'm interested by your MMX routines but I need per pixel (not 2) because of keying as I don't render every pixels.<br />
I need a function like: <br />
static unsigned int inline minblend(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd February 2005, 03:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">static unsigned int inline maxblend(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {<br />
    unsigned int tmp;<br />
    __asm {<br />
        movd    mm0, a<br />
        movd    mm1, b<br />
        PSUBUSB mm0, mm1<br />
        PADDB   mm0, mm1<br />
        movd    tmp, mm0<br />
    }<br />
    return tmp;<br />
}<br />
static unsigned int inline minblend(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {<br />
    unsigned int tmp;<br />
    __asm {<br />
        movd    mm0, a<br />
        movd    mm1, b<br />
        MOVQ    mm2, mm0<br />
        PSUBUSB mm2, mm1<br />
        PSUBUSB mm0, mm2<br />
        movd    tmp, mm0<br />
    }<br />
    return tmp;<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
don't forget &quot;__asm emms&quot; after you're done, or every floating point operation after that will fail (AVS code contains lots of floating point operations)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You man are really great :)<br />
As I said before I've not too much time now but I'll implement that one of these week end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">btw you should really think about doing the whole filtering (including keying) in MMX asm... i'm sure there's a lot of speed to gain this way</div></div><hr />
