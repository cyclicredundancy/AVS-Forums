<div class="posttext">Well as looking in other peoples presets I notice variables that I can't recall what they exactly mean.  Any help would be great, but if none is given that is fine as well.  <br />
In the trans movement I have seen a t variable use.  t stands for?<br />
<br />
Superscope I see a lot of unknown variables.  I also haven't done math for many years now so I may be a bit rusty.  I see the t variable in this one as well.  Are the g, b, r, variables short for green, blue, and red?  I also see the s variable being used.  s stands for?  <br />
<br />
Dynamic movement are the variables the same meaning as in other trans options?  I see a c, f, m variables.  I can make some guesses or maybe I will have to just mess around and figure them out on my own, but some simple answer can also be an added help.  <br />
<br />
Or maybe if the same variables mean the same thing, a run down of the variables would be awesome.  I know many people are confused with these mathematical equations.  I don't have the knowledge of all the functions, but if I did and got up my webpage making skills I would love to create a site for all new users, but since I'm not at that level I ask the high end creators to share some info.  <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">These are all variables meaningless to AVS itself, but used for other stuff.  You can have almost any variable you want.  &quot;monkey&quot; could be a variable.  &quot;thechickenthatattackedyourhousewithaflamethrower&quot; could also be a variable. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">superscope default variables:<br />
x and y (duh) -1&lt;x or y&lt;1<br />
i point on waveform/spectrum, 0&lt;i&lt;1<br />
v value at i, -1&lt;i&lt;1<br />
w,h width and height of renderer in pixels<br />
red, green, blue 0&lt;variable&lt;1<br />
n is how many samples per waveform<br />
b is 1 if there is currently a beat, 0 otherwise<br />
anything else is custom, sometimes people like to save pi to a variable, there are intermediate variables (say for making something be a certain color for more than one frame...)<br />
in movement r is theta and d is... um... I haven't figured that out yet, because when you ADD to d, things move IN! I guess it's 1 minus the distance from the center... someone care to verify this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">D is distance of course, but remember that you specify the *source* pixel for a given pixel.<br />
<br />
If you're given r=0, d=0.5 and you say d=d+0.1, then it means that the pixel at d=0.5 will get the color that's currently at d=0.6... moving inward :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you would think that that would move the pixel at 0.5 to 0.6 though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whoa, that looks like an excellent paper! Wish I had this when writing mine :)... it works ok, but I haven't really tested it for randomness.<br />
<br />
By the way, here's an explanation of | &amp;:<br />
<br />
- (a|b) converts a and b to integers and performs a binary OR on them (any bit that is 1 in either a OR b, is 1 in the result).<br />
- (a&amp;b) converts a and b to integers and performs a binary AND on them (any bit that is 1 in both a AND b, is 1 in the result).<br />
<br />
% is the modulus operator. (a%b) calculates the remainder after dividing a by b (both operators are converted to integers first). For example:<br />
<br />
14/3 = 4 + 2/3<br />
So, 14 % 3 = 2.<br />
<br />
28/5 = 5 + 3/5<br />
So, 28 % 5 = 3<br />
<br />
The modulus operator is useful 'wrapping' numbers inside an interval. For example, the value (a % 4) for a ranging from 0 to positive infinity, is always 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no fair, my brain hurts, and im nowhere besides what d does (though i cant figure out how to use it):cry: <br />

maybe its not good to study this at 1 in the morining</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">there are many AVS-ready variables or variable types that I have noticed in others' works.  Such as R01, R02, ..., R50 - Which are 'universal' variables that may be referenced from one superscope after being set in another.  Also I seen things like skip, linesize, etc....<br />
<br />
If anyone has any extensive knowlege of these and/or more, that would be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Such as R01, R02, ..., R50 - Which are 'universal' variables...&quot; Uh, no. The universal variables are reg##,andalso vavailiablefor your syncing needs is gmegabuf(). Skip is a ssc variable that  over 0, does not draw the line/dotcurrently being compueted. Linesize is a SSC variable that only works when the SSC it set to lines. It sets the &lt;b&gt; Line Size&lt;/b&gt; of the current point with a cap at 225. Come on, that one was obvious</div></div><hr />
