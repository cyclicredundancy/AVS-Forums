      <p class="post-content"><strong>new graphics card and I'm so happy</strong><br />
      I just installed a new "geforce2" card.<br />
      now my mother bord tries to keep up with winamp instead of the other way around. I'm sure it's no big deal to you guys.but I realized how crapy the presets I made are to the rest of you.<br />
      <br />
      I know I said this before but I'm so happy. Like a kid in a candy store.<br />
      <br />
      I just played 2 games that wouldn't play before because I went from 4 meg to 64 on the vid card.<br />
      <br />
      I have a few 100 of ya'lls presets that might as well be bran new.<br />

      <p class="post-content">you know that the video card doesn't make a huge impact on AVS - actually it barely makes an impact at all.<br />
      <br />
      And it isn't your motherboard that is trying to keep up, but your CPU.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I get what your saying, but I saw Elivs and jeriko double in frame rate. I guess i should have said my 503 Mhz chip is trying to keep up. well any avs now matches the beat. but the keybord input form me is slower.yes' I understand My cpu is a piece of **** but.I got the most tweaked 500Mhz. - machine out there.</p>

Don't think the AVS's I made till now on my Pentium 266 will still look nice on it, is going to be a speedburst from here (holland) to Tokyo, finally able to do something more with AVS :), now I only have to wait (and work damn hard for it ;)).</p>

      <p class="post-content">sounds good. i hope to get a new computer soon as well. i think i will go with the 2.4GHZ pentium 4 with hyperthreading and hopefully i will be able to get the new geforceFX 5900 with 256MB. now if AVS is still slow with that i don't know what it will take for that to run smoothly at fullscreen</p>

      <p class="post-content">The geforceFX 5900 ultra? :) yay, that's the fastest card on the market now. (though also the loudest, and therefor I suggest you still take the ATI Radeon 9800+ if you want a silent computer. The performance drop is almost nothing (just a tiny bit of 3d mark score, in the games you won't even notice), and the noice level is really a lot lower, which makes it a recommendable buy.)<br />
      <br />
      just my two cents :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">that is true Deamon the gefoceFX 5900 will definetly be the top graphics card for very long sense it is just a few more point better than the raedeon but its just my preference i just like to be different instead of everybody else getting the ATI card and the AMD chips i just like to take a little risk now and then and besides the 5900 and raedeon are just about the same price around where i am anyway</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>update -It keep's geting cooler</strong><br />
      tonight I thought what the hell.I hooked up an old monitor from my 486 and even though the duel screen support lowered the res. on my second screen to 600x800.the avs played just as fast on both monitors.<br />
      maybe the graphics memory on the gforce2 bleed into the crappy ati pro(4meg)or maybe not whatever.all I know is 2 screens take longer to screw with but I can change the avs on the little monitor while waiting it on the other in full screen. oh and yes I went though hell adjusting everything.</p>

      <p class="post-content">saw a display at my local computer store playing avs (god this thing gets around!) on a computer which had 6 flat screan monitors all hooked up. What was cool was<br />
      <br />
      a) That fullscrean render was spread out across the 6 monitors.<br />
      b) It was insanely fast (getting on for 40 FPS @ 1024x1168)!<br />
      c) They were playing el-vis. (I think it was golden, but i'm not sure.)<br />
      <br />
      It turned out that the pc was a alienware pentium 4 3ghz, with a geforce Fx 9700. awesome!</p>

      <br />
      I'm now thinking that the FPS limiter thing may be a good APE to have. Zero-G Maze III gets over 70FPS at 320x200. You can barely see it turning. It turns almost 2 times a second. It's way too damn fast. At 800x600(No pixel doubling) it runs at a reasonable(but somewhat slow) 21FPS.</p>

      </blockquote>I do agree completely with you! ;)<br />
      <br />
      Firstly, AVS is indeed one of the most fascinating apps I have ever come across (it helps to be a programmer with a strong interest in electronic music!).<br />
      <br />
      I run AVS 2.6 at 384x285 on my P3-866 (128Mb SDRAM) at work and get around 20fps, which is bearable. We have an 1GHz Athlon (512Mb SDRAM) at home which does about 50% better. Then I got myself a gaming machine 3 months ago: XP 2100+, 512Mb DDR-333, 128Mb Radeon 9500 Pro. :cool: now I get the same frame rate when running fullscreen at 800 x 600 x 32bpp (80% screen height).<br />
      <br />
      I think it would be <b>so</b> amazing if it were possible to have software and hardware-rendering. This would push the complexity up quite a large bit though: using an API like OpenGL or Direct3D, plus somehow ensuring that the presets could safely be switched between software and hardware.

      <p class="post-content">Most of the effects, avs uses may not be done with 3d hardware. And those who could, will probably never as it's unlikely that there will be a really innovative update to avs.<br />
      <br />
      But if you want, you could write ape's that use 3d hardware to render something.<br />

      <blockquote>
        Because a framerate limiter can be passed with the preset is much smarter then a comment saying "best to watch at xx.xfps"
      </blockquote>Yes, but i was referring to Anubis's "problems" of the avs's being too fast <b>for him</b>. Yes the framerate limiter could help people like Degnic, who is always yapping about the framerate O_o , but still i don't think it would be such a great ape. If you need make effects that are dependable on some certain framerate... well booh on you then :p<br />
      <br />
      And yes i yap about the framerate too, but my policy always is "The faster, the better" and no framerate <b>limiter</b> can help there :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      And anubis, just use a bigger window or use wa3, that should do the trick ;)

      <p class="post-content">lol @ point 7 &amp; 8. I do that already. It's great to have a girlfriend, they force you to care about real life. How about that 2 in 1 ;). Oh well, good luck. :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't need a GF to force me to care about RL, but it does help ;). I do a lot in RL without my girlfriend with it, like sports etc, so I'm capable of living a real life as well. Woohoo! I'm multi-talented :D. What I do with my girlfriend is private, so don't bother asking.</p>
