<div class="posttext">looks like any other low budget video.. from 1994. no wait, they looked better (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCKLdNWn_so&amp;feature=related) back then ;) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks! I did it with no budget! Actually I went into the red buying a new hard drive and more ram so I could record the AVS in better quality and without skipping. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like the the guy's voice a lot, great music.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering why in El-Vis' preset (5.06) (Sentinel, I believe) it stops analyzing the sound.<br />
<br />
Other than that, great work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">aww man you couldn't think that seriously! tresholded overfiltered amateur gogo girls aren't cool anymore! and the whole thing hasn't got a definable style. the beginning has no logical connection with the remaining part (and too sterile for that fallout mood) that border around the whole video is just ugly and i hate when this type of music is mixed with this sterile Ã¼berelectronic-ish stuff (it would require at least one shouting mouth in a mic without any eyecandy-fancy effects).<br />
btw avs 99.9% powered by just the cpu so i hope your new hdd and ram have had dramatic effects on the performance!:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Your absolutely right micro.D   and Yathosho itâ€™s an atomic mess. And thanks for your kind words wotl. I agree with your assessments. <br />
<br />
It could have been better. The HD quality I was going for is not even close. The siren audio breaks up. Itâ€™s way too long.  As far as El-Vis' presetâ€¦.I am recording the AVS in sync with music. But that one I didnâ€™t get right and I was too lazy to fix it. That was a major mistake not fixing that. I was just impatient and lazy. I took it down and put it to side till I work out all the kinks. <br />
<br />
Thank-you guys for your honest and constructive input. Itâ€™s been a big help. Now that Iâ€™ve  been brought back down to earth. Itâ€™s back to work on my next video. With lessons learned. The cool thing is I just download a couple AVS archives to check out. I donâ€™t know how many presets I have nowâ€¦..but itâ€™s a sh*t load. <br />
<br />
 I for one can appreciate all the TIME, EFFORT, SKILLS and PATIENTS that goes in to making presets. (I  know because I tried. â€œI want to learnâ€) One of my goals with that video was to show how cool AVS visuals are. (didnâ€™t quite achieve that)  Some of the coolest effects  ever. <br />
<br />
 Thanks for your hard work!</div></div><hr />
