			<strong>A quick remix request</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Well since everybody seemed to make remixes out of the worm-o-rama preset, i thought that why not ask for more remixes :D<br />
<br />
The timeline though is very short, what im asking from you is to make remixes for <b>next tuesday</b> 15:00 (gmt +2 hours). The reason for this is that im publishing &quot;Breaking Myself&quot; just before my summer holiday starts and after that i won't be around for 8 weeks...<br />
<br />
So here are a couple of presets (i didn't pick the best ;)) from my next pack which you can remix for me hopefully :)<br />
<br />
<br />
So get your ass moving! :blah: :D

		I thought Weird Blobs was the easiest to remix (well, second to Worm-O-Rama, but already remixed), and the others are pretty difficult - but apparently, most people remix Piknik...

		Thanks everyone :) It's not deadline yet for... *looks at clock* 5 hours, but i just wanted to say a couple of things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skupers: I have to rename the file to &quot;Tuggummi - ## - skupers...&quot; Because of the ordering, i hope you're ok with that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ishan Rocky: Could you do the remix without the Dynamic Clear Screen? I won't include another extra APE just for one preset... It really grows the overall filesize and is incovenient for me :p You could just use a superscope &amp; movement to do a DCS and i wouldn't have to include any more APE's.

		Shreays, well all, i don't want to reject any, but i will if you use some weird apes that i don't even have :igor: Like &quot;Add on borders&quot; (doesn't any one of you know that you can do that with a superscope or with a sourcemapped zoom movement? :igor: ) Or Dynamc Clear Screen which can be done with a superscope &amp; a movement + there is much more control in doing it with those.
