<div class="posttext">You probably all saw the M&amp;M's commercials with the rippling mass of M&amp;M's...I decided to recreate it in AVS :) <br />
<br />
I used most of UnConeD's Seismogrid preset and changed it around a bit...changed the BMP to that of an M&amp;M and it works okay...it still has some dimensional problems though...<br />
<br />
The images stay in the same order when they turn..so the one which should be in the back is in the front...it has rough edges....and it looks a bit screwy...<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anybody wanted to play around with it and maybe lead me in the right path of how I should go about finishing this preset? Keep in mind that I'm only a 14 year old with a basic understanding of how linear equations work etc...but I know how to effectively use them when I see the results right away in AVS. I think I've taken on a bit too big of a project for what I know...<br />
<br />
If anybody has any ideas or comments, let me know...keep in mind this is only a rough draft. Any ideas on how to make the order of the images smoothly shift as it turns? should it not turn at all and just stay as it is?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, doesn't look like you did much to it, but not that i checked the code wouldn't understand a thing anyway :p<br />
Also something in your zip filename screwed up the attachment and you need to rename the file after you download it. Also i was missing the texer bitmap you are using.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Whoops...I forgot the BMP...It's attached to this post :)<br />
<br />
I did some resizing and a little bit here and there...I didn't do too much with the actual coding itself...it's still a rough draft...<br />
<br />
Could you check it out and see if there's any way to make the images change order as everything rotates? or atleast is in the opposite order... because if you take the camera code scope out it's in the wrong order and it could just not rotate and just sit there and be fine  :)</div></div><hr />

the actually reason should be the apostrophe, you can't have backslashes in windows filenames :p<br />
<br />
guess the board produces the name. however, i don't (http://www.getfirefox.com) have problems downloading these</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice idea... you need to z-sort that however :)<br />
<br />
another way would be using max blending and some distance shading like i did in the attached preset</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">This Way Out</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th July 2004, 05:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That looks nice :)<br />
<br />
Is there any way to do that with a white background? The commercials had a white background and I'm trying to imitate that. Also, in the commercial, each new ripple started it's own color, and the color spread with the outer edge of the ripple. Is there any way to add that into this preset? I know that's a bit complex, but it's just another idea that could be incorporated into this preset eventually.<br />
<br />
What's z-sorting? I'm confused. Would  that be like adding a z axis and having them automatically resort themselves as the camera turns?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">colorclip:<br />
mode=near(slider to the left)<br />
color=black<br />
replacement color=white<br />
or you draw the whole thing with min blending and other color blending...<br />
doing that now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
done...<br />
a bit different than i wrote but it works :)<br />
it's still max blending but i inverted the bitmap and made its background black after that.<br />
then i moved that trans/invert to the end of the preset and activated it</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the help with this, I appreciate it. I'm making an AVS pack currently...would it be okay if I used what you've done in it? I'd include a message noting your work and everything...<br />
<br />
I'll finish it up, modify it bit, and make it to my liking before I put the final draft into my pack.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">np... just promise to learn at least the use of mspaint ;)<br />
that bitmap was quite unclean at first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">This Way Out</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th July 2004, 01:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I used photoshop 7.0's magic wand tool to do that...that's why it was unclean... <br />
<br />
I shoulda used a circular cropping tool...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you should've used mspaint for that small .bmp :)<br />
it's excellent for such cleanup work</div></div><hr />
