		I'd thought I post this in a new topic to keep it clearer. avsapes.tk is up! With 1 Ape! The site is extremly simple, partly to keep it quick for dialup, and partly due to my crap HTML knowledge. But now that it's up, it should make it easier requesting APES. As far as I am concerened, there are 6 guys I need to ask:<br />
<br />
Tom Holden<br />
UnConeD<br />
Sheyras Pontis<br />
Goebish<br />
Ryan Geiss<br />
Tomy Lobo<br />
<br />
I'm about to email UnConeD now, check back later for more news.<br />
<br />
/edit - just emailed UnConeD

		Meh. I don't care. Anyway, UnConeD refused permission to put his APE's up, and as this is gonna be a real bitch of a job to complete as I don't have a home internet connection, and doing the honorable/lazy thing and giving up. If any one wants the domain name, they can have it.

		I really didn't see the point in this whole thing and im glad no more effort is wasted on this. Why? Simply because every useful &amp; meaningful ape is already included in the default install! All the other apes are too exotic (ijen, now how many exactly uses it again?), too stupid (render3D, riight, so you add a spinning 3D object from 3Dmax you have no control over whatsoever...) or the effect can be achieved via avs measures easily (*cough*addborders*cough*dynamicclearscreen*cough*)

		Harsh but true.<br />
<br />
Although i disagree that there are still some APE's that would be useful, ...text2.ape ....autosave.ape<br />
<br />
[edit] sorry that didnt really make any sense, what I meant was...

		Pak, yup, but those don't exist yet ;)<br />
And when/if they do im sure they will be so popular you can easily find them without even trying to search them.

		mysterious: why dont you just link the DL sites for the APEs?<br />
would be more convenient for authors and for you ;)<br />
[edit]<br />
oh you want to put up one of my APEs?<br />
hmm that probably means APEresize.ape<br />
you can link to it here:<br />
