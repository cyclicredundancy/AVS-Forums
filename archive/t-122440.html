<div class="posttext">This is what I want to see:<br />
<br />
Something where I can pre-render an AVS with a song of my choice and at a resolution of my choice.  Then save to whole thing to a avi.  This pre-renderer would allow a more accurate calculation of the AVS due to not being in real-time.<br />
<br />
I've already seen ape's where you can save an AVS to an avi, but they take the data as the avs outputs it.  I want to see some of these avs's at a nice high res with a smooth frame rate, but it cannot be done without losing render quality because of the limiting of detail when the frame rate is low.<br />
<br />
Whatever though...  anyone get what i'm saying?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only thing I can think of is to record it at high resolution using one of the APE's and then using a video editor to skip the empty space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way you can do that is with a computer faster than any processor within 3 years... Synchronization is barely possible, and the rest goes to Nullsoft.<br />
<br />
If you want good smooth picture (conjecture!), use AVSGrabber with synchro on, and reduce movement speeds (Ya know, the rand(blabla) thing), just enough to accomodate the higher framrate wanted. Even then, it will have as much music detection as a nearly deaf person.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Look Alex, this isn't our job. We help people on the forums because we want to and in repayment for others helping us(at least these are my reasons).  If I was being payed I would do it, but since I too am lazy and am not making money, I will only tell you to search the forums.  You will not recieve any help from me(or from most of us in the forums) unless you first try to find out the answer for yourself.<br />

<div class="posttext">First: Did you really expect me to think that you would actually go and find something for me?  Yeah right...<br />
<br />
Nic01, no...  I don't think you get it.  I don't want to record an avi of an avs that is playing along with a song in real-time, I want an avi of an avs that is rendered to a song.  When you attempt to run a High-Res avs in real-time, the avs's quality is brought down to keep the frame rate up.  When you render the avs in the manner I am talking about, you are allowing the computer to take time to calculate what is happening in each frame.  Now I know this would take more time to render, but speed is not point.  The point is to create a High-Res avi of an avs to be used for something like a music video.<br />
<br />
Discussing the attitude of users that is common in most larger forums:<br />
I just don't understand this whole thing with forums where there's always these few people who just hang around all the time and repeat the rules / regulations.  (Ex. Board Junkies Atero and anubis2003 - you guys show up in almost every thread)  This is what makes the forum enviroment so less desirable.  I don't care if you're helping to enforce the forum rules, what you people do is quite repetitive and annoying.<br />
<br />
This isn't a real bulletin board - It's not going to fill up.  I think there is enough space for repeat questions.  And if you think it is unnecessary to have to repeat the same answer over and over again, then simply don't respond to the post.  It's not like it is going to KILL YOU to be inactive in a single thread.<br />

<br />
Is it just me, or does this defeat the purpose of a forum entirely?  I thought that this whole board is here so people can ask questions and get answers.  I guess it's just sort of a RTFM thing now a days...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you want to make it go like that, go make a separate plugin, designed to the preset you need, optimized to hell. If you want to make it go that way, you'll have to also control Winamp - Plugins can't do that...<br />
<br />
So there's just about 3 solutions now - Don't bother, Make your own plugin, or use a wholly different program altogether.<br />
<br />
As for the 2-AVS-forum-junkies problem : You're not on the side bombarded with questions asked for hundreds of times before. Ask any other webmasters/forum elites of popular sites. People can just pm the user the rules/faq thingy and just delete the thread, but guess what... Rovastar's the only dedicated mod here, and us forum regulars don't have such power.<br />
<br />
Get along with it or get along a cliff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The purpose of this forum is to provide people with help on a specific topic and act as a resource for finding help.  If the topic question has already been answered, then it should not be asked again.  All this does is use more space(which could eventually lead to nullsoft charging money for winamp - this is unlikely though) and make it harder for someone to find help on a specific topic.  And you can't call me a forum junkie(yet) as I've been in the forums in less than a month.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well this is a wishlist and my idea is a something I wish to see.  I'm not telling anyone to go and make this, just sharing an idea.<br />
<br />
No where do I see anything stating that you, as a regular, have to read repeat posts.  Now I can see that you might not know at first that it is going to be repeat, but once you do all it takes is hitting back...  If you think it is a waste of time to be reading repeat posts, they why waste time responding?  But I guess if you want, you can waste your precious time repeating the same answers over and over again.</div></div><hr />

Less than a month and you're already a senior member....  wow...  And people think that I'm wasting my life by sitting in front of a computer all the time.  They obviously don't know about the type that spends all day on a single websites forum.  To top if off, you'd acutally be proud to be know as a &quot;Forum Junkie&quot;.  &quot;So what do you do in your free time?  Well I spend it all on the WINAMP forums.&quot;  Yeah, that is going to get you far in life.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First off, I am not proud to be known as a forum junkie, which is why I retaliated against the statement.  And writing in these forums doesn't take that much time; most of my posts take less than a minute to write.  And since I've been grounded from leaving the house for most of the last month, I don't have much else to do except surf the net.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Switching to personal attacks because nothing else can be said is pretty lame.<br />
<br />
anubis quoted a piece I posted in another thread, which will probably make me sound like a total jerk. That's your right, but don't judge me from a simple piece of text. The people here know me as a friendly guy who helps out a lot: I'm the one who spent time collecting Frequently Asked Questions (main forum), and collected all the wishes into the Wishlist-sticky.<br />
<br />
And then, after you've done all that, some idiot comes along and pops his/her question, the answer of which can be read in the FAQ, or found by searching the forums. It's clear these people have no other idea in there head than &quot;I've got a problem, help me, help me.&quot; As soon as they see the 'post a topic' button, *poof* they start typing and wait for an answer suited personally for them.<br />
<br />
This crybaby helpless attitude makes me sick, for the simple reason that it reduces this vibrant community of AVS enthusiasts to a frigging magic 8-ball that answers your questions, which you just throw away afterwards.<br />
<br />
Undoubtably you now think I'm overreacting... 'dude, it's just a forum'. Wrong. You see, the fact that anubis is a Senior Member is indeed something to be proud of, because it means he's contributed a lot of posts here in a short time.<br />
Browse around, you'll find little useless blabber, but mostly interesting discussions about visualisations.<br />
<br />
And when Mr(s). Newbie comes along and asks for the gazillionth time how to stop the presets from cycling around, even though it's in a thread at the top named &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; and manages to post it in the wrong forum as well (even though each forum has a clear, descriptive line below its title), it kind of tends to piss you off.<br />
<br />
A forum is indeed a place to get answers, but if someone has already asked something before, the person should visit those threads instead of the others here having to repeat what they said before. There is no endless void at the bottom of the forum page.<br />
In this case it's better to resurrect an old thread, bundle all the information in one spot, and save the people who visit after you from having to read several fragmented threads.<br />
That's not just courtesy, that's keeping the forum usable for everyone, so others can come here and get help in the fastest possible way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the thread you should've found. Took me three clicks in the Wishlist forum: &quot;show threads from last 60 days&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, &quot;better avi out program&quot;.<br />

<div class="posttext">Okay, asshole, you come in here with a question that's been asked several times before, and you could've taken five minutes - tops - to find the answer to said question.

Hmm...Let's think.  We aren't your slaves - what if we all adopted that philosophy?  Something about a golden rule comes to mind...Anyhow, when we tell you how this forum works (the above statements in a nutshell), you say: &quot;...save it for somebody who cares.&quot;<br />
