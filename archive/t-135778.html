      <p class="post-content">Well,very nice pack,you gained more XP on the aestethics side :) Personal favourites : Soft cusion,The barrel(looks better without wrap) and Particles for fun.<br />
      Rating : 4,7/5<br />
      PS.Sorry,i`d write a review but it would take too much and im sooo fucking busy these days in real life.Maybe i`ll have some more free time tomorrow.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><b>Intro</b> - I think you forgot the picture for the picture render - either that or it's not where it's supposed to be or somethin'. Good fireworks, though. Just try to keep them from being constant circles if you can - try to make the particles move at different speeds.<br />
      <b>Bouncy Spiro</b> - Interesting, although it could use a better background - maybe a custom starfield instead of that.<br />
      <b>Empty Lift Hole</b> - Hate the colors, but it's a good technical preset. Not the most exciting since the spheres don't do much.<br />
      <b>Heavenly Buildings</b> - Okay, but try to move the camera around a little more - it's too much of the same view angles.<br />
      <b>Need For Responsiveness</b> - Good responsiveness, but the texture is crap in my opinion.<br />
      <b>From The Peephole</b> - A little too foggy and the edges of the "peephole" are very jagged, but it's a nice preset otherwise.<br />
      <b>Blood On The Dance Floor</b> - Good preset, but I don't like the shaking in it - just have the fog-like stuff flow instead of shaking.<br />
      <b>Smooth And Flowing</b> - The flashing bump is kinda annoying and the preset isn't too exciting. Not the best in the pack although I do like your APE.<br />
      <b>Junction To Eternity</b> - Similar in style to the peephole preset, but this one is ten times better - love the swirling in it. One of my favorites in the pack even though the tiled stuff in the background part aren't that great.<br />
      <b>Future VIS</b> - Don't like the movements, but the MP's are nice - especially there weird shape.<br />
      <b>Superspiro</b> - I didn't really like EL-VIS's superspiro thing, but this one's is nice. Don't know exactly why I like it, but I think it's mostly because this one moves and is smaller.<br />
      <b>Rotation Delay DM</b> - Love this preset - the flowing is awesome. Don't like the BG that much, but it's ok.<br />
      <b>Trapped In A Cube</b> - I'm sure this would be better if the texer pictures were included, but I can barely see the dots and that probably really takes away from the preset.<br />
      <b>Fire On Ice</b> - Not my favorite, but I don't really like any of the fire presets made so far in AVS.<br />
      <b>FC - Recall The Old Memories</b> - Really like the colors and the flowing is alright.<br />
      <b>Confused Matrix</b> - Nice look, but it would be better if the camera could move through the "walls" instead of being stuck in the one box.<br />
      <b>Confused Matrix 2</b> - Like the other one more - this one is harder to see what it is.<br />
      <b>Haunted Flow</b> - Could be better, and I don't have 5 minutes right now to stare at it.<br />
      <b>Particles For Fun</b> - Really confusing looking, but I like the background.<br />
      <b>Another Floe Remix</b> - Don't like. Very boring.<br />
      <b>Sphere</b> - Fail to see the sphere, but it's a cool preset nonetheless.<br />
      <b>Music Printshop Pro</b> - Nice, but the inside a cube preset has been done a bit too much for me to really like this.<br />
      <b>The Barrel</b> - Cool looking barrel and I like the movement of the screen, and the colors are ok. Don't like the vibrating squares though.<br />
      <b>Slimy Worms</b> - Is something missing from this? It's only a background(although the background is nice).<br />
      <b>Exactly Opposite</b> - Very empty without the texer.<br />
      <b>Solid Dynamic Contours</b> - Edges are too sharp, but I guess they have to be to look like contours. Maybe add some sort of color mask on top of it to spice it up some.<br />
      <b>Starry Night On Beach</b> - The water looks really weird and the moon has a line missing from it. Others of this kind have been made that I like more.<br />
      <b>Softy Soft Cushion</b> - Your comment needs editing - it says that this is Empty Lift Hole. Don't like the weird SSC's, but it's ok.<br />
      <font color="red">Overall:4.0</font>. There are some great presets in here, but then some of them could be taken out. Sorry if my presets became less helpful, but after reviewing about half of them and then seeing how many there were I just rushed through the rest. You're really starting to make some very good stuff Shreyas. Can't wait for more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice pack, some good visuals in here, but the APE thing you overblowed a little... i mean d=0 APE? Give me a break... Does that really need to be "optimized" that you need to write a separate APE for it? Jeez... Besides you have your Dynamic Clear Screen APE, what do you need the d=0 for? :weird:<br />
      <br />
      Like i said, the presets are ok, but you don't need to write an APE for every single avs effect... Or are you next going to make r=r+t ape? x=x+xt;y=y+yt APE's? How about d=d*zoom APE?</p>

      <p class="post-content">for d=d*zoom, we already have blitter feedback and r=r+t, we have roto blitter :p I made that APE in about 10 mins when an argument popped out somewhere in the forums, and then I thought I might as well distribute it. it is about 2 fps faster :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Your avatar is kinda....jumpy, i suggest you take three frames(one starting PS2 then have sweep clock animation for 10 frames to go to the "X" sign then again the same sweep clock animation to return to the PS2) that would make it better:) or you can give me the pics so i can help you with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I had the PS2 and X Box logo stop for 5 seconds so people don't know if it is going to change or not. The reason it still looks jumpy is because the 2 photos have black backgrounds. So, you can't tell were it changes at times. If you focus on the center then you can tell it isn't missing any frames.</p>
