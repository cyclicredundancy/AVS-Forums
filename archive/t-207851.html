<div class="posttext">I am really looking forward to download Bitmapped II (which is amongst the best AVS packs ever), but I can't find it on the winamp.com site. I also tried searching the forums, but of no avail. I remember it being posted on deviantArt as well &amp; I bookmarked that link, but devArt have removed it :(<br />
<br />
Can someone (including the author Tuggummi himself, that would be great) post a link to the Bitmapped II pack? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tip, though</div></div><hr />

Weird, all the search results contain 1 russian site and the rest are winamp &amp; deviantart pages which don't exist anymore. And the links in the russian site lead to winamp-com pages that don't exist either.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should double-check yathosho before trying to be such a smart-ass :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">All the links i get from that google query return winamp &amp; devart pages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway here's a little story.<br />
<br />
[18:09] * Raz001 has joined #finnish-flash<br />
[18:09] * JDm- sets mode: +v Raz001<br />
[18:10] &lt;Raz001&gt; anyone have lots of tuggummi installers?<br />
[18:10] &lt;Raz001&gt; for tuggummi is an arse<br />
[18:11] &lt;Jaak&gt; is it even possible to install tugummi?<br />
[18:11] &lt;Jaak&gt; tuggummi*<br />
[18:28] &lt;Tuggummi&gt; No, i don't have installers for my arse.<br />
[18:29] &lt;Jaak&gt; mmm... installing ass<br />
[18:30] &lt;Tuggummi&gt; Hmm, soft ass or hard ass?<br />
[18:31] &lt;Raz001&gt; most of my avs bitmaps mysteriously went missing<br />
[18:31] &lt;Jaak&gt; well, installing soft ass is easy and all, but i get best satticfaction installing hard ass<br />
[18:31] &lt;Jaak&gt; :P<br />
[18:32] &lt;Tuggummi&gt; Yeah, plus soft ass wastes CPU cycles.<br />
[18:33] &lt;Raz001&gt; so yeah, tuggummi sucks, i need the installers<br />
[18:34] &lt;Raz001&gt; i like the statement you made with the simple as possible thing, but then my avs folder broke, now you suck<br />
[18:50] * Raz001 has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So im a arse and 90% of my packs aren't online anymore, so tough luck! :p (90% includes bitmapped II)<br />
<br />

There is a reason i took them down, because i don't want them to be shared anymore, then some asshole goes around spreading them to people anyway. MY COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL YOU FUCK!<br />

From now on yathosho, don't go spreading around my avs presets without asking me first. That includes originals &amp; remixes, you can't just assume I will be okay with that. So ask me first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You see Triton4, what you probably dont know is that Tugg has a rare condition called sandyvaginitis which causes him to be irritable and irrational, its best to stand clear.<br />
<br />
And Tugg, Yath is right in that your work was posted into the public domain with written consent allowing distribution, you can't retract that as an when you feel like it. You can ask NICELY that people do not continue to distribute it, which might envoke a better response than screaming blue murder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">so? i have the platform to spread other people's work, to get them more attention. usually people appreciate that. from what i read from your preset-comments, you tolerate this perfectly. why don't you calm down, you make an elephant out of a fly.<br />
<br />
i think you have a serious inferiority complex.. i don't say this to insult you, i just have the impression you might need help.. or your simply overreacting in a post-puberty way.<br />
<br />
don't expect any further replies from me, this is pointless and mostly stupid.</div></div><hr />

I thought that taking my packs off would kinda indicate that i don't want them to be shared anymore. Silly me for not insulting your intellingence and patronizing you. Well clearly you thought wrong because people ARE sharing your packs around, if you feel so damn passionately about it surely you would want to be as explicit as possible</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Technically yes, you can go on spreding my stuff all you want and remix it i have nothing legally against you on that, but you should've known better yat. You should've know that i don't want them to be spread, you should've realized that if i take them off it doesn't mean you have to find alternative ways to go on distributing my stuff.<br />
<br />
Legally you aren't doing anything wrong.<br />
But if you continue like this without asking people of what they think about you doing whatever it is that you do to their presets, eventually someone else than a man with sand in his vagina will get hurt.</div></div><hr />

And why im so passionate about this? Well gee, it wouldn't have anything to do with the obvious &quot;all tuggummi avs presets mega collection pack&quot; im going to do in the future that will include all of my stuff, but updated for speed and compatible with the new avs version. Just don't want people having inferior versions of my stuff when it comes out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You cant whitewash history, besides some people might be interested in the older versions, I personally enjoy seeing the progression in peoples work. What if Michelangelo had repainted the cistene chapel every year.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Im not going to change the looks, just the technics.<br />
<br />
If michelangelo would've had modern painting tools, the sistine chapel might not look different, just better (more details, better colors and it probably wouldn't have taken him 12 years to do it)</div></div><hr />
