      Yup, its that time again, when I ask you, my AVS buddies, to give me a little help in making my pack bigger and better than it already will be. Any remixes that you would like to put into my eighth pack can be submitted here or e-mailed directly to me. I have submitted a few presets to deviantart since I released J7, you can find them at <a href="http://jheriko.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://jheriko.deviantart.com</a> along with the rest of my work. I don't mind if you remix things from my earlier packs and I don't mind if the remixes are minor edits.. as long as they look good and are suitably different to things that I have already made then they will most likely be added.<br />
      <br />
      Happy remixing.<br />
      <br />
      (I won't be posting a zip of some of the p8 presets up here because I can't be arsed to make a new zip file right now.... instead you can go and get them from deviantart)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i whipped up a couple of remixes for you. Hope you like em.<br />
      <br />
      And yes you can rename them if you want :)<br />
      <br />
      And if you want to use the addittive blend in "Jheriko on Fire" (read comment) You can do that too, because im not sure which is better... I mean it looks cool as "transparent", but behind it it looks like something never done before :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just out of interest - I have major dramas with deviant art - takes forever!! I dont' think they have a mirror over here so even on broadband she's pretty slow. Could you include the zip to make things a little easier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay... here is a little zip file of a few presets i released at deviantart... including the pre-release sonic battleground (the broken one with just one ship).. but I'm not giving out the final version yet. Out of laziness I haven't bothered to include any APEs the only other file needed is jherikot1.bmp which is included.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the remixes Tug... the morphing one definately seems to slot into the 'Cliched Jheriko Presets' category... I'm going to have to delete half of the pack now that I've realised that all I do is put big morphing superscopes in front of flowing background DMs. :P The fire one is pretty cool... although I would have clipped the image behind the fire in a different manner, it still runs fast and looks cool.<br />
      <br />
      Edit: I have updated some of these presets to use the multi filter... you may want to download that too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I love the morphing in Morph. The background isn't that great, IMHO.<br />
      Don't really like the screwed up cylinder in Scoped Again.<br />
      Love Sonic Battlefield. The little car think isn't that great though.<br />
      I like Tug's remix of Jheriko on fire more, but this is nice too.<br />
      The torus/sky dome is technical, but doesn't look all that great. Also, the stars on the edge that flash look kinda cheap(I'm guessing they flash because you are hiding the points behind the camera???).<br />
      [EDIT]<br />
      Wow, I just realized that the sonic battlefield doesn't use a DM. That makes it even better. Truly amazing.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I edited the Jheriko On Fire Preset a bit, because in my opinion the dm was damn ugly and sucked up major fps (1-3fps :p) So i replaced them with couple of blended movements and made the fire addittive. Also added some zooming code into the scope. Looks mucho better, but Jheriko if you want to use the previous one then that's fine :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is a couple of more remixes for you.<br />
      <br />
      The other one is a remix from your Rejected 2 preset since i really liked that scope and it would be a shame to go it to waste :(<br />
      <br />
      The other one i did, because i thought i should do some other remixes than scopes with backgrounds (heheh) ;)<br />
      <br />
      I think this is enough, if it's too much then you atleast have a choice to pick the best :) (i don't mind if you don't include all of them)<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!</p>
