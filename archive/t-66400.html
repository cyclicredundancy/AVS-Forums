<div class="posttext">My daughter likes to:<br />
- look at Winamp Visualizations<br />
- bang out sounds on a MIDI keyboard<br />
  attached to my PC's SB-Live-Platinum<br />
  sound card<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can have WinAmp visualizations display the sounds generated by the MIDI device, i.e.: can my daughter see a visual reaction to her banging on the MIDI keyboard?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know that you can find a great number of output plug-ins on the Plug-in section of the winamp website.  I haven't checked to see if there is one, but there's a good chance there is.  Look for one that converts the things from your sound card into WAV.  Hope my post helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find an appropriate plugin.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that an INPUT plugin is what's needed, because sounds generated by my soundcard's MIDI synth must become INPUT for Winamp--Then Winamp's visualizations can just do their normal thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It is possible to make winamp sampling from line-in<br />
start Winamp with the &quot;linein://&quot; option and it starts diplaying the input from the line-in.<br />
But you have to output and read the output simultaneounsly, that could be a bit more complicated. If your soundcard is full-duplex-capable, just try hooking up the line-out and the line-in connectors of your soundcard and try if you see something when playing sound with another program.<br />
In Multimedia-Settings and also in Winamp you need to choose the Windows-Wavemapper as the output-device.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, I know Geiss has made plugins that have incorporated the ability to generate the visualization just with whatever your sound card processes-you can use a microphone or line-in.  You might ask him nicely whether he would be willing to help you figure out how to make AVS work in your setup.  (It's a good idea to include your system information-especially for your sound card, processor speed, operating system, and RAM.)  Here's the e-mail that is listed on the winamp website:  Geiss@landoleet.org<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.  If Geiss doesn't know how to make AVS do it, then it's a pretty safe bet that it can't be done.<br />
<br />
Sorry I haven't been able to help you:(</div></div><hr />
