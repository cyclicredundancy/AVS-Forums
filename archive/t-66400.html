      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need Help Visualizing PC's Audio Output</strong><br />
      My daughter likes to:<br />
      - look at Winamp Visualizations<br />
      - bang out sounds on a MIDI keyboard<br />
      attached to my PC's SB-Live-Platinum<br />
      sound card<br />
      <br />
      Is there any way I can have WinAmp visualizations display the sounds generated by the MIDI device, i.e.: can my daughter see a visual reaction to her banging on the MIDI keyboard?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>output plug-ins</strong><br />
      I know that you can find a great number of output plug-ins on the Plug-in section of the winamp website. I haven't checked to see if there is one, but there's a good chance there is. Look for one that converts the things from your sound card into WAV. Hope my post helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Still Need Help</strong><br />
      Thanks for the reply.<br />
      <br />
      I have yet to find an appropriate plugin.<br />
      <br />
      It seems to me that an INPUT plugin is what's needed, because sounds generated by my soundcard's MIDI synth must become INPUT for Winamp--Then Winamp's visualizations can just do their normal thing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is possible to make winamp sampling from line-in<br />
      start Winamp with the "linein://" option and it starts diplaying the input from the line-in.<br />
      But you have to output and read the output simultaneounsly, that could be a bit more complicated. If your soundcard is full-duplex-capable, just try hooking up the line-out and the line-in connectors of your soundcard and try if you see something when playing sound with another program.<br />
      In Multimedia-Settings and also in Winamp you need to choose the Windows-Wavemapper as the output-device.<br />
      <br />
      Hope it helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>one other idea</strong><br />
      Well, I know Geiss has made plugins that have incorporated the ability to generate the visualization just with whatever your sound card processes-you can use a microphone or line-in. You might ask him nicely whether he would be willing to help you figure out how to make AVS work in your setup. (It's a good idea to include your system information-especially for your sound card, processor speed, operating system, and RAM.) Here's the e-mail that is listed on the winamp website: <a href="mailto:Geiss@landoleet.org">Geiss@landoleet.org</a><br />
      <br />
      Hope that helps some. If Geiss doesn't know how to make AVS do it, then it's a pretty safe bet that it can't be done.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry I haven't been able to help you:(</p>
