      <p class="post-content">I think this preset is great so far. You need more beat response though! Like as in the planet grows and shrinks depending on the volume of the song. Things like that, because without beat response, a preset is quite monotonous.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think the preset's pretty cool, but could use some color. It may be possible to add the beat response (mentioned earlier) into the coloring, although what I'm envisioning would probably involve some rather creative use of gmegabuf(). I'll experiment a bit with that and see what I come up with.<br />
      <br />
      That little scope with the Convolution Filter is a nice touch.</p>
