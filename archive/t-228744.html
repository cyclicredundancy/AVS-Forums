      It's not what it appears to be. I tried a stereo 3D image in avs.<br />
      See the comment for instructions!<br />
      Say if you think it's a great new useful idea or if you've seen this crap a dozen times before!</p>

      <p class="post-content">try changing the reg20 value which can be found somewhere down the frame box of the first superscope [it's the variable with the bigger text field next to it].<br />
      changing it to 0.2 will make a bigger rotation difference between the 2 scopes. maybe it's more easy to see then...<br />
      <br />
      if this won't help reduce the reg11 value to sth between 0.9 and [minimum]0.4 to achieve more perspective distortion in each scope.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was never able to get that kind of stereoscopy to work for me. I just couldn't get my eyes to cross the right way. I was never able to see those images in the "magic eye" things, for example.<br />
      <br />
      However, I do have one of those pairs of red/blue 3D glasses, and I've been experimenting with that kind of 3D in Winamp for a while. (My latest success has been submitted to "Winamp Forums Compilation 3". I'll have to plug that pack once it's released.)</p>
