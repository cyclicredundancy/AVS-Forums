			<strong>taskbar flashes in fullscreen if not on bottom</strong><br />
		
		

		if my taskbar (the thing with the start button) is on the top or side of the screen isntead of the bottom as it is by default, it will flash while avs is in fullscreen. otherwise its invisible.<br />
<br />
smells like buggy code to me.

		1: don't use avs fullscreen, it's slow, ugly, slow, low res, and most of all, slow as HELL<br />
2: if you absolutely MUST use it fullscreen, try using wait for retrace or page flipping

1. Fullscreen does have many advantages.  Namely, for use at parties or just to throw on a large television while you listen to music.  It isn't always slow and ugly - unless you have an old computer - it can run at fast speeds(although this reduces quality), or it can run with great quality(reducing speed).  Some computers can run it nicely(like I expect my dual Xeon 3.06GHz, 4GB Ram computer to do when I get it).<br />
2. That is the only thing that I can think of that can fix it.  Shadowdragon, if changing those doesn't work, then I think you may want to let nullsoft know - they may find time to fix it.<br />
<br />
Raz,<br />
I'm sure he has a reason that his taskbar is at the top, and I used to have a setup that it looked much better to have it at the top than at the bottom.  I think he knows that putting it at the bottom will fix it.

		It wasn't really a serious suggestion. I'm not entirely sure what it was. Never mind.

		Atero - lets try not to be completely useless. first of all, avs fullscreen is only slow, ugly, and low res because either your computer cant handle it, or you couldnt handle the thought of changing the settings. for me, fullscreen can be as fast as normal mode. its 1024x768 32bpp and looks normal even with pixel doubling.<br />
<br />
raz - i admire your ability to waste space. im not a moron. im sure we all figured out that the taskbar can go on the bottom. the point is that it SHOULDNT cause a problem. what im looking for is to know whether its just me or there is a bug in the program. / if ur making a joke, say so. you could easily make a shithole of your reputation this way. ive seen it happen.<br />
<br />
anubis - ......yeah.<br />
<br />
anywho, thanks guys

You do realize that you're essentially running at 512x384 but with extra overhead?

		wow. define cliche. im not gonna try to describe how meaningless youve labled yourself to be. i proved your comments worthless and the most you can think of to respond with is &quot;go fuck yourself&quot;, as if i've offended you. <br />
<br />
ps - page flipping and wait for retrace had no effect<br />
<br />
now then. if no one else has a comment/solution, i guess i will report this as a bug.

		there are problems with running 512x384. my screen is normally 1024x768, so it takes a few seconds for it to switch. also, it then shoves all the windows into the top left corner. they use about the same resources anyway (not that it matters when ur not using another program), so I find it better to use my normal screen size.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER! if you use overlay mode, then 512x384 and 1024x768 2x are exactly the same, it gets rid of the top and bottom black spaces, and for some reason if fixed the problem with the taskbar.<br />
thanks unconed.

		first of all, it's called the edit button.  second, don't even begin to pull that intelligent bullshit on me, the only thing it proves is that you don't have anything else to say.  i could go on all day doing the exact same fucking thing and pointing out little mistakes you make, questioning your mannerisms and personality, intimidating you and whatnot, but i'd rather sit back and laugh at your sheer and unstoppable lameness.  it's so much easier to piss you off that way.  :rolleyes:

		&quot;intelligent bullshit&quot;. watever. <br />
ya know what, fuck this. im sure we both have better things to do with our time than have this pointless arguement about nothing thats headed nowhere. youve failed to piss me off, and im sure your not moved by my comments either.<br />
<br />
to follow deamons request, its dropped. (contrary to the fact that war is MUCH more fun than peace)
