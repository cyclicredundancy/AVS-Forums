<div class="posttext">Well, I have been researching a lot on 3d ssc's these days and I have made quite a few presets already, in fact I made about 40 for my new pack, which I think I will send day after to winamp.com.<br />
Check out these 2 presets I made. <br />
the first one : Tarangan II actually is a replica of the residential complex where I live.<br />
I live on the 5th floor of the center building which is a 15 floor one. the road's are too broad as compared to the height of the building, but I kept it as It is.<br />
Unfortunately there is no colour as I couldnt make any decent colour coding (except the distance fogging). So, this one is a great black and white preset.<br />
the second one is a 3d cube (of course).<br />
I used UnconeD's technique to make the cube appear to be filled. I like this a lot. Hope you like it!<br />
:) <br />
Shreyas.<br />
Btw. I forgot the main think. Can you all give suggestions to improve Tarangan II, or maybe if anyone here can draw 3d trees. If you can, then will you kindly submit the code here?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow dude, these are sweet. ive been trying to make a cube like that and ive attached how far i got, it takes a bit to get started on mine though. those buildings are niice, i wouldnt have them in space though, id make a sort of city effect and put clouds at the top, etc. That would be better. With the cube make it move around more and erm, do whatever the hell you want with it. :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the cube: i KNOW you don't have to do all that with this one.  basically, you can drop back down to pure R/G/B and use additive blend on all the scopes, then use a pastelling filter (i reccommend using the filter from nic01's &quot;looks pastel&quot; and the fast brightness which seems to have slipped his mind).<br />
the city: if you can make this a randomly generated cityscape - with the stars - it'd be really really cool :) altho people would probably accuse you of ripping off unconed :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The city is nice, but not very reactive or colorful.<br />
The cube is very slow, but nice.  Try having it morph between colors instead of jumping.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wanted to make the residential complex more colourful..but then I couldnt choode the colour, and as buildings do not change colour (! atleast real buildings dont!) i kept them as it is, and now I am working on a plane dm which will be on the bottom of the dm with a bitmap to render the ground.<br />
Anyone got trees for free!!! I made out a conical like thing but it doesnt lookg good.<br />

It is way coooooll............:D :D :D <br />

<div class="posttext">Atero: I had thought about that and made that kind of thing, just like tarangan, in fact I made it before tarangan.( I have included it in the zip)<br />
I have posted my attempt to make a plane, but it isnt working, because there is a lot of random coding involved as I dont know much about dm's :cry:. can somebody help me. I have searched the forums, read the explainatain by UnconeD, but I still cant figure it out..<br />

edit: I changed the smiley in the post to cry from smile,<br />
originally it was ( : c r y : ) [[I have inserted spaces so that you will not get the smiley]] and the result was (:cry:).<br />
so then I removed the brackets :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">With the sky rise, you could have it look like a light source that is moving is shining on them.  Just use a combination of light and shadows to give them some color.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think he is talking about the comments inside the DM code.  Characters like that can be used as a comment introducer in avs rattaplan.  I believe it's a kind of hack, but it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think any character having ascii &gt; 160 can be used, although I am still not sure, as I havant experimented:-<br />
e.g type this:<br />
<br />
r=r+t;<br />
_I am shreyas potnis;<br />
<br />
this will work fine.<br />
the 160th char gives a blank char<br />
<br />
or:<br />
d=d*.98;<br />
Â¥ Cool char :) ;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, I started to make a city with the camera moving all round and the work is going on.<br />
I coded the buildings again from scratch and this time they are made more neat and tidy. Also, I have interchanged the y and z axes.<br />
<br />
Previously, the y axis was the height of the building, whereas the z axis was the depth when viewed from the side if the bilding.<br />
<br />
the initial camera position was on the side of the building.<br />
<br />
But, now the z axis is the height of the building and x and y axes are the position of the building when viewed right from above. This make the coding a lot easier, especially when you have to position the scopes in the enviornment. you get a clearer idea when positioning on x and y axes and most of all, you dont have to bother about the z axis, as the heght of the building is fixed.<br />
the camera has to be tuned a lot, and the buildings have to be multiplied to create a real city, as this is not a random generator.<br />
this buildings are just placed to 2.5 of the x axis, when they go below -2.5. So, the repositioning of the buildings isnt seen.<br />
Play with rx,ry, and rz to rotate the buildings.<br />
t is the position on x axis. when t&gt;2.5 it become -2.5.<br />
<br />
What I want is rx=pi/2;rz=pi;<br />
therefore rx=90 degrees and rz=180 degrees. this brings the building right in front of you. then I have to move the camera.<br />
I have to experiment a more here.<br />
<br />
A WORD OF CAUTION : Dont mess with i1 and i2, they can cause trouble, and you can end up crashing AVS.  let i1=0;i2=0;cn=0; remain as it is in per frame. <br />
<br />
That's it.<br />
Please note that this unfifnished preset.<br />
and DOES NORMALLY, AFTER HOW MUCH TIME IS A PACK PUBLISHED. I SUBMITTED MINE 3 DAYS AGO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice preset dude :) You know your 3d scoping.Try getting fsk`s pickin dim pack...It has a very nice preset that is similar to this urban complex only that is more dynamic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">One more question - when you send the pack to winamp3 site, does it get published in winamp2 site also. or do you have to submit there to.<br />
i have an account in winamp3, but when i type the username and pass in winamp2 site, it gives wrong password.<br />
do you have to make a new account</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nope, it only goes to the WA3 site. Does anybody still go to the WA2 site? The WA2 site is pretty ignored I think.</div></div><hr />
