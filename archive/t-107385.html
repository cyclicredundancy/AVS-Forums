<div class="posttext">Okay, I have two things to say here.<br />
<br />
1: I am SOOOOO close to making a realistic Matrix-style preset, I just need to figure out how to make DDM/DM make a movement go downward...unless somebody has come up with it already.  I can show a sample to you but not untill Megapak II final.<br />
<br />
2: Want me to come out with Megapak II Final?  I decided to go just 10 presets, and that includes the intro preset.  I just need one thing...Can anybody show me how to make a roman number 2 with a superscope?  I need to learn by doing, yes, but when you're blind how can you learn?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you want a movement/dynamic movement to make the text to go down, you could just use the following normal, faster, better looking movement:<br />
<br />
uncheck Source Map<br />
Wrap can be both, just use the one you like more<br />
uncheck Blend<br />
check Bilinear filtering<br />
check Recht Coords<br />
<br />
(user defined)<br />
y=y-0.02;<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
Am I correct in believing that by a roman 2 you mean II? You can make that with 6 lines or maybe 2 sscs with alot of if()'s. I would go for the 6 lines version. If you want them to move, you can just synchronize their movements with getosc() (yes, I know you don't like that, Atero) or Atero's method:<br />
frame: <br />
timer1=timer1+arbitrary1; <br />
<br />
beat: <br />
random1=sin(timer1);</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's the starting point for your superscope:<br />
<br />
x=0;<br />
y=2*i-1;<br />
<br />
play with that, move it(x=x+somenumber), scale it(x=x*somenumber), swap the axes(y=0;x=2*i-1). Eventually you will be able to make a roman numeral 2.<br />
<br />
On the other hand you could be a real l33t0r and make it all in one superscope like I would. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay, this is what I was actually saying about the matrix thing...<br />
<br />
You know how that &quot;Shift Left&quot; is there in the Movements?  I'd like something like that, only making it go Upwards.  Thanks for the downward movement of the text, but now I need the fade effect to go with...or this may just work...Lemme try quick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay...That does not work AT ALL for me.  I do everything and guess what:  NOTHING WORKS.<br />
<br />
If you can make one with one scope, like a 3-d almost, do it and you could make it like a contrabution to the pack...Please?<br />
<br />
Btw, MATRIX LIVES!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, here is a nice simple 3D spinning roman numeral 2 made from a single superscope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that's a nice one for all starting custom programmers to study on..<br />
it's got it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I wouldn't recommend using the point-to-point method for complex scopes though, it slows it down a lot, although I have made some quite complex wireframe geometry with it. If you want to make circles or huge complex 3d shapes its often better to do some maths and plug it in. As long as you remember how 'i' works you can do practically anything.<br />
<br />
The best starting point for scope coding is (IMHO) x=2*i-1;y=v*0.5; since it copies the render simple and is really easy to understand and modify. I can't understand how Xion managed to make &quot;x=2*i-1;y=0;&quot; not work, no offense (if you had the default n=800 and 'dots' turned on it should draw a line of dots). I think I may write some really in-depth superscope tutorials in the near future so that you can all make the scopes that you want or just steal the code from them.<br />
<br />
Learn lots of co-ordinate geometry and you can do anything with superscope. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Xion(810)</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2002, 00:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">...I need that n=800?  I didn't think so...:(<br />
<br />
It does make a line from one edge to the next, but I cannot make it shorter by ANY way possible.  You do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2002, 01:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Set n=2 (n is the number of points that are calculated) and turn 'Lines' on. Now from &quot;x=2*i-1;y=0;&quot; We add to the end &quot;x=x*0.5;&quot; or alternatively we can just do &quot;x=0.5*(2*i-1);&quot; in place of &quot;x=2*i-1;&quot;. You have now shortened the line.<br />
<br />
By multiplying x by a number less than one you are scaling it down by that amount.<br />
<br />
If you want to move the line to the side a bit try adding a number to x. All of this can be applied to y as well.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Have you seen any of my superscope work? Believe me when I say things, the superscope is my favorite AVS component and I strive to know everything it can do, if I say something will do something it normally will (99% accurate :p), sometimes it just takes a while to spot a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Superscopes go through my head like airline food through some people's intestines.  I get nothing about superscopes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Did you even try what I said?<br />
<br />
If you want to make really good AVS you'll have to learn superscope, and code in general, first. It is a fact that almost all of the best AVS presets use either superscope or dynamic movement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Xion(810)</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th October 2002, 00:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Jheriko, I did not try any of it because of one reason:<br />
<br />
I DID NOT GET ANY OF IT. <br />
<br />
I know in order to survive here I need some kind of ability to make superscopes and DM's but I am unable for the reason stated above.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its just co-ordinate geometry, you must have done that in school. I remember being taught the basics of it at school when I was about 6 or 7. Its basically drawing a graph, the only challenge I've ever had with superscope was understanding i.<br />
<br />
You have to try it to understand it, and play with the example code. If you remember the basic syntax like the order of operators, ending every line with a semicolon and only one equals per line and things like that you can mess with it even in a simple way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">jheriko, you're allowed more than 1 expression per line, that's what the ; is for. AVS treats the whole point expression as 1 line anyway, ignoring the LF's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th October 2002, 14:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I know that, I was just trying to explain it in a simple way and I failed miserably. :(<br />
<br />
I expected avs worked like that, because thats how c compilers work too, just parsing once huge string. Don't know about BASIC compilers, they must be clever to know to look for both returns and colons. I always think of semi-colons as marking the end of a line, dunno why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I learned at 6 or 7, but the ONLY thing I've learned from there to now is y=mx+b and ay+bx=c.  and THAT'S IT.  My stupid ass teachers don't want to bother with this complicated shit so they just throw us on either computers or throw us worksheets and book assignments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use that.<br />
<br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
y=m*x+b;<br />
<br />
set m and b in the init box. don't forget to set n=2 and turn on lines.<br />

Qbasic 7 can compile to .exe, surely it actually compiles it properly. It would be rather foolish to make an .exe which works by interpreting the BASIC code, probably even harder than just making the .exe by compiling the code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jheriko, I am not kidding you when I say BASIC exe's are just the BASIC code linked to a dll file. Why else would you need the Visual basic Runtimes?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I meant basic as in qbasic, gwbasic.. vb is a different thing and is really 'hyper-inefficient'. I didn't think that all of it was dependant on the vbrun dll though, that is really weak.</div></div><hr />

That only goes SO FAR.  I cannot get by on just y=mx+b.  I NEED TO KNOW MORE.<br />
<br />
P.s. I got a bootleg version of VB, and don't know how to work it.</div></div><hr />
