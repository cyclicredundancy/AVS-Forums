<div class="posttext">When I run AVS, it runs slow. But what can I expect with 400Mhz? Anyway, I was playing around, resizing the window when I found that while I am actually resizing the window, the AVS runs about twice as smooth. I can click on the corner and just hold the mouse button and it is great. As soon as I let go it is back to slow. Is there something I can do other than sit there holding down the mouse button to make it more smooth?<br />
<br />
I have a 400Mhz Celeron with 196MB of ram and am running XP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are you high or something? Because that sounds like crazy talk :igor: The only reason why it moves more smoothly is that you resized window to a smaller one. The machine im currently on has windows XP and i dind't notice any change when i clicked and holded the corner, i don't even know why i tested it, because it just can't be true :igor:<br />
<br />
If it is, you have a really weird machine indeed!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I belevive it's because when you're resizing the window AVS doesn't respond to the music at all. The same thing happens when you have a menu open. I got an increase of 1 FPS when I tried.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Maybe his presets have weird on-beat code that slows the whole thing down? Or a on beat effect list maybe?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OMG I've experienced this before on a Pentium 166 laptop playing a movie. It ran better while I was giving the app some mouse action. I could think tweaking the CPU priority setting may help, or adjusting the setting in the control panel that makes foreground apps run better.<br />
<br />
I have a sneaking suspicion you're using Windows 2000 Professional. Try updating windows. SP1&amp;2 do wonders.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, Inkey, you should try to get a new comp. Athlon 64's gonna be out soon, so no question what to take ;)<br />
<br />
[Edit] XP aint best solution for slow PC's try using ME or 98. They are not as stabil as XP or NT/2000 but they run faster.</div></div><hr />

That and XP, if humanly possible, is even more shittier piece of software than winamp3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tug, you can't measure the qualty of an application and an os on the same scale. I think you already knew this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I swear it is true. I downloaded the cubes thing to try too. It runs too slow to even watch until I click and hold down the mouse button. And it only runs smoother while I hold the mouse button down. I can resize it smaller and it will go choppy again when I let go. It must be my mouse. The fps stays the same (usually under 10) but it plays smoother anyway. When I turn the priority up, winamp cuts in and out. I am going to get a piece of tape and tape the moust button down so I can watch avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jacheck has said it before, when you hold down the mouse button it runs smoothly cause it does'nt detect any beats.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thats right, believe us Inkey.<br />
<br />
Although i hafte admit, the thought of somebody glueing his mousebutton down to watch AVS is quite amusing. :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">But the goal of AVS is to visualize music.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What about Eyecandy presets then? :-)<br />
<br />
I [ab]use avs for everything i like:<br />
-Visualization<br />
-AVI mixer<br />
-Video sequence creator<br />
-Video stream-in mainpulator / editor<br />
<br />
You can use it for so many things, so why don't?<br />
(ok, not at the price of taping your mouse :blah: )</div></div><hr />
