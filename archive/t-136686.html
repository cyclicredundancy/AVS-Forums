      <a href="http://toniq.deviantart.com" target="_blank">toniq</a> and <a href="http://yathosho.deviantart.com" target="_blank">me</a> will do a <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/nsv/" target="_blank">NSV stream</a> (get a recent winamp with nsv support) next weekend. that's my turntables connected to my pc, sending a shoutcast stream to toniq's line-in. he uses the avs overlay to the video-in of a laptop that has some more vj-software installed. the stream is on a fast line but will most likely require dual-isdn or higher speeds.<br />
      <br />
      i will play a selection of brokenbeat, techno, electro, dub, hiphop and downtempo records.<br />
      <br />
      the details (time and url) will be posted later, so come back if you're interested.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can't wait :D... sounds very cool.<br />

      You should keep a playlist of all the records you've spinned, if possible with time indices. Though I can imagine that you'd probably not want to occupy yourself with that while spinning... get another friend to write down all the titles?<br />
      <br />
      I just hope the line will be able to handle the traffic ;). Streaming NSV is not exactly bandwidth-safe.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      One thing bothers me though... you say you'll be sending a shoutcast stream to the line-in. Do you mean you'll just connect one pc's line-out to the other pc's line-in, or do you mean actually using shoutcast to transfer the audio data? Because Shoutcast has a pretty high latency as far as I know.</p>

      </blockquote>sorry if a bit off topic but i've been searching for a solution to this and wondering what you're using to save. I DJ psy-trance and want to send out enhanced CD's to people. The best way I have come up with so far is to record my mix and then VJ live using Hotlist with it but no idea how to re-capture the audio and AVS??<br />
      <br />
      Anyone help? I've read the old threads about recording and wondered if any advance had happened since 2001....<br />
      <br />
      If this is gonna be a big response could a mod move this to a new thread....thanx :)
