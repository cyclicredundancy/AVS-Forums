      <p class="post-content">Hey Manni. Not too bad, although I reckon you'd better get off your high horse... :D<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, here's my rating by preset:<br />
      <br />
      alien brain: Good thing I had the Metaballs 3D APE. :p Good job with this one, although I think the Buffer Saves were unnecessary. 3/5<br />
      bluelight tunnel: Unfortunately the d=atan(d) command is very overused, but the fading ring gave a good effect. 2.5/5<br />
      BW LCD: Hmm, weird. That's a lot of Timescopes. 2/5<br />
      exploding sun: I'll just say this one has potential. 2.5/5<br />
      greenlight tunnel: Can't say this was terribly original. 2/5<br />
      greeny moves: It would appear that all that Water Bump does is slow down the fps count, but this was nice. 2.5/5<br />
      holy: I've seen better. 1.5/5<br />
      hypno yellow: I quite liked this one. Could've done more than just rotate though. 3/5<br />
      in the eye of the storm: C'mon, you can do better than this. :) 1/5<br />
      iris: This was nice, but some colour variety couldn't have hurt. 3/5<br />
      moving sun: This was eerie, but enjoyable. 2.5/5<br />
      psychotic message: Now this is what I'm talking about! Except you put a space in the dynamove pixel that changed the effect substantially. Still awesome though. 3.5/5<br />
      redlight tunnel: It's just not funny anymore. :D 1/5<br />
      spider: Erm...the picture was cool! 2/5<br />
      starpong: Looks a bit too much like my Fierce Lens Flare. The multiple Blitter Feedbacks just detract from the experience too. 2/5<br />
      wheel: Nice pattern you got going there! I wonder who else still uses the original DDM anymore. 3/5<br />
      white diamond: Work with this just a bit and you'll get something really good happening, I reckon. 2.5/5<br />
      <br />
      Overall: Some good, some not so good. I don't think you need lots of one effect in one preset. Nor do Buffer Saves at the very top and bottom both on Replace have any bearing on what happens. But you definitely show some potential. My favourite is psychotic message.<br />
      <br />
      Aesthetics: :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
      Originality: :) :( :( :( :( 1/2<br />
      Overall: :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
      <br />
      I look forward to your next pack! In the meantime, check out mine if you want. It's uNDefineD 1 - Explosion on the front page of AVS presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>bluelight tunnel suggestion</strong><br />
      I know it defeats the tunnel idea, but I like the overall effect when the movement is changed to r=atan(r) or r=atan(r)+r<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hi UnDeFiNeD...</strong><br />
      Thank you for being objective, I must say that I'm more of an artist than a technician (I make music,too ) so my work is something that represents something to me and not only a set of complicated mathematical formulas...<br />
      Anyway,I assume the fact that I'm a beginner, I've many things to learn and I just want to learn by myself (I can't think of looking after a all made tutorial).<br />
      <br />
      So let's say I'm a different beginner looking for a different experience trying to get things relative to what I want to get...<br />
