<div class="posttext">Everybody knows AVS has a serious speed problem, but many don't know how much faster they can make it without damging the quality of a preset. I'm not talking about lowering resolution, pixel doubling, or disabling bilinear; because that just sucks.<br />
<br />
Back in Winamp 2 I discovered the &quot;Clear every frame&quot; checkbox in the main and all effect lists. many presets had this on but didn't need it. Disabling the ones using DM that redraw the whole screen anyway gave a 5 fps boost.<br />
<br />
Just today I found how much &quot;Wait for retrace in the settings-display took up. Disabling this in one preset gave me a 20 fps boost!<br />
<br />
So, anyone have any AVS/SSC/DM tips to make rendering faster?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">GREAT! Finally a topic worth reading with useful tips :D. Let me add some speedup tips to your small list:<br />
<br />
- Lowering the grid size in DM speeds things up. <br />
- Lowering the n in the init of a superscope speeds things up.<br />
- Don't use any DM/SSC at all, they usually slow things down anyways.<br />
- Disabling effect lists speeds things up as well.<br />
- Buying a faster processor speeds things up.<br />
- drinking a lot of alcohol makes avs look a lot smoother.<br />
- Sit closer to the screen, the bigger the avs window looks, the better.<br />

<div class="posttext">dont use divisions at all, only time i use division is when i need to do:<br />
z=1/rz;<br />
x=rx*z;y=ry*z*asp;<br />
there is no way getting around with this.<br />
<br />
And dont use pow(a,b) it's slow as hell<br />
<br />
if you have:<br />
loop(n,<br />
 assign(a,b)+<br />
 assign(c,d)+<br />
 ...<br />
);<br />
use this instead:<br />
<br />
loop(n,<br />
 exec2(<br />
  exec3(<br />
   assign(a,b),<br />
   assign(c,d),<br />
   assign(e,f)<br />
  ),<br />
 exec3(<br />
  ...,<br />
  )<br />
 )<br />
)<br />
<br />
<br />
use ONLY powers of 2 in your convo filters.<br />
<br />
use ifs a lot when possible, if you have:<br />
if(a,b,c) and if a is true, only b is executed, and if a is false only c is executed and b statement is ignored totaly</div></div><hr />

<br />
to make such fine code check out my AVS Code Translator (http://www.geocities.com/tomyloboavs)<br />
It is also useful for complex if-statements that Jaak mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks Jaak,I never thought of those.<br />
<br />
A question. Convultion is faster using certain numbers. That must mean it doesn't use lookup tables for its values. Would a new verion using this make it faster?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Convolution compiles specific (MMX) assembly code for each kernel. There's more info about in on the forums somewhere (search for posts by cfp).<br />
Please do enlighten us how a lookup table would help speed convolution up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I looked up what you said and figured it wouldn't make it faster. Earlier I had a nice half page of what I ment but it was erased by the back button and stuff. New to the forum's great ways.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">get Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/start/)<br />
it doesnt delete the text in the input text fields if you click the &quot;back&quot; button :)<br />
if you click &quot;forward&quot; after that, it is still there<br />
(and it is HTML 4.0 compatible, safe against most dialers, trojans and stuff and it has an integrated popup blocker that even defeats the most pesky popup methods :))<br />
<br />
to the topic:<br />
Trans/Bump is also very slow (especially if used multiple times)<br />
if you really need a bumpy texture try the following convolution filter: (i wrote only the center 3x3 numbers here)<br />
-3 0 0<br />
0 1 0<br />
0 0 3</div></div><hr />

- Disabling effect lists speeds things up as well.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Surely you want to delete an effect list.. has the same effect as disabling but is probably a tiny tiny bit faster.<br />
<br />
DM/SSC only slow things down if they are complex... simple DMs are lightning fast and even complex SSCs can be run on their own at blinding speeds.<br />
<br />
I find that most of the 'trans' effects suck huge amounts of fps up compared to the simpler 'render' effects like superscopes, moving particle, simple etc.<br />
<br />
Increasing line width slows stuff down too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Also using Blend filter and Bilinear filtering at the same time slows things down drastically.....</div></div><hr />
