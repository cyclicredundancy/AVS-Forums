      <p class="post-content"><strong>Visualization as a Background?</strong><br />
      Is there a way to make AVS a "background image"? I was thinking of some kind of presentation deal and overlaying text on top of the visualization. Possible? Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">With the new version of AVS you should be able to do basically whatever you want. Global variables to keep track of what slide you're on, and then just text output - although I don't know if the new version has done much to improve the text render which was horrible in previous versions. I really should get back and mess with AVS some more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can set a color for overlay color, use it to show stuff in PPoint, and set alpha to total... (assuming you have Win2K or WinXP)<br />

      If it's a presentation, I think that option is the best...</p>

      <p class="post-content">5 Steps to the easiest and in your case best way (imo):<br />
      <br />
      1. Make your presentation in PowerPoint, with background set to one color.<br />
      <br />
      2. Run winamp -&gt; avs -&gt; settings -&gt; display -&gt; overlay mode ON.<br />
      <br />
      3. Set overlay color to exactly the same color as your background color in your PowerPoint Presentation.<br />
      <br />
      4. Swap back to Powerpoint, and run your presentation.<br />
      <br />
      5. Have lot's of fun.</p>
