		I liked warp grid and flow. Quite nice work. Nothing else really jumped out at me. I really don't like that stickman preset, the whole particles everywhere, pointy sphere thing irritates me.<br />
<br />
The fish thing annoys me as well. It's just, unconeds preset, exactly the same, but with more ugly colours, take inspiration but don't just steal an idea straight from someone.

		One major thing I would suggest is color coding things better.  Dont just throw in random colors.  Even if the colors go through the whole spectrum make sure all the colors fit together.  That'll make a lot of your presets a little more sharp and organized.

Sorry about that, I didn't really mean to steal the idea.  But that's how it came out.  <br />
