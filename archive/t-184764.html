<div class="posttext">4 presets here,<br />
<br />
first off a update of oceanlab, with some help from pak9, i added (well he coded them) 3d starfield ssc's with some musicresponse in the speed and i also made the starfield go different ways instead of just forwards<br />
<br />
then we have, grayed out summer, don't be fooled by the name, this is a gooey colorful presets<br />
<br />
then we have jheriko's mdma overdose ,i found a colortrick, and i didn't what to do with it so i decided to take the base from my remix of jheriko's the canyon and then adding it, then when i saw it, it turned out mint so what i did was to build on the preset, and after that the preset was different from my remix so then asked jheriko if i could release it under my own name and he was perfectly ok with it, i also included a tweak of the preset that our unconed did<br />
<br />
most of the people that has been in #finnish-flash has already seen this (as i've sended the presets to many of you) but whatever</div></div><hr />
