			<strong>AVS Fullscreen Media Controls</strong><br />
		
		

		I have searched and have not come up with a likeable solution yet.<br />
<br />
I have a CarPc setup and I want AVS to be running, but I want to also be able to PLAY/PAUSE/STOP/NEXT/BACK and volume without using the keyboard.  All I have avaiable is mouse1 through the touchscreen.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to display these control icons in any visualizations?

		By default, not that I'm aware of. As far as I know AVS does not give any information back to the player (or any other visualization for that matter).<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone has come up with a creative solution?

		don't use full screen, use windowed and stretch it over the screen.<br />
<br />
and use a skin that has all those buttons at the bottom.

		use the clearone skin.<br />
<br />
make the avs windowed and fill the entire screen.<br />
<br />
and have the main window(winshade mode) over the top. inside the avs window.<br />
<br />
looks mad. and you have some avs controls at the bottom.<br />
<br />
you'll need a cool background.<br />
<br />
i think you might have troubles with the main window always not being on top.<br />
<br />
maybe you can contact the maker of the skin to modify it to always be there.<br />
<br />
i'd be interested in this aswell.

		If the worst comes to the worst you can always make a seperate application for sending the keys on to winamp from some buttons... thats quite a bit of effort though, especially if you don't write code.

		For a lower resolution there is pixel doubling..<br />
You could also try overlay mode and minimize winamp.. I don't know if that would work in a CarPc though.<br />
<br />
Aren't there any skins that have player control in the AVS window by the way? Then you can even put the main window behind the AVS window.

There is always a way to do something. Windows needs some logic to decide which &quot;always on top&quot; window is actually topmost after all. Fullscreen is just another window in disguise unless you use the fullscreen overlay mode, which works slightly differently.
