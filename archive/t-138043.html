      <p class="post-content"><strong>Radar Pack</strong><br />
      This is a small pack I made of radar based presets. There are only three presets, and two of them are very simular with only minor changes. These are my first presets to use a custom Superscope. I hope you all enjoy them. Please let me know what you think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup, the picture has no effect on the preset(s), also you do realize that you can't publish presets that use picture's not made by you? Anything, wheter or not you scanned from a magazine or copied from a website is copyright protected and there for you cannot use it in your presets if you plan to publish them.<br />
      <br />
      In short, don't use picture's that you haven't made yourself! It's illegal without the author's permission (and i doubt you can get permission to use the matrix pics...)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using pictures in presets when there is no effect will do the following things[list=1][*]Ruin the fps of the preset(s)[*]Increase the size of the downloading preset[*]Will put you in more trouble if you have any copyright problem[/list=1]<br />
      Better you delete it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've removed the image, and the preset that uses it. I'll put the new pack up a little later when I get home. Thanks for the advice shreyas_potnis, and Tuggummi. It won't happen again.</p>
