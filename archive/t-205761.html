<div class="posttext">I'm helping a friend put on an art show. One of the things he's going to do is have music playing and he wants to have a screen with some type of visualization projected that's reacting to the music. The music is going to be produced live so I can't just play it back. Is there any way to run AVS or another plugin and have it process the audio line-in rather than what is playing in WinAmp? I know I used to do it with the Geiss back in the day, but that may have been a stand alone app.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or pointers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">first search the forums, because it is answered. also it is in the FAQ, so you didn't read that either. nevermind...<br />
<br />
soo, you can make winamp feed the plugins (like geiss, milkdrop or AVS) from the line input with opening the location &quot;linein://&quot; with ctrl+l keycombination or the open location tap on the playlist.</div></div><hr />
