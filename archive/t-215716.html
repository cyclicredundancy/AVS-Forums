      These are a few of my earlier insanities... I not quite as fond of them. They are a little too flashy but maybe someone will like them. It is easy to see that most of them are just variations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">lease avoid double posting. You could have posted them together. (If everyone posted his stuff in seperate threads it would get a bit confusing here).<br />
      <br />
      Ok a few words bout your work: as you said yourelf, they are too flashy. And a bit too dark imo. Another example of the well known 'basic-beginners'-work. Sorry, nothing special among it.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>a question</strong><br />
      sorry about the double posting man.<br />
      <br />
      I just had a question... Do u see how there is that diagonal axis in the mystery variations? I really wanted to make that spin or rotate back and forth or something.. do u know how I could do that?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The movement with the formula: r = atan(-x-y * 4) should be replaced by a dynamic movement to make it move.<br />
      <br />
      Put on wrap and bilinear filtering,<br />
      put gridsize on something like 16x16,<br />
      put your formula in the pixel-part,<br />
      put the formulas like the following one in frame:<br />
      t=t+.1; q=sin(q)<br />
      <br />
      Now change your formula by multiplying or adding q:<br />
      e.g.: r = atan(-x-y * 4 * q)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah, 'trans/movement' can only perform static changes. It only seems to be 'dynamic', when 'clear every frame' is disabled.<br />
      'trans/dynamic movement' is the effect of choice if you wish to have beat/music etc. dependent motion.</p>
