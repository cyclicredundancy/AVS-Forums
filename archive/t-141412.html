      <p class="post-content"><strong>Need Color Map</strong><br />
      Ok here is the situation. I'm at a friendâ€™s house and I tried to show him a cool preset. The problem is that it is no longer in color. His Winamp (2.91) doesn't support color map. Where can I find this Render? I have seached the forums and Winamp's plugins but had no luck.</p>

      <br />
      It's not a render (it's a trans), and it does NOT come with Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      Get it off Deviantart (<a href="http://deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://deviantart.com</a>), under Visualizations -&gt; AVS APE</p>

      <p class="post-content">A nice search of the winamp forums for colormap yielded this thread:<br />

      <br />
      There's also a nice APE collection thread somewhere around this forum that should have it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea I found a collection of APE on the forums but the collection was just too massive. Oh and thank you for the help Nic01. It is now showing all of the colors one again. The wierd thing is that I don't know how it got on my computer at home.<br />
      <br />
      The only reason I thought it was a render is because the config in AVS said, "unknown render object." Where the color map was supposed to be. Here is the more <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1646190" target="_blank">direct link</a> for future reference. You know, in case someone has the same question some time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You probably got it on your computer before when you downloaded some pack that used it(which many do).</p>
