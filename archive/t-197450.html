			<strong>round(n)</strong><br />
		
		

		Would people find it useful is there was a round(,) function. Eg. round1(x1) would round x1 to the nearest whole number and round10(x1) would round x1 to the nearest 10. It would be useful to use with the boolean functions.

		Don't you *nearly* have thsi already<br />
<br />
YOu have the int function right that rounds towards zero<br />
<br />
e.g. <br />
<br />
x = 3.1; int(x) = int(3.1) = 3 <br />
x = 3.6; int(x) = int(3.6) = 3;<br />
<br />
Not rounding just truncating<br />
<br />
now if you do <br />
<br />
int(x+0.5) it is  (for positive numbers) the same as your round(x)<br />
<br />
e.g. in the above example again<br />
<br />
x = 3.1; int(x+0.5) = int(3.1+0.5) = int(3.6) = 3<br />
x = 3.6; int(x+0.5) = int(3.6+0.4) = int(4.1) = 4<br />
<br />
and that is the same as round is it not.<br />
<br />
It gets a little more complex for doing negative numbers as well in the same equation but can be done with the odd if.<br />
<br />
edit/ and round10 is not there far off either<br />
<br />
10*int((x/10)+0.5) or probably sightly quicker 10*int((x*0.1)+0.5)<br />
<br />
but you can have any rounding equation.<br />
<br />
This is all from memory and no way to check as no winamp here atm but hopefully the principles are there.

		ceil(bla) rounds up, floor(bla) rounds down.<br />
bla|0 rounds to the nearest integer<br />
<br />
ceil(3.2356)=4<br />
floor(6.9123)=6<br />
3.42135|0=3<br />
3.5555|0=4<br />
<br />
If you want it to round to decimals you have to multiply the number by power of 10 before you round it (10 for 1 decimal, 100 for 2 decimals etc.), and then divide it by the same number after you round it<br />
<br />
ceil(3.2356*10)/10=3.3<br />
floor(6.9123*100)/100=6.91<br />
((3.42135*1000)|0)/1000=3.421

		sorry didn't realise you had them functions although I didn't think of |
