		Don't worry about the subject line, it's just that some lyrics got stuck in my head while making this preset. :)<br />
<br />
I want your advice on the spectrum analyzer, I know it can be done way easier than this here. I only used my own logic to figure out how to make one, so I know it's not perfect.<br />
<br />
Maybe the preset was influenced by the lyrics, too...

		Cool the tornado goes to the music also. I didn't even think of doing that. What do you think of the moon, does it look real? Remember that I made it look nice in a 400x300 window.

		I don't think it needs that thick line around the edge, mabey only have a half-moon because i couldn't really tell what it was until i read the comment. Why not just use a texer image?

		I optimized it a little by drawing the moon for the first 35 frames, storing it in a buffer, and then using the buffer the rest of the time. I still can't get the moon to look better, but I'm trying. Also, I'm still messing with the spectrum analyzer.

		I know I can put a picture in there. :)<br />
I just wanted to be artistic and shit and try to make one. You should see me draw, dude, I'm really good.<br />
<br />
A really easy way to make an effect list enabled only on the first frame is to enable the evalutation override and just put &quot;enabled=1&quot; in it's init box. Then disable the effect list.<br />
<br />
When the preset is loaded, on the first frame it reads &quot;enabled=1&quot; in the init, which turns it on. Then at the second frame it looks in the frame section of the evaluation override, but there's nothing there. Since the enable checkbox isn't marked it just doesn't enable it anymore.

		Changed some things:<br />
<br />
-- Use ALT key to turn on/off text display<br />
-- colorized the oscilloscope<br />
-- Made preset change from 'night' to 'day' settings.

		Cool thanks!<br />
Now I'm trying to get the colors to gradually blend from 'night' to 'day' instead of switching suddenly.
