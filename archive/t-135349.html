      <p class="post-content">Good presets in there.<br />
      <br />
      Man, I can barely remember making that remix that I put in there. Don't like it - there are several things I should have done differently. Oh well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dont know.. ther are some relly cool remixs in there but i have a bit of critique.<br />
      <br />
      there are alot of n00bish remixs in there, i dont want to mention who's they are, because then head might fly. but i really wouldnt have included some of them if it were my pack.. but hey, its not my pack so.. <font color="red"><b>=S</b></font><br />
      <br />
      also, there are alot of flying between to planes ones, which is good, but not to this extent.<br />
      <br />
      other than that.. its a really nice pack, and not one i will delete simply because my avs folder is getting to big to keep ordered. BTW, does anyone know a way to allow avs to see subfolders?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty damn nice remix pack :up: Too bad i can't "like" my own remixes :D<br />
      <br />
      Overall Raz's remixes were top class, but Magic's Blackhole Flipside remix is the sweetest remix in the pack! I really enjoyed that one :)<br />
      <br />

      And i don't know what you did to us (hypnotize?) so we would do all the work for you, but it seemed to work ;) :blah:</p>
