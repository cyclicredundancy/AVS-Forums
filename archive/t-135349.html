		Good presets in there.<br />
<br />
Man, I can barely remember making that remix that I put in there.  Don't like it - there are several things I should have done differently.  Oh well.

		I dont know.. ther are some relly cool remixs in there but i have a bit of critique.<br />
<br />
there are alot of n00bish remixs in there, i dont want to mention who's they are, because then head might fly. but i really wouldnt have included some of them if it were my pack.. but hey, its not my pack so.. <font color="red"><b>=S</b></font><br />
<br />
also, there are alot of flying between to planes ones, which is good, but not to this extent.<br />
<br />
other than that.. its a really nice pack, and not one i will delete simply because my avs folder is getting to big to keep ordered. BTW, does anyone know a way to allow avs to see subfolders?

		Pretty damn nice remix pack :up: Too bad i can't &quot;like&quot; my own remixes :D<br />
<br />
Overall Raz's remixes were top class, but Magic's Blackhole Flipside remix is the sweetest remix in the pack! I really enjoyed that one :)<br />
<br />
<br />
And i don't know what you did to us (hypnotize?) so we would do all the work for you, but it seemed to work ;) :blah:

Tried to do that, and from what I've found and heard it appears to be impossible... :(
