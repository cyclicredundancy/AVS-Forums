<div class="posttext">Nice use of your torus, I don't really like black and white presets though, so I think it could use some colors. I also think it is a little bit to spastic and flashy. You should learn to use dynamic movements/movements, instead of that crazy movement thing you have right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I know how to use DM, but the torus is shaded so in order to keep the lighting correct I had to keep the movement within the superscope.  As far as color goes, the shading effect doesn't really allow for multicolors in the torus very well.  I could change the colors but then you wont even notice the shading at all which would defeat the purpose of the preset.  You want me to make copy with color?  See what it looks like?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For your first experience it is good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">UIUC85, you dont have to use shading and stuff for simple preses...<br />
<br />
only use it when the scope is more important than the flow or background, oh yea, kill that Interferences</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UIUC85</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th October 2003, 07:56</div></div>

<div class="posttext">lol the shading was the major deal with the preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So a techie eeh?<br />
Couldn't care less about how Ã¼ber1337 the shading is.<br />
And it really isn't fair to comment about the rest of the preset if all this is a 'demo' :igor:<br />
<br />
But yes, the preset is crazy &amp; flashy and the torus isn't very noticeable from the background effects.<br />
<br />
You could do the classic 'black borders around a scope' trick. You do it like:<br />
<br />
Your background stuff<br />
   Effect list (ignore / Subtractive)<br />
       Your scope<br />
       buffer save (save, replace)<br />
       a couple of blurs and a fast brite or convolution filter (recommended)<br />
Buffer save (restore, addittive)<br />
<br />
That should make the shading trick &amp; the scope stand out more and the whole scope just stays clean from the background effects.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its already in there.  take off the interference, check &quot;clear every frame&quot; in the effect list, take out the star fields and movements.  I actually prefered it like that myself.  Reminds me of cell shading.  But there isn't much in there with just that so thats why I added the other crap.  You can actually notice the diffuse shading that way too.  I know I've seen other people do distance shading but I haven't seen anyone do shading.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">now this is nice, shading fits perfect for this one.... but on last preset was shading pretty pointless</div></div><hr />
