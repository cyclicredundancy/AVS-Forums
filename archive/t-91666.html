<div class="posttext">hey guys, i've been working on this visualization for awhile, and i guess the total time it took me to make it was 6 hours. 5 of those hours were me striving to get the basic concept i had even better! This proves you can have a great visualization without using SuperScope (it requires FyrewurX)<br />
<br />
If you would like a non-FyrewurX copy, i'll attach it later if you ask, but it doesn't look as good :( <br />
<br />
It looks best like a cinema display, longer than it is tall... and it can look weird too small or too large... just experiement on the size...<br />
<br />
Tell me what you guys think!<br />
<br />
Edit: changed to a version where i added a comment to it</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bah! You can't add an attachment after an edit... try this one...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Don't take it personally!  I personally voted it's okay.  You may think it's cool since you made it.  It just means you're still learning how AVS works.  Try using a variety of Trans and renders.  Just tinker with them; you'll get it. :)<br />
<br />
Remember:  Everybody starts somewhere; so we started out much the same you are right now.  Keep at it!  Don't give up just because of a few votes that say it's bad.  Everybody starts somewhere, but where you finish is determined by when you give up.  Don't give up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I didn't vote because &quot;Terrible&quot; is simply an exaggerated form of what I'd say... I don't exaggerate often.<br />
<br />
Well, that's my vote when I consider the preset is not made from a newbie...<br />
<br />
I'd say you're still in the low middle in the learning scale... You're currently in &quot;No coding, all put-things-together-nicely&quot;... But notice the &quot;nicely&quot; part though.<br />
I'd say that the preset is a start... Long way to go though.<br />
<br />
For the rest of this reply, read cmountford's reply. (Except for voting &quot;okay&quot; part)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmmm... now that i look at it, i can see what you guys are saying about it...<br />
<br />
As you said, i'm not really into the coding part, it's still pretty confusing to me. It looks like coordinate geometry, which i still don't have too much knowledge in. I found one of the flaws was that the oscilliscope star was not mirrored like the rest of the visualization. I fixed this prob a bit, and it looks a bit better, and i'd say it'd be the end of that visualization.<br />
<br />
However, i'd still kinda like to learn how all the coding works, because i look like this :igor: when i see how it all works. If there are any kind of totorials for the coding, i'd kinda like to see it, so that i could help me out if i'm going to create future visualizations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">check the faq (under the main AVS forum-not the preset sub-forum).  Try searching the forum.  Or just set it so it looks at messages from the last year, and then just look through the various posts in the AVS forum &amp; AVS Presets sub-forum.<br />
<br />
I'm working on a guide.  Kaboon is looking at what I have so far-but it's not anywhere near yet.  There's several other people who have either completed or are working on tutorials (again:  check the forums-*hint hint*) :)<br />
<br />
Okay-hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, it's okay for a first time. The coding part is where things get really fun though. Remeber, it's just math. It won't bite. Start small and work your way up. Take apart other's work, see what makes it tick and see how you can make it tick better.<br />
<br />
Just a personal note, I try to avoid things with words like 'psychotic' and 'painfull' and other things like that in the name.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">or check out my tutorial, AVS Primer...it's somewhere in this forum, hiding</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Alright guys, thanks for the advice. I also figured out that the FyrewurX wasn't mirroring well either, and with the oscill star and the FyrewurX working now, it looks better, but ya, i may find somewhere all these tutorials you guys are saying that are hiding somewhere. <br />

How else would you describe it? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero's may be a little harder to find.  But there's one very straightforward message with the last reply on 6-11<br />
<br />
It was started by soulcatalyst.<br />
<br />
And like Atero said, it's not the only thread out there to help you.  Be sure to check out Atero's.  Very good (nod nod).</div></div><hr />
