			<strong>AVS Overlay support</strong><br />
		
		

		I would just like to say that overlay support does work with Active Desktop (so you don't have to completely get rid of it) but you must get rid of any wallpaper that you have setup.  If you don't, you will end up seeing the overlay only behind the icon labels.  <br />
<br />
I can not provide pictures because I seem to being having a weird problem with taking snapshots of an active desktop.  When I pasted the desktop, I basically created a resizable image with a constantly updated background (in sync with the music).  Heck I even saved the image and it and closed off winamp and it still updated to the current background.  <br />
<br />
But having both Active Desktop and AVS overlay on is useful becuase you can hide the icons.  The reason that everyone seems to think it doesn't work with Active Desktop is because AVS is not able to change the background with Active Desktop (which is why I said to have no background on).  It is OK though to have a pattern though.  It might look a little different though.  <br />
<br />
Recommended setup is to have no icons, taskbar autohide, no pattern.  Of course remember to get rid of the background too with Active Desktop on.  This will provide a high-speed, high-resolution, full-screen AVS.  Much faster than the full-screen option in the AVS options.

		of course it works with activeDesktop. just use another &quot;overlay color&quot; which you use as background...<br />
<br />
and to your suggesions (auto-hide taskbar, etc.) : just use win2k and kill the &quot;explorer.exe&quot; process with the task-manager, and what you want is what you get (wywiwyg *g*)

In Win9x, you can edit the System.ini file and change your shell to winamp.exe.  Same result but you have to boot to DOS to get your normal shell back again.<br />
<br />
For in AVS, I have Overlay mode selected then Set destop to color.  Also, my bit depth at the moment is 32bpp.  But it should work fine in 16bpp.<br />
<br />
I see the fullscreen Overlay mode you must be talking about.  It is not as fast as doing an overlay of the desktop.

		Try taking a pic of a window in your house, change everything outside the window to pure black, then select black as the overlay color, change your background to the window... and &quot;LOL&quot;, I think you need active desktop on for this to work :/<br />

Yea, you will need Active Desktop on for this effect to work.  With Active Desktop off, AVS will get rid of the wallpaper.  That is a good idea though.  I never thought of that.
