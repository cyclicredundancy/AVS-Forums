			<strong>A challenge: non-music visualizations</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi all,<br />
Just throwing this out there as a challenge.<br />
<br />
I have a stream of data captured in a CSV file format from some sensors. If you look at the stream of data that I get, it kinda looks like music data.<br />
<br />
I thought it might be cool to create a visualization based on this data.<br />
<br />
Anyone interested in working on this with me? Just PM me.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Graeme.

			<strong>clarification</strong><br />
		
		

		By &quot;non-music visualisation&quot; I meant that the visualisation from the data can be put into a form that can be fed into AVS - and thus produce the different types of moving visualisations.<br />
<br />
Hope that clarifies it a bit :)

Funny you say that. I am getting a contractor to write a CSV to mp3 converter.<br />
<br />
I will keep you updated.

		which reminds me, a friend of mine converted the moves of a chessgame to midi-data. sounded crazy.

		Hm, sounds odd. So, what kind of specific visualization did you want to create to view this data?

Haha, yeah, it does sound odd. Basically it's a portion of a signal obtained from accelerometers of my movement on treadmill. You will notice that it kinda get louder and quicker. That's me walking/running faster on the treadmill.<br />
<br />
When I looked at the data it looked like sound data. I thought it might be cool if that can be a basis for a visualisation.<br />
<br />
In terms of *what* visualisation I am looking for, i dunno - I thought the creative geniuses here could come up with something :)<br />
<br />
I have inputted the mp3 into Winamp and had a look at some of standard visualisations and it looked pretty cool. A unique look of my time on the treadmill!

		that does sound very interesting.. just one thing i noticed that you might want to look at fixing. the entire audio stream is 90 degrees out of phase. i don't know if you know anything about sound, but basically sound waves vary between -1 and +1, 0 being silence. your stream however is zero'd at +1 and your audio peaks downwards towards 0. it's the same as the difference between a sin(x) and cos(x) graph, instead of starting at 0 and going up or down, you're starting at 1 and going down.<br />
<br />
other than that, making a vis for this might be difficult because there are no distinct beats, so a lot of options go down the drain, still, someone might be able to come up with something.

		Good point Mr. Nudge. I'll see what my contractor can do.<br />
<br />
FYI, I've just set up a new open source project on sourceforge. It's being reviewed and will keep you informed when it becomes active.<br />
<br />
Reply if you are interested in being part of the development.

What you have described is not a phase offset, it is an amplitude offset; Phase is the offset of the signal in time.<br />
<br />
For example in avs if you make a superscope with points:<br />
<pre><code><br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
y=sin(x*$pi);<br />
</code></pre><br />
offsetting the amplitude would be<br />
<pre><code><br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
y=sin(x*$pi)+1; //add one to amplitude<br />
</code></pre><br />
...matching what you describe. On the other hand offsetting the phase would be<br />
<pre><code><br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
y=sin(x*$pi+1); //add one radian (about 58 degrees) to phase<br />
</code></pre>
