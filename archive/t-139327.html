      <p class="post-content"><strong>some visuals i did for winamp</strong><br />
      ok great the visuals i made in the older version work in this 2.91 version.<br />
      <br />
      only one trouble i found not anything to do with winamp.<br />
      <br />
      but if i set the full screen mode in win amp to show the visuals at 1280 x 1024 they do not keep up with the songs,. which is what i found on the other win98 computer.<br />
      <br />
      but that was a small computer a pent 2 266, cpu which is slow on anything.<br />
      <br />
      this computer is a p4 2.35 hrz, cpu with a 512 front side bus and 768 mbs of ram and it cant keep the visuals in time, unless it is on an 800 x 600 screen.<br />
      <br />
      i did not think anything would slow down this large of computer but i got so much stuff going on in my visuals<br />
      they just bogg the cpu down when displaying on the larger screen sizes. Sorry.<br />
      <br />
      but if you want to get them anyway they are in a zip file on my music site. you can go through the link for my web site or take this short cut.<br />

      Anyway, sorry to say this but your website is pretty bad. A first visit should give a user a quick idea of what the website is about, content should be split into subjects across several pages and generally you should use less animations, clearer layout and better colors. Because of the information overload, I totally missed the link to your presets even though it was right under my nose.<br />
      And it's best not to put one of those "you are the n'th visitor" counter on your page (especially not at the top) because when you think about it, the only one interested in it is you. You're much better off using a discrete counter (like nedstat).<br />
      <br />
      About your presets, it's clear you haven't done much AVS yet. Everyone is always impressed with the first presets they make, but the fact is, they're mostly created by the built-in effects, and your contribution to the preset is very small. Try creating more special and unique effects. You could take a look at other people's presets and dissect them to learn.<br />
      Of course I don't mean for you to stop AVSing, but just make sure you have something creative and unique when you post it on the internet. You don't have to publish everything you make... and if you only publish the best, then people will have a much better impression of your work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah. Noob presets. We've all made them.<br />
      <br />
      There are some good threads that'll help you get started making more creative presets. Check the AVS FAQ thread and the two Tips and Tricks threads. They're good places to pick up some stuff.</p>

      okey guys i admit it is a first time try at the visuals but i only did them because i could not find any lasor lights that were any good IMHO.. in the ones that came with the download file.<br />
      <br />
      i like the visuals to show the different freq's and volumes of the sounds. and smoothing them out for a smoke effect, or spinning it around to make the viewer ( me ) sick is not my idea of good.<br />
      and if any of you are old enough to remember an old country song. from the 1980's called. " I'm an old hippie and i dont know what to do" thats just about what i am like.<br />
      <br />
      but as for the changing of my web site? ummm? NO.<br />
      <br />
      i got more congrad's for it and un-solicited awards for my site the way it is.<br />
      <br />
      the counter is a led layout for a stereo equlizer which i thought fit the page. if you dont like to read the counter sorry but just scroll past it.<br />
      <br />
      i could make the color for the link a little Brighter for you or put a blinking code to it :D to make the page really flash like vegas.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      for the help on the board for the bogging down of my computer on full screen thanks. but it is as i had said i put to much math computations in the visuals for the cpu to handle a large screen size with this too small pent 4 2.35 hrz cpu<br />
      but it works on the ( mostly normal 800 x 600 ) or smaller.<br />
      <br />
      and i did try to get the image overlay to work but it would not so i gave up on it.<br />
      <br />
      come to think of it maybe other people dont like as much bass as i do? that might have an effect on how they work for you others.<br />
      sorry. :(<br />
      <br />
      how much bass do i like, well i had the waterjar of mine playing and the ripples bounced back to the middle so much it turned into a round ball of silver blue color.. :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">No it's not that the presets are bad, it's just that everyone here has seen the same effects as those so many times. Everyone starts out with it. You will realise when you download other peoples work or if you begin to make more and better stuff.</p>

      sorry as you seen i did not know where to post it as i am new to this?<br />
      <br />
      and from the reactions i believe i am not the only one that posted in the wrong place..<br />
      <br />
      maybe there should be a forum called " Newbie Visuals go Here " :D<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      i also know that the posts were not saying they were bad but only the same old newbie stuff. i just like them and they were not included in the download for winamp.<br />
