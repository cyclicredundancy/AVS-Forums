<div class="posttext">There are many things in Avs that I still don't understand and this is one of them. I would like a better explanation about how to create a shape in a 3d DM.<br />
<br />
The best explanation I could find was in PAK-9's tutorial but I didn't quite get it. The only plane I know is:<br />
                         <br />
                         t=-oz/z1;<br />
                         x=x3*t-ox;<br />
                         y=y1*t-oy;.<br />
<br />
This is PAK-9's explanation about planes other then the one above:<br />
So how do you create other shapes? Well you need to sit down with a pencil and paper, get the mathematical equation for the shape you want to ray trace and solve it to find your ray trace parameter (t). I realize this isnâ€™t much help, but you will need to look elsewhere for a more comprehensive ray tracing guide. <br />
<br />
What's a ray trace?<br />
What's a ray trace parameter?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can't say for sure, but perhaps the reason that Pak's explanation is so vague is because he doesn't need to sit down and think about how to ray trace, it just comes naturally with practice.<br />
<br />
I haven't the slightest idea of how to ray trace either. In fact, I don't even fully understand what it means. If you want to learn, I'm sure the answers (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ray+trace) are out there somewhere. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">As [almost] always,<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org      [/wiki/Raytracing]<br />
should help. [this is the very base of internet research, if you haven't read this article yet: &quot;hrmm&quot;]<br />
<br />
I don't know in which math grade you are by now, it might be a little too advanced for you [it is often for me] check out:<br />

<div class="posttext">I will look over them. They don't have anything on Raytracing on math world one.</div></div><hr />

/slaps forehead<br />
aw sorry, forgot that. I looked for some info on raytracing there for myself some time ago and was disappointed.<br />
but it's a site to remember for later anyway...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's ture, never knew about it. I looked on the http://en.wikipedia.org one and that explination is way over my head. <br />
<br />
Isn't there an avs explination on how to creat a shape in a 3d DM?<br />
<br />
