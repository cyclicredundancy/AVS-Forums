<div class="posttext">This is my second preset. I was just playing around, trying to learn some things. It's ok, but it needs something, don't know what. <br />
<br />
Also included in the zip is the final version of my first preset.<br />
<br />
Check it out!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">wow. now thats cool.<br />
i suggest a little idea.<br />
<br />
why don't you make it move the notes over and make random notes according to their musical scale assignment heh you know like top of scale for treble and middle for beat and bottom for bass heh. now that would look cool.<br />
<br />
also great job on the Equalizer Plus. looking forward to Equalizer Negative. heh pun intended.</div></div><hr />

Well, i actually had the same idea about the notes, but as i am just a beginner at this stuff, i didn't know how to do it. Now if you want to include your idea in a remix, i would love to see it. :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good words on my first preset. I'm trying to learn some different things now, and here is my third one, just messing around, ... uhh ... better make that just meshing around. :-)<br />
<br />
How is it for a beginner, is it crap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm have you tryed the move function in dyna move?<br />
and in response to the crap thing i think its nice. and better yet meet me at Http:\\visualnoobs.bravehost.com\chat.html and we can chat there. because i know more about dms then i do scopes.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Regarding dms, i have a few taken from tutorials, i just tinker with them until i get what i want. Is there a collection of example dms i could use in my presets? I don't want to steal anything from someone else.<br />
<br />
Here is my latest preset, still working on it, but it's looking cool. Try it, you'll like it!! :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here you go man. fresh off the computer took me sometime to figure out the math for the lines tho. heh the dm is your movement control. i tryed to change the getosc settings on the notes and well it blew up in my face so i changed only the color of the osc at the bottom and included the movement and the lines. i hope you like it. sorry couldn't make the treble cleft thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">DarracottDude</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th May 2006, 22:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">WOW! That looks really good. The addition of the lines is a huge improvement. Now why didn't i think of that? The movement also helps the overall look. Many thanks.<br />
<br />
I'll get better in time, meanwhile i'm having a shitload of fun. :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You could add more notes in the preset. I dont know much about them, but here's something good:<br />

<div class="posttext">I don't know much about notes either, or how to draw the many shapes in avs. Thanks for the link, lots of ideas for new presets in those images. :-)<br />
<br />
/edit: I have a font called Music Fun.ttf, with lots of music related characters. If anyone is interested, i can zip it and post it here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok this you might like. i've cleaned up the code a bit and added a more precise beat detection.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Damn, that is awesome! I like it a lot. I thought my original had some potential, but i wasn't able to optimize it. You did a great job, thanks.</div></div><hr />
