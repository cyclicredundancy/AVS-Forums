<div class="posttext">Yeah, u know what Aminita Muscara is? It's a hallucinaginic mushroom. Not as psychoative as psilocybin mushrooms and supposedly a much less &quot;pleasant&quot; experience, but hallucinaginic none the less. U can find them growing wild in many places as they are still legal to grow, not to consume in the US. I remember seeing them all over the place in monterey, CA.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Amanita Muscaria is AFAIK tha red mushroom with white dots, dunno how it's called in English. Called &quot;muhara&quot; here. It's poisonous, but not deadly, and if treated in a way can be eaten quite safely, but it's not worth the effort cos there are much better tasting shrooms around.<br />
