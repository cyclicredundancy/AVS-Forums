<div class="posttext">Firstly Hello :) <br />
<br />
What an impressive program this is, so impressive that I downloaded the newest version a few hours ago to find out that I now have a slight problem with my AVS window.<br />
<br />
Yes, shocking I know. So I thought that I should turn to the source for some advice.<br />
<br />
The problem is as follows (In as much detail as possible):<br />
<br />
When I load up Winamp (Newest Version 5.35) Everything looks ok. I proceed to listen to my music as normal and the changing of Visualizations is not a problem, but when I open a Visualization using the 'Dock in AVS Editor' option and exit, it leaves the AVS window the original size, but the actual Visualization shrinks to match the size of the 'Docked' Visualization window. Resizing this window does nothing and changing Visualizations does nothing either, as does returning to the 'Docked AVS Editor' screen and back. However, closing the AVS Window and re-opening it does fix this problem temporarily, but it's a bit of a hassle to do that every time I wish to change AVS's. This has never happened to me before this version, but 3 days ago I updated my graphics card to it's current one and hadn't run my older version since then.<br />
<br />
I did try the search but I couldn't find anything of relevance to this particular problem.<br />
<br />
Ok, here are my technical specs (Don't laugh, lol):<br />
<br />
-Intel Pentium 4 1.80Ghz Processor<br />
-512Mb RAM<br />
-NVIDIA GeForce MX 6200 256Mb<br />
-Windows XP Professional With Service Pack 2<br />
-DirectX 9.0C<br />
-Winamp 5.35<br />
-Installed with custom settings (With everything checked)<br />
-I am the only user on this computer so I'm fairly certain I only installed for me only<br />
<br />
If I missed anything, I am very sorry, please let me know...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
      - pAmpH</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If it's like that (attached image), I'm experiencing the same problem, except mine is from coming out of fullscreen mode.<br />
<br />
Either way, this sounds more like a technical issue than with an AVS Troubleshoot... Either way.. My specs as well.<br />
<br />
intel Centrino Duo @ 1.6GHz x2<br />
1024 MB Ram<br />
Intel Mobile 945GM Express Chipset<br />
Windows Vista 32-bit Home Premium + all updates to this point<br />
DirectX 10.0<br />
WinAMP 5.35<br />
Only person who I let use my laptop is me. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's the exact same problem. See on the right side and the bottom how you can see what was behind it, when you right click on that section does it not recognise it as part of the AVS window or not? (It doesn't on mine, it just thinks that there's nothing there)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i also experience that problem here when coming from fullscreen.<br />
but pAmph, can't you just edit the vis without docking it? shouldn't be too much of a problem then.<br />
<br />
i guess it has something to do with the recent minor changes in avs, since i never had this with older versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">pAmpH</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th June 2007, 08:04</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I guess I could do that, but I prefer to dock it because it seems to run a bit faster. I guess I can live with it... Maybe it can try to be fixed in a newer version? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help anyway :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you can always switch to an older version of WA, of course.<br />
i think all this last editing took place in the 5.2x versions so anything before that should work just fine [except for the usual crashing issues of course].<br />
haven't tested it though so don't take my word for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">pAmpH</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st July 2007, 10:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I could try that, but I'm now pretty much used to not 'docking' it.<br />
<br />
If it keeps annoying me I'll try a slightly earlier version, thanks for the suggestion :)</div></div><hr />
