		Just a little shameless self-promotion here. I'm new to the scene but my first pack has recieved some nice reviews from staff and better reviews from users so it might be worth checking out. Keep in mind that this selection includes a few presets that i personally wasn't proud of, but have some redeeming quality or another that makes them - if nothing else - of some interest to newer AVS preset publishers like myself.<br />
<br />
More importantly, this is a request for feedback.<br />
<br />
I've had some nice comments, but i'd also like some creative criticism from more those here with more experience. What do people like?<br />
<br />
Any requests are also welcome, but i am a very busy boy these days so you might have to be patient.

		Come on people. I've had lots of downloads and great public ratings so i know people like my stuff. All i'm asking for is a little feedback.

		DAMN...You must be one patient sonofabitch to get some of that code syncing.<br />
<br />
Seriously, your skills are t3h aw3s0m3, but about half of your presets are noobish in style.  Sort of where I am :/

		Atero: That sounds familiar for a lot of us, me included. Although I think I'm getting somewhere with the new pack.<br />
<br />
jim: I'll review your pack as soon as I get home. No Winamp at school unfortunately. :down:

		I know these some really newbie stuff in there. That's 'cause it's real old. I just threw them in because they have a &quot;something&quot; i liked. But what can i say? It is only my first pack, after all. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly, though, it's the ones I almost didn't include that I get the good comments for. Go figure.<br />
<br />
O_o .oO(?)<br />
<br />
My next release will focus on the nicer stuff. When I look back at it now i'm almost embarrassed of some of them. I try to reassure myself with the fact that i am going for originality here.
