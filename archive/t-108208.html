      <p class="post-content">I hate conforming with the masses but I agree that AVS forums should stick to avs. The post wasn't too far off topic and it was fairly amusing but it doesn't really belong here IMHO.<br />
      <br />
      The point is that we here love AVS and not milkdrop, any 'milkdrop is better than AVS' posts or any posts claiming that there is something better than AVS are going to be met with hostility. We like AVS because it is the most versatile, custom codeable, visualiser out there, milkdrop is something completely different, it is not what I would call customisable at all and it is ugly in my opinion (interface and visualisations).<br />
      <br />
      Basically: Don't pimp milkdrop, it just annoys people.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The thread is not about MilkDrop being better than AVS etc. I only said that for a joke at the start as reference to threads months ago about it that is all done and dusted. Search for them if you wish. It was a sarcastic reference not a plug for MilkDrop. Geez.<br />
      <br />
      I am really sorry you people cannot see that. I was only making a joke.<br />
      <br />
      If the story was about AVS (or any other plug-in) I would have posted it on the MilkDrop forums maybe we are just more open minded there I dunno.:confused: :confused:<br />
      <br />
      Hell I do not mind having another MD vs AVS vs all over plugins discussion but this is not what this thread is about. CAn you really not understand that?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reason that we have reacted like this is because of what was implied in the post, not what was directly said. I'm sorry to have to disagree with you but the overwhelming tone of the first post is 'Milkdrop is better than AVS'.<br />

      </blockquote>It may not have been mean't that way but those sentences come across as 'AVS=crap'. It seems to me like you are trying to get one up on AVS. That last post seemed a bit insulting as well, fair enough some of us overreacted a little but there was a reason.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well it is a funny story yes :)<br />
      But the whole avs vs the whole other world discussion is getting SO old! You just don't want to admit that avs beats the crap out of anything else and your only weapon against it seems to be that you moan and complain about the speed, and that's all you got!<br />

      <p class="post-content">in fact, the only productive thing to get out of this post is combining the strengths of each vis plugin to create something new, advanced.... would be a lot easier of course, if avs (for instance) was open source.<br />
      <br />
      the thing i dont understand, i remember there were threads in this forum suggesting to make avs open source, but the official always denied this... on the other hand the same people brought us an open-sourced NSIS. comments against an open-sourced avs were many differing versions and sort of chaos. well, i dont see chaos in the NSIS development, so where is the problem?</p>

      Seriously I don't see what the fuss is about. Someone gets laid thanks to Milkdrop, posts a funny story, teh w00t :). The thread was cool (Milkdrop is only mentioned once), and some people here might pick up a thing or two :cool: ). No reason to start bashing Rovastar or Milkdrop.<br />
      Oh and I wouldn't underestimate being a moderator. It might sound really cool, being able to edit and delete things, but it's also a responsibility. If a bad thread stays up, people complain that the mod sucks. If something gets deleted, it's the mod who gets yelled at for being too strict.<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>It would work if we were organised about it and if the source was released only to a small group of us, besides that there aren't that many coders around who care to make changes to AVS. I don't think it would fork quickly or even at all if we all worked together.

      <br />
      Open source can easily turn into open chaos. Everyone wants stuff to be open source now-a-days.<br />
      <br />
      The real problem with AVS IMHO is that it may be better to 'start from the beginning' and write a new peice of code from scrach utilizing 3d cards etc thus getting the speed benifits etc. You cannot really 'patch' these on easily as it will not be all the efficent from what I undestand.<br />
      <br />
      But if Nullsoft ppl are not working any more on AVS then the code in a way is going to waste.............</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I think you are right. To the best of my understanding, just pathcing on 3D accelerated code would slow it down rather than speed it up, I'd expect it would be a lot better to redesign the whole thing from the ground up.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>isnt this contrary to the definition of "open source"<br />
      now, i TOTALLY concur that it would fork QUICKLY but i believe once the noobs were put in their place, and the smart ppl got organized or (even better/more appliciible to me) dont fuck with the code in the first place, becuase we would only screw it up<br />
      <br />
      however, even w/ all those disadvantages, the fact that we could make this project/pastime/hobbie/employment:) even more effective and user friendly (not in a lameass way, you know what i mean (like constants)) outweighs anything stateing why we shouldnt<br />
      <br />
