      i've been working away at this programe for a year now and i have about 100 avs's. i want to become a VJ and i'm not sure who to turn to for the first critical step of setting up a real avs portable comp with everything compatable for a live concert. MP3's streeming is easy but what about line-in? i need a solid base befor i take on this market. has any one done this befor succsessfuly?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Well...</strong><br />
      Here's what little I have fugured out.<br />
      <br />
      I use two graphics cards in an athlon 850, the main card is a 3dprophet II MX which displays on the monitor and the second card (ATI MACH 64 TV_OUT) displays to a TV/Projector/etc. I run the AVS in a window that fills the entire Tv/projector etc. That way i get better frame rates than fullscreen and i can edit the Presets live at any time while they run.<br />
      <br />
      As for line in, you're gonna need either an rca or stereo-jack wire. You hook i9t into a mixer (or other signal source), and select line in as your input (CTRL-L then type linein:// (i'm not quite sure if thast's right, could be //:line in and I'm too lazy to check :)))<br />
      <br />
      I've acquired a cordless keyboard and mouse to make things easier as well as cleaning all the useless programs off of my system. You want to make sure any power-down (Hard discs etc.) features are disabled as well as the screensavers, obviously.<br />
      <br />
      I bought a 100ft length of shielded cable and hooked un a stereo jack at one end and rca jacks on the other, this gives me my line-in feed (stereo jack to computer, rca to mixer) It's a good idea to have adapters of all kinds (i.e. rca to stereo) available, just in case you need em. I also picked up 20ft s-video and rca-video cables, to be able to set up the projector farther away from the computer itself.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      What I'm looking for now is a good deal on a projector.. heheheh</p>

      Hi dude...<br />
      <br />
      I'm a V.J here in Sydney, and have worked at venues which could accomodate me with Projectors (yep im a VJ who doesn't own a projector). I use a CorioGen Eclpise as my scan-converter with a p3 700, but have never run a line-in into winamp from a DJs deck... i'll be trying this soon though, now that i've read how to do it:)<br />
      <br />
      If you want to be a V.J its best to use all types of programs including LAVA, Arkaos V.J, Dancer DNA, GioFx. Also a good idea to know how to make original AVI's and Flash files for the Club Promoters, promoting them. They always love this and you need to sell them this idea also.<br />
      <br />
      AVS is a BIG part of what i use. The Picture render function (for LOGOS) and the AVI render function used in conjunction with some good presets can be mind-boggling, even at 640 X 480(32bit) with Pixel Doubling on. Frame rates could always be better, yes, but bearable at 25 to 50 fps depending on complexity and if AVIs' are rendered or not. If you want to use AVIs' in AVS make them very short. I have many hours of visuals from ppl like Brian Dressel of O.V.T and rip 3 second bits here and there to overlay into AVS. If you want to do this make sure the AVS is at 380 X 240 (or thereabouts) otherwise FrameRates will be very bad.<br />
      <br />
      Another idea for you would be to have some good originally mixed video visuals playing simultaneously while your pumping your PC. Follow link for some cool tapes to start your collection. <a href="http://vaporware.com.au/" target="_blank">http://vaporware.com.au/</a><br />
      <br />
      This way you can switch over when your PC misbehaves or when you want to change what you are presenting. Of course you gotta have everything rigged up accordingly....this is one way in keeping the continuity.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Anyways just thought i'd let you know what some of us are doing and how we learn to improvise in our VJ'ing conquest.<br />
      <br />
      Goodluck and hope you get into it on at least some level :)...</p>
