<div class="posttext">Can anyone explain to me what the variable for it is like z = ??<br />
<br />
I know its user defined but I dont know what it is or how to use it. So can anyone help me out her</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Usually z is used for the z axis. It just makes sence. :p<br />
<br />
It's used to make things shrink or grow depending on how close they are to the viewing plane.<br />
<br />
Because it's a user defined variable you have to reset it for each point.<br />
<br />
Help any?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes, But whats the variable?<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's anything you want it to be.  The z-axis thing is used like this:<br />
x1=...;<br />
y1=...;<br />
z1=...;<br />
z=z1+dst;<br />
x=x1/z;<br />
y=y1/z;<br />
<br />
That'll give you the proper projection for most any shape you want to do (unless it diverges).  dst is the distance from the center to the point farthest away from the center.  For example, in a cube the farthest point is going to be &lt;1,1,1&gt; (the corner where x=1, y=1, and z=1).  So the distance is sqrt(1^2+1^2+1^2)=sqrt(1+1+1)=sqrt(3).</div></div><hr />

You made it sound very much like they were. <br />

<br />
How can you not know how to use a user defined variable or what it is? The whole point of a user defined variable is that you decide how to use it and you decide what it is and what it does. (Sorry I couldn't find a way to say that without it sounding a bit harsh...) That makes it sound like you think they are predefined to some extent, otherwise your question makes no sense.<br />
<br />
I assume that you understand that t=t+0.05; just increases t by 0.05 every frame (if it is in the frame box). With z, you just have to define it for all of the points, either by making it the same across the frame or by setting it to be different for each point by using 'i' in someway or by using a different method. <br />
<br />
Don't forget that you can define (almost) any number of variables and do practically whatever you want with them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A user-defined variable that is nevertheless consistently used across presets from different authors (like 'z') means that it's used in a well known technique. Read about it by simply searching the web (Google is your friend).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Once again I make some usless post :)<br />
<br />
Although I was wondering, Does Z change the same for Dynamic Movments By that I mean do I have to define it for certain movements?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's a user defined variable. You always have to define it if you're going to use it. If not, don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">ryan</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th October 2002, 07:38</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Ok let me rephrase this again.<br />

Say Im going to use it, What would I use to make a simple 3D dynamic movment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">idiot: you're completely asking the wrong question. It's not about the variable 'z', it's about understanding 3D projection techniques. If you don't know how to do that, using 'z' won't help you one bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Idiot, you have already been shown how to make a simple 3D DM in this thread.<br />
<br />
As well as that I think that you are trying to apply too much milkdrop logic to AVS. You have to learn it from scratch.. they are very different things and you can't transfer very much from one to the other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, idiot, I'll try to put it into Milkdrop terms for you:<br />
<br />
z variables, usually more then 1, are simply placeholders for values later put into large equations to generate 3d movements...  such as shrinking the wave when it gets &quot;further away&quot; (it just gets smaller).<br />
<br />
No one can five you the equations cause they'll always be different.. if you want the conversion equations.. well.. you have them already as you sent them to me.</div></div><hr />

the guy chose his nick and now he faces the conseqences, but he can always change, if he want to, to change your nick, then just pm sawg and tell him that you wanna change your nick to (whatever you want), just make sure that the nick is not taken, if not then consider it almost done</div></div><hr />
