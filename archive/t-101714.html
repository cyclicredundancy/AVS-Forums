      I've been trying to set up the overlay mode for winamp, and even after reading every post I could find on the subject, its still not working. I have the overlay mode and set desktop to color options checked. I disabled active desktop and my wallpaper and its still not working. Any suggestions? Oh...I also resized my display to every possible size I could...still no help there either. My display is currently on 1024 X 768 (for both monitors), with and NVIDIA GeForce card on the primary and my old Matrox Millennium on the secondary display.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for any suggestions!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I believe both those cards let you decide to which display to send the overlay signal. Is that perhaps not set?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's probably a driver issue caused by using two video cards. I know nVidia's drivers have extensive overlay controls in the advanced display options, so maybe you should look there?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the suggestion, however under the properties for the Matrox I couldn't find anything for the overlay mode. Under my GeForce card, the overlay mode wouldn't let me change any options. Is this something I have to set in WinAmp? Maybe I'm just missing something obvious.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nope it's definitely a driver issue, has nothing to do with AVS or Winamp.</p>
