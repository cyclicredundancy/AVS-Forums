      i think a good idea would be to put a save feature on the superscope and DM editing thingies, so you could make a superscope or DM and save it in the editing window instead of saving a whole preset :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Do you know that you can add entire presets to your preset?<br />
      <br />
      You can save a preset (with just one effect) to, say, a folder named 'template' (that's what I have).<br />
      Later, add your saved effect to the preset you're working on.<br />
      <br />
      It will be added in an Effect List. Just move it out of the effect list and remove that empty effect list.</p>

      <p class="post-content">wotl: i do that too, but it would be pretty nifty to be able to add your own ssc's/dms to the preset lists they have.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree too, but I was informing him of a workaround.<br />
      <br />
      An option (or hack) to add your own 'examples' would be great for the T2, SSC, DM, Comment and perhaps the Movement too.</p>

      <br />
      I can still remember moving lots of SSCs or Texers in and out of effect lists to try ordering them differently without it being a massive chore... but it was still fairly chorey.
