      <p class="post-content">Err sure... but the example preset I posted wasn't very good because it generated the white/black mask realtime. You could just as well use a simple bitmap which I think would be faster (a 1x2 pixel bitmap). You also need some basic understanding of coordinate systems (polar vs rectangular) to create presets that won't look squashed when squashed :) (unless you don't squash the screen, but rather cut off the left/right or top/bottom edges).<br />
      <br />
      By the way, this forum has a neat little feature called 'Private Messages'. That way you don't have create a topic that is not intended for 99.9% of the people here :) Click a user's name, and then click the link "Send &lt;username&gt; a private message". If you receive any, this'll be shown at the top of the global forum screen when you're logged in.</p>
