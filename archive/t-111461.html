      I created VU-meters presets. Currently I'm working on 4 more. Please tell me - what do you want' see in similar presets. If only I can - I'lll create.</p>

      <p class="post-content">wdym, 'after a regular set of 3d functions will appear'? cos you can code 3d yourself quite easily...look around - jheriko, unconed, nic, me, pak-9, and so on - it's been done a million times before. just check out some other people's 3d code and work it out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just out of interest gourmet, have you seen anyone elses presets. There is a lot more that AVS is capable of than just oscilloscopes and VU meters.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sure guys. I downloaded many presets and several my favorites are 3D (from UnConeD, El-Vis and others). But that is not exactly what I mean when tell "3D". I worked with several professional programs like 3DS MAX, Houdini, Poser, LightWave and others. Even I did programming on OpenGL. I have HUGE experience in C and I am (Ok... was... - now I'm in business) sertified C++ developer. From this I dont' wanna translate my ideas about 3D objects to 2D space manualy. This limits greately. If AVS will contain regular 3D set of functions - I'll show what I can.<br />
      <br />
      Returning to VU-meters. I finished 3 more presets - BatmanRadio, ClassicSilver and VapourMachine. Currently I'm working on another one - ClassicLCD. After it will be finished I'll upload new set.</p>

      Just kidding.<br />
      <br />
      Personally that exact sort of problem is what I find so cool about AVS, it can be really difficult to make really impressive and technically complex effects without annihilating your framerate in the process. The limits of AVS are what make it so interesting to me. If it had OpenGL like capability then any pleb could quite easily create anything which would be really impressive in AVS right now.<br />
      Thats one of the reasons that I dislike WildTangent, OpenGL is so damn powerful and they waste it by doing the same thing over and over again. Just like a really crap AVS artist does now with the more basic effects and just like they would if AVS was that powerful.

      <p class="post-content">Heck, just create DOOM-III looking rooms in AVS. Let them be shined by moving light sources with volumetric shadows and with 3D textures on walls... (returning joke back).<br />
      <br />
      And imagine HOW MANY excellent presets could appear if only OpenGL would be here. I didnt' try MilkDrop but looked at screenshots (I dont' know - it uses DirectX or GL - doesnt' matter). And this is not all. 3DS MAX has many built in features but to create good graphics (and then change it if needed) you have to be videographer, not lamer.<br />
      <br />
      I greately imagine what I can create in AVS in 3D space. Not only possible low framerate limits me. Required time too. I do VU-meters for fun not for sport. :-)</p>
