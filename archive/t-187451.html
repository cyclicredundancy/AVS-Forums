		Strange. Although AVS tends to crash every now and then anyway. Re-installing would be best I think. - Don't forget to backup all presets, skins and other stuff you've downloaded for it.

		Note that Metaballs 3D &amp; Tentacles 3D ape's always crash your winamp if you're using windows XP. They do work if they are already in a preset which was done before, but trying to add a new Metaballs or tentacles ape will result in a crash.<br />
It's a bug which the author Steven Wittens (aka UnConeD) has not fixed and last time i heard doesn't want to fix them. Not that it matters though, they are really stupid apes anyway :p
