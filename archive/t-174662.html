<div class="posttext">Hey yall, first time poster<br />
<br />
Question.<br />
<br />
Im a dj and i want to have visualizations playing on  my laptop through a lcd project behind me. I found one of the coolest looking visuals i could find called Whacko AVS V - Speeder 3K its amazing! <br />
<br />
But my real question is, anyone know any GOOD visuals to use for this? for enhancing the dance floor? adding depth? i want something so sick that people will look at it and be like &quot;FUCK YEA DUDE!!&quot; ya know?<br />
<br />
Also is there a way to import a logo or something into a visual and have it in the background or something or even have the logo go to the beat like pulsing?<br />
<br />
Hope yall can help!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much,<br />
<br />
Dave</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">also, sorry to jump in, but is there a way to enable it so the visualization only appears on the lcd projector instead of your actual desktop? like i know im my tv lab class, we use real player to play our clips from the computer to the tv and we dont even have to maximize the screen in realplayer to have it appear full screen on the show. <br />
<br />
does anyone follow me? ;)<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well i don't know about the Vj stuff, but as far as AVS goes, there is a Picture Render and even better Picture Render II that both come with wa5 avs install ;)<br />
<br />
Also if you are planning on using other people's work, you have to ask permission first, the author of that particular preset is UnConeD aka Steven Wittens (which you probably already knew, but anyway...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">philly: don't hijack topics. Search for 'overlay mode'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If I understand correctly, you want AVS to run fullscreen on your second monitor and keep your first monitor as it is... This question has been asked many times before, search through the troubleshooting subforum if you can find your answer there.<br />
And for good visuals, go here (http://browse.deviantart.<br />
com/visualization/avspresets/?order=17).<br />
(all AVS presets submitted to www .deviantart . com sorted by maximum downloads)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok. i am doing the same thing. <br />
the only problem that I know and it can appear as far as I know, will be the speed of the AVS.<br />
because if you want a god picture, or logo, you need to have a good resolution, but for good resolution you need very good computer.</div></div><hr />
