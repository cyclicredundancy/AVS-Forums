      Ok here's the first thing I could think of that I felt needed improving. Moving Particle.<br />
      <br />
      We should be able to control more than just size, distance from centre etc.<br />
      <br />
      Why not getting control over the the movement - as well as the random circling around the centre, why not stuff like going around the edges, or bouncing off stuff like a pingpong ball - or better still being able to programme its path of movement.<br />
      <br />
      Why not also being able to control its shape, perhaps even being able to draw your own moving particle.<br />
      <br />
      And also how about a few more on beat effects, such as on beat fade, on beat disappear, or on beat change colour?<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure this one isn't too hard to alter for AVS version 3.0!</p>
