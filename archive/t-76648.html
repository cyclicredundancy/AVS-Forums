<div class="posttext">Ok here's the first thing I could think of that I felt needed improving.  Moving Particle.<br />
<br />
We should be able to control more than just size, distance from centre etc.<br />
<br />
Why not getting control over the the movement - as well as the random circling around the centre, why not stuff like going around the edges, or bouncing off stuff like a pingpong ball - or better still being able to programme its path of movement.<br />
<br />
Why not also being able to control its shape, perhaps even being able to draw your own moving particle.<br />
<br />
And also how about a few more on beat effects, such as on beat fade, on beat disappear, or on beat change colour?<br />
<br />
I'm sure this one isn't too hard to alter for AVS version 3.0!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm maybe I've jumped the gun a little...<br />
I just saw my suggestion already on the Sticky post, so you guys have probably already heard all of the above already...<br />
<br />
Oh well, who the hell is gonna flame me about it?<br />
We're all nice guys here......;)</div></div><hr />
