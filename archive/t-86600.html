      <p class="post-content"><strong>Are these beat-detection presets worth publishing?</strong><br />
      What do you think of the 22 attached presets?<br />
      <br />
      Which are Good?<br />
      Which are Bad?<br />
      <br />
      Are they worth publishing?<br />
      <br />
      Are they original etc.<br />
      <br />
      Any Feedback?<br />
      <br />
      If there is enough good feedback I will consider publishing my first AVS pack.<br />

      </blockquote>yeah they're original, for a nickel,<br />
      i know this is your first pack and these are typical n00b presets but c'mon, "thematrix" is the most simplest preset in the world, have you downloaded othe n00b avs pack, if you don't do that, i don't mean to be harsh on you but every n00b do these kinds of presets,<br />
      <br />
      if you want to make original n00b presets then remeber these thing<br />
      <br />
      1. a steady base preset is always needed, meaning that you have to have a clear idea of what you wanna do<br />
      <br />
      2. movements, it's ok to use the roto blitter &amp; blitter feedback, but the problem is that you get a very simple kind of movement,<br />
      <br />
      3. pleasantness, the viewers of the presets don't always like strobes<br />
      <br />
      4. diversity, a typical n00b mistake is that you do the same preset but with some change, this is caused by using smae trans efects, like mirrors, although mirrors can help, it sometimes do the presets look the same<br />
      <br />
      5. don't steal other ppl's work and if you gonna use other ppl's work, then credit them for it

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I hope you didn't think you could actually get away with using Zen-X's 'scopes without giving credit, did you? Especially since The Rings that Talked IS a default preset...<br />
      And that Fireworks one (FyrewurX w/Roto Blitter) has been done to death. The other ones are just throwing together effects and hoping for something good.<br />
      <br />
      and anoher typicle n00b mistak is to use word n00b constantly and n00b not use coorect n00b gramar or n00b spelling n00b n00b n00b n00b n00b...</p>
