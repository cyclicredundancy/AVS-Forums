<div class="posttext">Again I am asking the AVS community for help with Spectrum Analyzer  type AVS For a skin.<br />
http://www.quad-helix.com/warp.htm<br />
This skin has built in AVS and also many more new features.  It would be awesome if You have made any AVS presets to post em here new or old to go into this pack that will ship with this Skin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I say go with Tugg's new one.  That preset rocks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The preset UIUC85 mentioned is still 'under development', but after it's finished and you want to use it just say the word :) Though it is going to be in my Extra Dimension pack also...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sweet you guys!!  Anyone have any objection if i look around winamp/deviantart and use your presets if i give you credit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th January 2004, 09:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">For me, it's fine as long as you credit me, leave the original comment in, and preferably a link to where you downloaded the pack as well. <br />
<br />
That is, if you think my work is good enough for you ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th January 2004, 23:32</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">You still need to ask the author i think since this is a case where you just want to add the preset to the collection, it's a whole different story than just remixing...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">As always feel free to use any of my stuff.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you ask el-vis if you can use the white/bluespectrum presets that he made.<br />
<br />
Nice skin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here is the skin with Tuggummis AVS please keep sending em in this skin I think will be a major downloader, also I wish there was a way to directly connect a AVS preset to a button on a skin.  Any brains out there?<br />
here is another demoWARP (http://www.quad-helix.com/warp6.wal)<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, which part of: &quot;The preset is still 'under development', but after it's finished and you want to use it just say the word&quot; You did not understand?<br />
<br />
a) The preset is not finished<br />
b) I have received no kind of note from you asking for permission<br />
<br />
Do not distribute unfinished versions of it!<br />
And since the skin is most likely to be finished long before that preset is, i don't want you to distribute it at all along your skin, please remove it if you have and don't do it in the future thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Yathosho</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th February 2004, 12:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">haha, was wondering about that myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">QuadHeliX</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th February 2004, 17:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Tuggummi I am not distributing it!!  Its not even with  the skin.   AVS has to be in a seperate download program.... Why did you post the AVS preset here?  I am probably going to look around somemore for the offcial preset that will be distributed with Warp.  Something like  Unconed's- Siesmogrid, unless you finish this up in say 2 mos or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th February 2004, 18:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Presets are posted on the preset forum often for comments, to show off a complicated work in progress, to get feedback, etc.<br />
<br />
Just because something is posted doesn't mean it is finished, or even that it can be redistributed.<br />
My presets have the terms at the bottom of the comment which is included with every preset. Most other authors do this too, so I suggest you look there first. If they are unspecific, ask the author just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th February 2004, 06:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i don't use modern skins, so i couldn't actually clarify wheter or not you were distributing it in this skin and i don't even know how moderns skins work in terms of can something be installed as i.e. avs presets along with it?<br />
Anyway when you say: &quot;Here is the skin with Tuggummis AVS&quot; You give me the impression that the preset indeed is within this skin.<br />
<br />
Well i don't think it is going to be finished anytime soon, so you might look something else to replace that. If you don't know: I have &quot;quit&quot; (just doing one little update to my last pack) doing avs and i use or even watch avs less every passing day so it takes time...</div></div><hr />

Cheers to you and all you may do.</div></div><hr />
