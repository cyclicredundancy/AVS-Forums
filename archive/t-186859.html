Zipped only because yahoo doesn't allow files of unknown extentions...anyway, the one to look for is 3d Blazing Flower 6(the latest). I should mention a few things about this:<br />
<br />
1) The effect you get depends entirely on the type of music you're listening to. I've got a lot of ambient and orchestral, so that's mainly what I tested it with, but also some rock too. Just about every aspect of the visualisation reacts to the music in some way.<br />
<br />
2) In this latest version I added the distance fading(3 more calculations, one for each color) and modified the movement of the lightsources slightly(they're closer to the scope and move more).<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous notes:<br />
-The intensity of the lightsources are derived from getspec() calls, the Blue is affected by the entire left channel, green by the entire right, and red by the top 60% of the center channel. So in mostly bass-driven songs with little treble(although cymbals/hihats/etc do affect it) you won't see much red. Usually the difference between the left &amp; right channels isn't all that much, so you probably won't see it unless you're listening to something with extreme panning.<br />
-I'm still looking for a good way to get an anti-aliasing effect. You can see a sharp line at the bottom edge of the 'flower', especially in lower resolutions. I tried using blur, but that didn't give the effect I wanted and really didn't do much more than lower the framerate.<br />
-Also, regardless of the resolution I can't get it to run any faster than 40fps, although in fullscreen(1152x864) with pixel doubling it doesn't lose too much(31.4 on my machine).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Rather than have to wait till it draws the flower (which takes a looong time) why not spare the viewer from such agony and set t on init to something higher?<br />
<br />
Well anyway, don't like it so much, but then again i don't listen to any of those types of music :p</div></div><hr />
