      <p class="post-content"><strong>a few things...</strong><br />
      could anyone help me do any of the following things??<br />
      <br />
      1) mix between avs presets, other avs presets, maybe other pluggins and videos, in real time. (one monitor for mixing, one for output).<br />
      <br />
      2) "render and record" avs pluggins or preferably a mix between them and other stuff as in 1. e.g. slows down music enough to get a decent frame rate at a large resolution, then saves this to disk as an avi or something.<br />
      <br />
      3) produce "avs cds": these would be cds with several audio tracks, but also a load of avs's on them. the avs's would change at specified times throughout the cd. e.g. you could have 2 or 3 avs's per audio track.<br />
      <br />
      4) simpler version of the above: create a program to swap through a few specified avs's at given times. e.g. in a demo after install.<br />
      <br />
      maybe these things need a winamp plugin for premiere...??<br />
      <br />
      thanks for any help<br />
