      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS avi rendered crashes immediately</strong><br />
      I've recently bought a new pc.<br />
      On my old one, the avi renderer crashed when switching avi files without disabling it first, or switching to another preset that also used the avi renderer (which seems to be a common bug, i did search), but it did work so if i can get it back to that state, i would be happy.<br />
      <br />
      Now on my new one, it doesn't work at all. I've tried both Winamp 2.95, which i used on my old machine, and the latest Winamp 5.<br />
      2.95 crashes immediately upon loading the preset, 5 stops responding. Actually, 5 often stops responding when avs is loaded regardless of the preset...<br />
      <br />
      System specs:<br />
      OLD:<br />
      Pentium3 500 MhZ, 256 MB RAM, GeForce 4000 something. Lots and lots of video codecs.<br />
      NEW:<br />
      Pentium 4 3.4 GhZ, 1 GB RAM, GeForce 6600 GT. Latest version of Media Player and the latest K-lite Codec Pack.<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone have a clue what might cause the problem? I'd really appreciate it, because some of my best presets used avi's.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks.<br />
      <br />
      That did help me fix the problem... because that avi player gave me an error message instead of a crash :p <i>Could not find RGB decompressor for avi file</i><br />
      <br />
      Apparently, the codec pack i installed didn't have the right divx codec to make the avi renderer work properly, even though all my avi files did play in all media players.<br />
      But i installed divx 6 from the official divx website and now it works properly.<br />
      <br />
      I feel stupid :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">all the more so since many codec "packs" contain a lot of malware.</p>
