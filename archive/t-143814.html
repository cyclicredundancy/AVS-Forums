		I created this preset awhile back hoping I would later get around to making something good from it...<br />
<br />
I named it nullsoft b/c it originally had their logo in it but now its basicly a black blob leaving a kinda fuzzy orange trail....<br />
<br />
but when I made it i thought that trail looked really cool and if there was some way to remove the source from view but keep the ever changing trail it would be pretty cool looking<br />
<br />
But alas.... as much as I have tried nothing good ever comes out.  So I thought maybe one of you guys could do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; and I accidentally gave away my real name....&lt;/edit&gt;

		Don't like this preset much. It has no music response.

		I disagree.  This looks very nice.  The front blob could use some work though.  I might try tweaking it in my spare time.<br />
<br />
<br />
It kinda looks like images from an electron microscope.

		not enough color variation imo but otherwise pretty cool looking.  it could also do with some more music response

		Definitely needs some more color and music responsitivity.<br />
The dark blob is a bit too big as well.

		uhh... thanks for the critique. quite helpful<br />
but the question was to help find a way to eliminate the black blob but keep the cool trail...<br />
I tried doing a constant shift upward and using wraparound to move the blob to the edges but it just looked ugly<br />
<br />
<br />
and I also thought i looked like something from an electron microscope<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; and if you want to make it smaller try enabling Blend Blitter on the blitter feedback (it also adds a little more detail to the trail)

		Ummm, may I submit the remix I did? Thanks... Well it is basically the same, but I added a DM and DDM which it now responds to the music. I can't explain how it looks but I took the same info from the remix that ishan did of my AVS. So yeah, basically it is somewhat the same but the DM and DDM was added to it though. Oh Akuso, please don't give me any credit. I don't mind the credit since some might not agree that it looks good as well.

		I made another remix though. I just wanted to wait for your reply before I posted the second remix that I made. Looks more like Mysterious Beat Beauty(Ishan remix). Which was my AVS that was modified. This time it looks a bit different and you will understand what I mean when you see the second remix that I made for it.
