      <p class="post-content">you sayd cube<b>s</b><br />
      fine...<br />
      <br />
      note that, just don't simply edit "Jaak - Simple cube 2" this is a ready preset, you may just use the cube code inside it and if you want to use other parts of this preset... you must ask premission to <u>remix</u> it.<br />
      <br />
      I hope you understand my coding, it should be clean enough. If you want a simple wirefame cube, then grap itfrom preset "cuuuube" (or whatever it was named).<br />
      Anyways, i hope this helps you somewhat.</p>

      <p class="post-content">now i'm sure he'll use your code in his own presets without crediting you. These sort of things will encourage rippers, please make them search the forums themselves.</p>
