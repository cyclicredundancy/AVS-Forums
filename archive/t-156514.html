		Just a simple idea:<br />
<br />
To provide beat detection to Hotlist, i am using an APE.<br />
<br />
Why don't fill it with something usefull?<br />
<br />
It's no trouble to add some sliders and buttons to the hotlist interface, so does anyone have a good idea what could be usefull?<br />
<br />
Basically i think about somethin like transitions, but a fast remote text display could also be cool. There could be multiple selectabe effects.<br />
<br />
Your ideas please. :)

		YES! <br />
<br />
If you have a look at doing something like milkdrop transitions which use random transitions that activate with some sort of beat detection setting. Some scenes change quite fast (1 sec changes) which is quite effective and some stretch out for longer... hmmm... perhaps a manual change setting with some unique transitions? <br />
<br />
I kind of like the transitions in R2E although you'd need open GL to power them.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL EFFECTS - YESS!

		I thought of something like additional filters or movements which you can control in shape and intesity directly through the hotlist interface.<br />
<br />
I'll probably end up writing a control-&gt;regXX ape. So you can set your reg values by using trackbars to control whatever you like. 10 values should be enough I think.<br />
<br />
Shouldnt be too hard to do this, but i guess this will be something for v2.4<br />
<br />
Technically, i'll have to do it the following way:<br />
<br />
-Ape sends message to Hotlist, submitting information about this value (to set by the user as a reminder e.g. &quot;x-axis rotation&quot;) and requesting a value<br />
-Hotlists displays the information and sends back the requested value.

	<blockquote>
			
				fast remote text display could also be cool</blockquote>
YES,this would kick ass. I realy like puting text on and the current way of doing it is cumbersome to say the least. <br />
<br />
which remindes me:<br />
this friday I had a gig in the biggest club in slovenia and I made a big pupu out of it:D. Didnt eat during the day because I was buisy and forgot. then during the projecting i drank cca.2dl of vodka and experienced a power failor in my head:D. all in all i played about 3 presets and put on the text 'i will fuck you all'. I then proceded with blacikng out and leaving the screen blank. When i came to eveyone was pissed off and i couldnt figure out why because i dont remember a damn thing. I got banned from the club and got laughed at on a local techno forum:D. <br />
I also heard that i was danceing with my keyboard (which is missing about ten buttons and the connector) and tried to throw my monitor on the dance flor. Luckaly i was stoped by someone. The leason here is dont drink on an empty stomach or even better dont drink when on a job(even if you get a lousy salory):).

		Fsk, you didn't attend the &quot;how do i promote myself&quot; course did you? :p<br />
<br />
For myself, i made up 3 rules:<br />
<br />
Rule #1: <br />
No Drugs when i'm in charge of something at a Party!<br />
<br />
Rule #2: <br />
Don't even think about bending rule #1 in any fucking way!!!<br />
<br />
Rule #3: <br />
If rule #1 and #2 and seem to fail, set yourself a limit so you're still able to act professionally.<br />
<br />
It worked fine until now. Yesterday i had a VJ Gig in Doubledee Club Dresden. There were pretty few peopel so i had time to do live testings with the new Hotlist, which revealed 5 previously unknown Bugs, luckily all minor ones.At about 1:30, the party was almost over, so i put on the video i recorded on FullMoon festival and started dancing myself for the remaining 2 hours together with the organizers and DJ's that were still there. Nevertheless, this was also the first time that i really got paid - 150€ including gas so after all there's still 100€ left for my A64 :D

		Nice job Magic, making a 100 off of one night, whenever I VJ I always seem to end up with less money then when I started, and I am usually getting paid too, hummmm, maybe it is just me.

		One tip, S-uper_T-oast, drink less expensive drinks ;). And you really should get of your betting-addiction.

		Nah, back on topic please ;)<br />
<br />
I've implemented some functions for LiveFX already, got the new APE SDK and i'll try to code the other part tonight. More soon.<br />
<br />
(can't help it *laughs at ST* :p)

		Coded a dummy app yesterday and it worked fine with the oneway request. Next two day's i'll make up the ape!<br />
<br />
Just a technical question, i'm providing 8 trackbar -&gt; regXX controls with a range from 0 to 256. Is the range ok or should i in/decrease or shift it?

		I dunno but dont the color cahnels have a range from 0-255, so i gues that would be better. Maybe you should scale it down to 0-1 like the other things are.

		I don't know. I could provide nearly every range you like. -512 &lt;-&gt; +512 for example.<br />
But taking these values you can convert a -128 &lt;-&gt; +127 range (signed byte) into one that reaches from 0 to 1 in 256 steps.<br />
<br />
Its just a question of the resolution. A larger range allows more fine tuning, you can still downscale it within your code.<br />
<br />
I could also make those setting customizable but this is sensless and would prevent any porting.<br />
<br />
So the correct question would be:<br />
-how many steps would you like to have (multiples of 2 or 10 do make sence here)<br />
-should the range be symetric or asymetric (symetric = -x &lt;-&gt; +x, asymetric 0 &lt;-&gt; +x)

		I dunno what the best solution would be but ill stick to my earlyer sugestion 256 steps in an asimetric range. <br />
Do you have any plans for midi control?

		Okay, so 0..255.<br />
No, have no midi plans, because i don't use midi, neither do i have any midi controler which i could use for testing and so on.

			<strong>bla</strong><br />
		
		

		I thik you should make it 0...1 or -1...1.<br />
Why?<br />
1. it's more &quot;standart&quot; for AVS, so easier to remember :p<br />
2. There is no accurate way to convert 255 to 1, except division, and division is much slower than multiplication. And -1...1 or 0...1 can be converted to anything.<br />
Steps? What about FP 8 digits? ;)
