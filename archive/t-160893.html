      This array support is REALLY wankass...I'm really disappointed that it was needed so badly that it had to be implemented so poorly. I hope we can get rid of this function before people start using it extensively, and implement proper array support later. It'd really be well worth the time and effort to implement some proper parsing.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, Zeven just had a good idea (not sure whether he was joking or not but it's still a nice idea): EvalLib2. Add an option in the Main tree to use EvalLib2, and if it's on, add a watermark to the preset. That way, we could throw away all the wank comparison functions and add in a host of new boolean/bitwise/logical operators. Also, you could add real if/elseif/else and for structures. Then, we wouldn't have to worry about compatibility with old presets, but still have decent code support.<br />
      <br />
      I know this would all be quite difficult to implement, but I think AVS is going down the wrong road ATM. The easiest way to do things isn't always the best :|</p>

      </blockquote>On the contrary, often the easiest way to do things can be the most efficient and most reliable. The current array setting, while a bit of a kludge to program for, is extremely powerful and useful. It's just lower level than you would have liked.<br />

      megabuf() and gmegabuf() are simply arrays, where you can store data... megabuf() is local to scope (dm, movement etc.) but <u>g</u>megabuf() is global...<br />

      To make an array of n elements where the first element is removed and the last element is added: you just keep a fixed array, and calculate your indices dynamically so that the first element is in fact always a different one (so you don't have to shift the array every time you add a point).

      <p class="post-content">uhh no that's not what i meant justin. what i meant was that this is not extendable, it's really tough to use - especially if you want to use more than 1 array - and it's EXTREMELY low level. my biggest problem is the variable limits. i honestly don't see what the big deal is with making extendable variable limits. i mean, why are the variable limits there in the first place? i'm not being accusative here, but i'd really like to know, since it doesn't make any sense. especially if you can extend it eightfold internally and not have a massive hit on performance.<br />
      the other problem i have is, when you add a function in avs it has very little possibility of ever improving. so that's why i don't like it when you add low level functions...they're not going to become high level functions in the future. along with the fact that since avs isn't parsing on the fly, a high level array management feature will have the same performance as megabuf() (I think). that's also why i suggested evallib2 - is there any chance that's gonna happen?</p>

      <p class="post-content">FYI, there are no longer variable limits (Since 2.8). It only took a small compile-time hit to add that, but it did require a lot of code reworking.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, once you get used to megabuf()/gmegabuf(), dividing it up into your own arrays is pretty easy.. and having megabuf() doesnt prevent us from adding array_alloc() etc later on -- this just provides a nice low level means to access a block of memory.<br />
      <br />
      Having said that, doing dynamic array allocation could have equal performance to megabuf() type functionality, but it really depends on how it would be implemented, and that we will determine someday heh...<br />

      <p class="post-content">agree with raz. And the order of stuff in the menu is still wrong sometimes:(.

      <p class="post-content">Firstly in responce to fragmers question: There is no "exec" function, only an 'exec2' and apparantly 'exec3' undocumented.<br />
      The syntasx is clearly documented in the expression help.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>st=exec2(assign(t,t+0.01),sin(t));</code>
</pre>would replace the standard:
      <pre>
<code>t=t+0.01; st=sin(t);</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      i assume exec3 just extends the syntax to exec3(a,b,c), where a and b are executed plainly, and c is returned.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I havnt had a "mystery" crash since 2.8 (i think).<br />
      <br />
      There is a problem with old installers reinstalling ape'S, and having them crash when you click. Ive never had a problem with this before, so i assumed it was something to do with the ape's uniqueidstring being doubled with the integrated version.<br />
      <br />
      The array functionality is quite interesting. Im sure ill get used to it. and by now i can feel i trust Justin to come up with the most logical solution for the time. After all, he is realistically only doing this for the sake of a very small community. The rest of the world doesnt give a shit about arrays or loops.
