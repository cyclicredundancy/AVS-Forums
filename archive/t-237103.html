		Just to warn you, this is noob grade work.<br />
<br />
Try doing something without Moving Particle, its easily one of the most used noob effects.

		<font size="3"><b>Beginner Works</b></font><br />
<br />
<font size="1"><b>Imaginary</b>: Looking good than the others (I think..). Anyway, try replacing the Render/Moving Particle by using Render/Texer II or Render/SSC.<br />
<br />
The others, nice but as jheriko had said it's a noob grade work.<br />
<br />
p.s.: Try using another interactive render..</font>

		This is my first pack and thus I'm a beginner. I had thought making a pack by just using Moving Particles then maybe when I learned how to code SuperScopes and the other coding effects, I would replace them. that's why I called this Particles, anyway I like moving particles and just because it's easy to use dosn't mean you shouldn't use it.<br />
<br />
thanks for your comments, I know you have seen hundreds of these noob presets before.

Thanks for appreciating that, I'm sure I come over as quite rude and discouraging most of the time :p

		Well the color &amp; effect work is fairly nice in my opinion, but yeah, the whole Moving Particles + Swirly Movements is as basic as it gets, basicly :p<br />
<br />
Also remember to give credit in <b>each of the presets that use others work</b>, not just in one preset.

		Actually, these are very good for newbieish work. You've pulled off some pretty good colourschemes with basic effects. I liked most of them, and I particularly loved the colourscheme on Watercolour/Smooth Particles. It's a 3.5ish pack I guess.<br />
<br />
Fireball is boring, and does not improve in any way on the original. You might like it, but I'd get rid of it. <br />
<br />
If you used someone's code in a preset, credit him in the same preset. Did you make the lowest DM in Astronomer's Dream yourself ? If not, and it looks so, you should've done that (sorry if I'm wrong).

That DM was originally made by UnConeD. Although I modified that a lot, I should have credited him, sorry for that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your review.
