      <p class="post-content"><strong>Some AVS plugin slowed down my system</strong><br />
      I have been using Winamp 2.78 for sometime now. I had installed a number of visualizations, some AVS, some not. I have been able to get decent performance out of them. AVS was very quick in the window mode and decent in full screen mode. Everything worked well, I had no complaints.<br />
      <br />
      Then I got greedy and installed 10-20 AVS plugins that looked interesting. Somewhere in that process my system slowed down. Not just Winamp, but all multimedia. It runs slow when I use Media Player, also. Now AVS, even run in a small window, runs slow and audio becomes choppy.<br />
      <br />
      This is key: the system was working well until I installed the AVS plugins and the entire system is slow when doing ANY multimedia, not just Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      I believe something got installed into my system that slowed the audio down and thus little horsepower is left for video. I'm wondering if an audio codec got replaced. I removed all AVS plugins and removed and reinstalled Winamp (now at 2.8), but its still slow.<br />
      <br />
      I looked at the CPU usage and found that it was quite high when running audio and maxed out when AVS was run. Memory usage is reasonable.<br />
      <br />
      Any help would be appreciated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Never mind. I think I solved the problem. I was noticing that on about 3-5 second intervals the video would pause. This occurred in media player also. I uninstalled vmware workstation and that problem went away. I hadn't played a video since I installed this program, so I hadn't noticed it an incorrectly assumed it was related. However it did affect AVS also.<br />
      <br />
      Then I changed the AVS settings to pixel doubling and everything sped up to nearly 30 fps. I think one of the presets I loaded changed my original settings.</p>
