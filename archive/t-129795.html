      <p class="post-content">The alpha blend is screwed up. You should fix it. But i don't know how, because im not a 3D artist :p<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise it's nice, pretty good beat reaction and nice colors. But you think foggy=dreamy ? :igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think the foggy does = dreamy, it looks dreamy but the texture should be smoother too, it ruins the effect. The DM is amazing, no problems there except for a few minor alpha blend bugs.<br />
      Great job :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice preset. But you can get a much nicer gradiated fade (IMHO) at the edges if you use a second DM for only that for abou 2FPS on my machine. I think it's worth it.<br />
      <br />
      That and I'd try and make the switch to the square tunnel a gradual shift, not a sudden one. I really dislike when presets do that.<br />
      <br />
      Increasing the grid size in the first DM is good too.<br />
      <br />
      Still, looks verra verra nice. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice<br />
      <br />
      Except I don't like that hue of green, it seems kind of ugly. I think it would better if it were a different color, take out the channel shift and you've got a nice blue color. That's just my opinion, it really doesn't matter. Do what you want :)<br />
      <br />
      Whoa! The DM just changed to a tunnel! Sweet! :up:</p>
