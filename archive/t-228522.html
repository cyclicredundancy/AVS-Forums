<div class="posttext">hey there :)<br />
<br />
i made a gravity engine for a preset a while back but was never happy with it, not to mention it having a colour bug in it when i releaced it &gt;_&lt;. so i made a better one that i like to think resembles something more like a sun being swallowed by a black hole thats a little, irratic :) <br />
seing as i don't have much time to avs stuff anymore i thought id just put this out there instead of it just wasting away on my hard drive :)<br />
<br />
not that im asking, but if anyone could do anything funky with it, id love it :) oh and there are 10000 particles or so in this so it might run a lil slow on slower computers.. and i left out dynamic texter resizing code because resizing 10000 images is not my idea of quick, so i wouldn't recomend anything more than 512x384 ;)<br />
<br />
oh, and whist i of course did all this windows, i changed the names to fit posting guidelines in linux and thus couldn't test it, i got a friend on a windows box to change the second texterII to the right bitmap name, but just incase the second texterII should point to 'gord - blackhole.bmp' :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice idea, looks quite funky<br />
<br />
Some points:<br />
<br />
- Use smaller texer2's where possible, blending is an expensive operation especially when you do it 10,000 times.<br />
<br />
- You have a load of pointless buffer saves and an effect list, you dont need them (see optimised preset)<br />
<br />
- You can do a lot of programmatic optimisation to speed it up, for example where you have:<br />
<br />
red=(1/255)*6;<br />
green=(1/255)*4;<br />
blue=(1/255)*2;<br />
<br />
Those are just constant values. At present you are doing 30,000 divides and 30,000 multiplications every frame to calculate the colour values, when you really need 0.<br />
<br />
I've attached an optimised version. As well as the above I also set the bounding box (outbox) to 1 (why would you want it any bigger?) and reduced the particle count. This gives me about 22fps instead of 14fps (57% faster :P )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yea i know about that stuff, it was just when i was making it kinda came out that way, lots of fine tuning when you have 10000 particles, too high a value and you have white _everywhere_, too low and black. n seing as its blended as regular 1 byte channels, makes sence. but yes i should of done that :) <br />
<br />
i think the biggest problem is the megabuffers, iv done tests before where you can get huge speedups.. hard to do without them though. <br />
<br />
all the rest of the weirdness in the code come from the fact that its based on an earlyer thing i did where the mouse was used to move the gravity well, which is a _lot_ of fun to play about with, seriously -_-<br />
<br />
<br />
the problem with using smaller bitmaps for texterII is that you end up having to use more particles to achive the same effect, catch 22 thing i guess. <br />
<br />
i'll see if i have time to take a look at the optimised one later and remove all the filler, so to speak :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can use a bit of a trick when using smaller texer's by setting the outbox to a value &lt; 1, tweak the speed settings and use a movement to resize it to the whole window (with bilinear filtering). I originally had that in the optimised version with a scale of 0.5 but i took it because it was a bit noticable, I think 0.75 or so would be hard to notice tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i had some spare time last night so i optimised it as much as i could whist keeping the same effect and fluidity. went with that resizing trick as there arn't really any sharp edges so it suits interpolated resizing nicely :) it runs at around 32fps on my 1.8ghz amd processor, around 200% speedup from the first version :).<br />
<br />
also _finally_ corrected some gravity code i did, before two objects with diffirent masses would fall at seperate speeds.. which.. isn't quite, right... really. now the only mass that counts is the gravity well :), makes me wish i still had my notes from college really.<br />
<br />
the gravity well movement isn't really what i want stil though, iv tryed to create some code many times that would produce the smooth effect that id like, but this will have to do.<br />
<br />
thank you mr pak-9 :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pretty damn nice. :up:<br />
<br />
I really like it when the 'thing' passes over the center and the 'stuff' explodes. ;)</div></div><hr />
