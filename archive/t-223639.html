		Hi and welcome to the never-ending world of AVS!<br />
<br />
My review:<br />
<br />
<b>Chaotic lines</b> - Please *do not* use invert like that. it hurts.<br />
<b>Danger Sence</b> - Pretty much the type of preset that everyone begins with.<br />
<b>does light excape</b> - You're right, this is indeed one of your better ones.<br />
<b>Dream in colour</b> - Neat colors<br />
<b>Evolution never dies</b> - Looks cool<br />
<b>Illuminum Squares</b> - Kinda boring and very repetative.<br />
<b>Party through coke</b> - Looks cool, I like this one best of your pack.<br />
<b>searching tunnels</b> - Tweaked too far IMO<br />
<b>security disco</b> - The colors are very static and the movement gets boring quickly too.<br />
<b>white noise</b> - I like it and dislike it at the same time.. It's a funny preset, but the hard colors and the high speed are a bit hard on the eyes.<br />
<br />
<b>overall</b><br />
Is all code written by yourself? if not - give credit to the original author(s)! 'Comment' can be found under [Misc]&gt;[Comment] <font size="1">(built-in effects don't need credit of course)</font><br />
Not bad at all for a first try.<br />
Also try reading some tutorials. Most of them can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">here</a>

		<b>Chaotic Lines</b>: Yes, I'll agree that this one has a serious flicker problem. That can be easily tamed, though. Try adding an empty Effect List to the end of the preset, set the input to &quot;50/50&quot; and the output to &quot;Replace&quot;. Poof, no more seizure-inducing flickers.<br />
<br />
<b>danger sence</b>: It would be better if it had more than just that yellow colour and occasional hint of red. Also, I actually like it more with the text enabled.<br />
<br />
<b>Does light escape</b>: I think it's the second-best of the set. The two dot grids combined with that convolution filter gives it a very unique texture.<br />
<br />
<b>Dream in colour</b>: Very colourful and very dreamy. I think it's the best of the set.<br />
<br />
<b>Evolution never dies</b>: Nice Superscope motion. The clock animation would've been a great touch if it was easier (although only slightly) to see. Try 128 0 128 instead of 64 0 128.<br />
<br />
<b>Illuminum squares</b>: That Convolution Filter and Texer don't seem to help much here; lose them. Also, you really need more colour here. You've already got the solution to that in the multiple Timescopes; try making the second one a 50/50 blend, change the number of bands in one of them, then make one &quot;left channel&quot; and the other one &quot;right channel&quot;. Suddenly, you've got some subtle but good colour variety!<br />
<br />
<b>party through coke</b>: Great texturing effect! Third-best of the set, I say.<br />
<br />
<b>searching tunnles</b>: I like the Superscopes (did you program those yourself?), but there's too much black, and the flashing and blitter effects are too distracting.<br />
<br />
<b>Security Disco</b>: It has its moments, but most of the time, it just doesn't quite work aesthetically... It looks like you're trying too hard to combine effects that worked well in the other presets. Try removing the Blitter Feedbacks (do you really need three of those?) to simplify it a bit.<br />
<br />
<b>White Noise</b>: Yup, that's what it is. Fun to watch for a few seconds, at least.
