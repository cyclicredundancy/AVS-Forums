      <p class="post-content">Nice preset. looks like water. It needs some extra movement to be cooler. i dont know what it needs but you could add some movement.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Cool preset. I like how every now again it kind of bubbles ******d. Since this is a beta, be sure you post up more resent versions as they come out. I am interested in seeing where this is going.<br />
      <br />
      I would suggest some kind of alpha blending around the corners to take care of those rough spots though.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>A Remix</strong><br />
      I did a remix of your file.<br />
      <br />
      I still dont know how to work with movements, so I couldnt really use an on-beat addition, however, I have fixed a couple of things, like the extra colors on the edges, and I have taken away the water effect, and added a movement and blur.<br />
      <br />
      Tell me if the remix looks better than the original. General feedback is also welcome.<br />
      <br />
      Thanx<br />
