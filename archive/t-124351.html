      <p class="post-content">Yes mathworld is a great site. Book-wise I have bought Andre LaMothe's Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus. This has a lot of interesting algorithms and physics stuff. Has anyone bought Eric Lengyel's Mathematics for 3D Game Programming &amp; Computer Graphics? I think I might get it. It looks like it has a lot of useful stuff.</p>

      <p class="post-content">0 I start AVS and create some Render Objects<br />
      1 I add some relieable DM's from some of my recent Presets<br />
      2 I duplicate them sveral times and change each of them a bit<br />
      3 Now the Preset looks cool but is awesome slow<br />
      4 I kill half of the DM's<br />
      5 Now the Preset runs quite fast but looks like shit<br />
      6 Frustrated, i close AVS and think about buying a new Processor<br />
      7 10 Minutes later i start from 0 again<br />

      <p class="post-content">I got my technical know how from myself mostly... i.e. i figured it out myself. This may seem a bit weird, but for example, when I first started to play around with qbasic I accidentally discovered polar co-ordinates, it just made sense to me that x=sin(r),y=cos(r) would define a circle, I was then taught of their existence at school about 4 years later. The only thing from AVS that I didn't really figure out myself was the 3D projection+rotation which I first found on a qbasic website several years ago. The other big help has always been the help files, the only programming/techincal book I have ever read is 'OpenGL Game Programming', I learned basic and c from help files and asm from the intel technical manual which can be downloaded from the intel website.<br />
      <br />
      When making a technical preset I usually sit down with a piece of paper for a while, figure out how it will all work, then code it up.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, since none of my presets could be considered "technical" (I attempted a few of those but they failed horribly... sigh), I generally just throw random crap together and tweak it until it looks good. I do use some of my limited math knowledge too... really, I do... :confused:</p>
