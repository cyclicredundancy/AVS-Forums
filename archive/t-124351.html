<div class="posttext">I base it on what I want to make, and the knowledge comes from experience, others, or one of those visits to mathworld.wolfram.com</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes mathworld is a great site.  Book-wise I have bought Andre LaMothe's Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus.  This has a lot of interesting algorithms and physics stuff.  Has anyone bought Eric Lengyel's  Mathematics for 3D Game Programming &amp; Computer Graphics?  I think I might get it.  It looks like it has a lot of useful stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I had to select all the answers becouse they are all true :)<br />
I agree mathworld is great...would be even better if it had all of the books free to view online :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Internet is great since it is free, but the best stuff is normally in books because the professionals would rather make more money than less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hello.<br />
 I usually depend on the stuff i learn at school and what i can find in the math books i have...Internet is a great source of information but a real person will always make you understand better then a book or html file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th February 2003, 21:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, but finding a real person to help you isn't that easy. I should have put that as an option. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I was talking about my math tutor or my math teacher lol.ANother good option for the poll could be &quot;winamp avs forum&quot;...I learned alot in a short period of time thanks to you guys !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th February 2003, 21:21</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's under internet.  But some people could get something from someone besides a teacher.  I know some friends who have helped me out a little, for example.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">0 I start AVS and create some Render Objects<br />
1 I add some relieable DM's from some of my recent Presets<br />
2 I duplicate them sveral times and change each of them a bit<br />
3 Now the Preset looks cool but is awesome slow<br />
4 I kill half of the DM's<br />
5 Now the Preset runs quite fast but looks like shit<br />
6 Frustrated, i close AVS and think about buying a new Processor<br />
7 10 Minutes later i start from 0 again<br />
<br />
Thats what Preset creating usually looks like...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmmm... Nice methods (I i thought that how the hell can U all make so neat crap)... <br />
Ok, mine is here: If I didnt knew anything about AVS then I slept in my classes, NOW is sleep AND think how to make some nice presets in my classes. Then I come home and realize that all i thought up was crap and I start using Tugs method...</div></div><hr />

I thought that was MY idea- if you read through the posts, I said &quot;bang the keyboard until it looks pretty&quot; a couple days before Tuggummi made his post</div></div><hr />

Michael, yeah, what ever... just to let you know i have used your idea for the past 3 years, do i have to pay you copyright royalties? :p<br />

oh, almost forgot, the more advanced method i use is the POTASWH method (Put One There And See What Happens)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I got my technical know how from myself mostly... i.e. i figured it out myself. This may seem a bit weird, but for example, when I first started to play around with qbasic I accidentally discovered polar co-ordinates, it just made sense to me that x=sin(r),y=cos(r) would define a circle, I was then taught of their existence at school about 4 years later. The only thing from AVS that I didn't really figure out myself was the 3D projection+rotation which I first found on a qbasic website several years ago. The other big help has always been the help files, the only programming/techincal book I have ever read is 'OpenGL Game Programming', I learned basic and c from help files and asm from the intel technical manual which can be downloaded from the intel website.<br />
<br />
When making a technical preset I usually sit down with a piece of paper for a while, figure out how it will all work, then code it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, since none of my presets could be considered &quot;technical&quot; (I attempted a few of those but they failed horribly... sigh), I generally just throw random crap together and tweak it until it looks good.  I do use some of my limited math knowledge too... really, I do... :confused:</div></div><hr />
