		Great movements, all presets look good to me.<br />
<br />
My faves are Waves 2(2), Mad Simply, Ondas vÃ£o e vem, <br />
<br />
Indeed, some are relatively simple, but at least they're fast.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see more of your work.

		thanks man, but that's not what I meant...<br />
<br />
I want it to go up and down, but with limits, you know?!<br />
<br />
it goes too deep, and stays there for too long, I want it to go down till a certain point and don't trespass it...

c=c+cos(sc+scx)*0.01;<br />
to<br />
c=c+cos(sc+scx)*0.002;

		Out of 5. That means that I'd have serious doubts whether to give it a 3.5 or 3 on the winamp scale if you submitted it. It would've been a 3.5 a year or so ago, but I decided to be a little more strict (and realistic).
