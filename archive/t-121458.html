<div class="posttext">It's not *really* the effect I was going for, but it's kind of neat...kinda.  Originally I was looking to make those shapes circular, instead of octogonal.  There's a small glitch that makes the occasional vortex appear - CFP's video delay, a corner-clearing superscope, and an onbeat clear fix this; but it causes the vis to 'blink' every four beats, as well as a major FPS drag.  Can anyone fix either of these small dilemmas, without me going into deep detail of how the effect is created in the first place?  I'm lazy :p<br />
<br />
btw, this has nothing to do with the MtG card from the unglued (funny how I wrote that UnGlueD first) series.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; (twice) fixed the attached preset, it now has another bugfix (it fixed the bugfix), and contains UnConeD's Texer APE and one of his bitmaps (borrowed!  just borrowed, I promise!), as well as CFP's Convolution filter and video delay APEs. &lt;/edit&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What does the video delay ape do?  Does your preset still need to be fixed? It looks fine to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The bugfix doesn't need to be fixed ;) But the effect and the slowdown do :/<br />
<br />
Video Delay saves an image to a seperate buffer, then re-renders it after a given number of beats or frames; I use this to delay the frame clearing for one and two frames, so my buffers get cleared entirely (otherwise I get ugly vortexes)</div></div><hr />
