			<strong>New AVS reviewers on Winamp.com</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi all,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to know your thoughts on this.<br />
<br />
Would anyone be here (preferably experienced preset authors) be interest in becoming a reviewer on winamp.com.<br />
<br />
Now I do not know if this will happen or not I am just 'testing the water'. <br />
<br />
If you did not know some of the skin authors also review skins on the WA site to help with share amount of reveiw material.<br />
But plug-ins are just done by WA staff.<br />
<br />
Would you people be interest in doing the same. The net effect would hopefully be speedier review times and keep standards higher.<br />
<br />
Some reviews I personally find for AVS to be.......a little of the mark sometimes. Sometimes a little out of date views. Cannot tell rips, etc. Which you people will easily.<br />
<br />
Also join in the discussion on the Plug-in forum at <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=86464" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=86464</a> about revamping the whole of the plug-ins sections on winamp.com<br />
<br />
Share your thoughts.....<br />
<br />

			<strong>Why not...</strong><br />
		
		

		I'd love to be a reviewer, but It kind of debends how many plugs/skins you'd have to rate in a day/week/month (1-4 sounds good to me), and do you need english in that (I'm not very good at it):hang:

		First off people I want to make clear that this was not an offer - I was testing the scenario out. I have no power to do anything like this but if there is enough support then hopefully something can be implemented.<br />
<br />
From what I understand about the skin reviews (and do not quote me!) is that they when they want take of the top of the pile of new skins to be reviewed. SO there are no deadline there to be meet, etc.<br />
<br />
I will ask on the skin forums though now........<br />
<br />
I would expect that those doing reviews for you to have a good command of English. This would not necessarily be a first language for you but be able to express yourself in a informative and detailed and descriptive manner. I imagine netspeak like WOOT 133t etc( sorry I do not understand netspeak (said proudly:)) would not be expectable on the main winamp. You would be a representative of Winamp after all!

		Hands up who remembers this thread.<br />
<br />
After giving up after banging my head against a brick wall. Well I have been on the case again recently and I beleive now these suggestions have been sent/pon there way to Nullsoft's relevant people.<br />
<br />
I know that it is underway for having a seperate AVS presets section (will the suggestion is underway) seperate like Skins, Plugins and AVS. This will help a lot of the sorting out of the site and the mass confusion of trying to find proper plug-in.:)<br />
<br />
I will keep you all posted about any develpoments with this. I will start bitching at the relevant people more.:)

		OK it has all been approved now! :)<br />
<br />
First off we need to I suppose get some standards about what we think that catagoeries etc stand for and then get some standardization of rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suggest to do this we pick a few packs or so (not a 5 star packs some poorer packs too to get a balance) and interested reveiwers do a trail reveiw of them.<br />
<br />
I know Nic01 when he does mini reveiws on the preset forum does this a little sometimes but you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
A few sentences/paragraph in summary of what they are like and give them a rating. If you say whty you gave it that rating for the different cat it will help I feel at this stage. SO we can discuss and decide what to do.<br />
<br />
I am of to bed now but if someone want set this bit up that will be great. Start a few new threads.<br />
<br />
I have no details as yet of how many packs a week are coming out so I cannot comment at this stage. But I would not have thought it would be too many. So if you reveiw a couple of packs a weeek that will be fine. <br />
<br />
LAter we wil decided on who are going to be members to be honest I think it will be better if established authors are involved but it is up to all of us here.<br />
<br />
Later

		OK more info.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
There are about 50 presets waiting to be published since the middle of July for WA2, and about 10 since the middle of August for WA3. When publishing the WA2 ones, publish them ONLY into the AVS category, other vis. for WA2 in windowed only. (is going to be renamed to visualizations, 3D and full screen will be deleted.) Will work on a separate AVS category for WA3 till they get them completely seperated from the components. <br />
<br />
Don't make the team too large, maybe start with 2, and when the need arises, add one at a time. <br />
<br />
Let me know asap the names to be given access to the data-base, and then we can set you up. <br />
<br />
wally<br />
------------------<br />
OK there is not that many packs to review I thought they would be many more than that.<br />
<br />
I suggest 3 of you to be reviewers (and I will chip in a bit too probably) as AVS reviewing IMHO will be a little more in depth than skin reviewing.<br />
<br />
So we all ready have the reviewed source material for setting a standard as it is what is ready to be published.<br />
<br />
Also there are no deadlines as such (no-one will tell you off it will be down to you how much you do) well be like logging and once this small backlog is cleared 1 or 2 packs a week or something. But remember you might get a crap pack to review.:)<br />
<br />
And from the sounds of things we can get to work right away on this as soon as we decide on members. And narrow it down to 3.<br />
<br />
I presume that is all the people who want to review are in this thread so if no-one joins in as it was an old thread (maybe some of the original people are not interested anymore) and no we know that little work is needed it is out of these three.<br />
<br />
I might just pick 3 but I would like others opinions as to who they would like, etc. So I would like all the people that post in these forums to comment if you do not mind.:) We are all friends here and mature enough to do that aren’t we…………aren’t we :)<br />
<br />
(edit: FOr me: I would like to see Nic01 be a reveiwer as he seem to give the most detailed preset pack advice/ratings on the boards when I drift through but he is not on the list. I am looking at what the rest of you on this list have posted like as I am not that fimiliar with all of your work/comments<br />
<br />
So the existing wannabbe reveiwers if you could confirm again and say who you would like to see as well both in this list and not in this list.:) So we get an idea)<br />

		As much as I'd like to review presets for the website... I don't want to. I'll stay reviewing in the forums - Less formal, and I have stage fright even through internet (Wow...)<br />
<br />
Oh well, hopefully a good reviewer(s) will be picked, and good luck to the person/people picked :D <br />

		Why have I just seen this thread now? If you're still looking for potential reviewers I'd be happy to offer my assistance. I'm not as experienced as some people here (only one pack but it's been well received), but my English is better than most and I resist using obscure net jargon. I think that helps.<br />
<br />
I'd especially like to lend support to seperating AVS from other visualisations. AVS is a world of it's own, as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
As for recommendations... I don't know. People tend to be a bit lazy when they post so it's hard to tell how well they can write when they have to.

		id be glad if someone reviewed my packs at all, i've been waiting for ages !!!<br />
<br />
ot(kinda): little question (aimed mainly at rovastar) what if someone makes an installer for both wa2 and 3 but submitted their pack as a wa2 plugin (i.e. me) would it be best to take the pack down and resubmit as winamp3 component or will it be chucked into both categories anyways?<br />
<br />
also i don't want to be a reviewer, its sounds like too much stuff to do.

		There are plans to seperate AVS from both WA2 and WA3 and making a seperate category where all presets will be placed, possibly in the form as a self installer for WA3.

			<strong>I just thought I'd put my two cents in</strong><br />
		
		

		i am pretty new to the community, but i have realized that most of the [regular] people are _very__ helpful, informative, and just generally nice.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed the quandry assosiated with assigning tasks to people that one does not know, and can only communicate with through ASCII. (:))<br />
<br />
So, i would suggest to the &quot;big cheese&quot; or whomever is running this show, that you take _special_ care in deciding whom you choose to review AVS presets.<br />
<br />
I love AVS, and it is a tool not to be taken lightly, i would ask that the reviewing process be only assigned to the best of the best. (out of the 15 regulars here :))<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

		To completely seperate the AVS presets from the plug-in and component sections will take a fair bit of backend work, so for now a seperate AVS category will be created for WA3 components.

Who would you call the regulars?<br />
<br />
Another thing, that large post gave me an idea, it would pretty cool to set up a poll of the candidates so that we can get a clear view of who everyone wants reviewing their presets.<br />
<br />
It's just an idea - I'm not really sure if its a good one or not.

		I don't/didn't mind suggestion like that and that is what I was trying to do with my previous posts but there is not much interest. The problem with the polls are that they are open to abuse and I think there would be only 5 votes cast or something with the 4-5 candidates that want to review.<br />
<br />
Anyway reviewing AVS packs is a learning curve to all of us. I imagine at the start of when the forum members started reviews the skins things were difficult but not they are all experts.:)<br />
<br />
I have left this post open but I think we need to get on with this as that backlog in not going down.:)<br />
<br />
So I have picked three:<br />
<br />
Jaheckelsafar,<br />
Doggy Dog,<br />
and......Montana (I hope the power does not go to your head.:);))<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your interest in this also we may need more in the future so keep posting you coments in the preset forums. In the initial stages I will be looking for all of you for feedback, etc as we will all be finding our feet.<br />
<br />
I will sort of access rights for you lot to have access to the reveiwers forums that you cannot see at the moment and PM me if you really want a custom title. :) *sigh*

		Just to make everyting clear, the log-in and password needed are the same as the one you use to submit your AVS presets.  We can't do nothing with your forum login. (well, we could, but we won't ;)  )

		I hope this post isn't dead and buried yet.<br />
Well anyway.<br />
My only concern about this review thing is that will it be a objective review? I mean if your an avs artist and you review others work you might give them a bad review or a good review depending on the artist no matter about the work...<br />
Example I consider Montana as a friend since we chat almost daily at irc and are both active in the avs community at deviantart.com<br />
So im asking will he be giving me 4,5 start just BECAUSE? Or would he downrate my work if he personally doesn't like it or knowing basicly my whole avs history would he be disapointed when compared to the older works?<br />
I guess im a bit sceptic about this whole thing, but im just asking...<br />
<br />
No offense Montana this has nothing to do with you... actually it is about you, but that's not the point meaning that this post could be directed for example nic01 or degnic ( being a fellow ff member i would sure &quot;blow the horn&quot; twice as loud ;) ), but they didn't make it as reviewer.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply...

		How do you tell with anybody? I assume we were picked because Rovastar read some reviews we have done, and didn't just go through the thread picking names at random. (uhh, you did read some of or reviews, right Rovastar)

		I read a few reviews not that many really to be honest with you - you lot had the most interest and that sway the decision also. <br />
<br />
Anyway as I said it is a learning curve I am worried about being too hard we have a chance now with the new WA3 site to set new standards.<br />
<br />
Initially there will be a lot of discussion about what is 3 stars, etc, etc. And we will try and get an average. After a few weeks/months we will know a lot better what standards we have and it is be harder to deviate from them levels.<br />
<br />
If someone obviously has realised a 2 star pack and a review person who is a friend gives it 4.5 stars then they jeopardize the credibility/existence as a reviewer so I cannot imagine too many doing that.<br />
<br />
Obviously people will not be allowed to review their own packs, etc.

		Don't shamelessly plug your packs like that, it makes you look desperate. :down:<br />
<br />
Instead, be nasty and plug them unconsciously everywhere you. Put subliminal messages into your Avatar, write your posts so that they read &quot;DOWNLOAD MY PACKS&quot; when written backwards and enslave those that do download them into a trance of mindless wondering.:cool: :D

my avs packs deserve huge amounts of viewing and respect thats why i plug them so shamelessly, they are really good and no one will believe me. (not quite yet up to unconed standard but give me a copule more packs and i'll be there). besides those three packs have been up there for almost two months now. just waiting to be reviewed, it annoys me thats all.

		We are still geting the access to the review section on the website sorted out and then we will probably spend  few more days getting some standard ratings sorted out. So give it a week.<br />

In fact I decided to make your 5 pack a test case for backstage.<br />

So I don't want to here another word about it. ok. :);):p<br />

now that is a good joke... (or a good excuse for those spelling mistakes:P)<br />
<br />
and thank you, i won't mention it any more. my pack 5 is really varied in quality (i.e. some of it is cack, some of it is really cool) so i'd be interested to see what you give it.<br />
<br />
(its not been uploaded to winamp.com yet just my 12&amp;3 since it wont let me put anymore up yet. i guess i make them too quickly.)<br />

dudes!!<br />
<br />
if you say that the new AVS reviewers arent allowed to use leet speak, its kinda frustrating when the current ones do :mad: <br />
<br />
quote{<br />
<br />
Decent presets... somewhat basic tho There are a few really nice ones here; particularly the ones that utilize el-vis superscopes. The author's own 'Primary' is very nice; overall a solid pack for a first release. Some additional tweaking and experimentation would be nice tho.<br />
<br />
}<br />
<br />
&quot;tho&quot;?!!??!?!?<br />

<br />
ok, this post sounds a lot more pissed off than i meant it to be<br />
<br />
total props to the AVS reviewers (then and now) for the damn good job they do<br />
<br />
but you must decied wheather or not to use leet speak (if i were j00 (:)) i would opt not too)<br />

		I'd think you'd use correct English as much as possible.. i.e. proof-read what you write and run it through a spell checker.<br />
<br />
Oh and I'm a firm opponent of 'r' 'u' 'gonna' 'ain't' 'cuz' '2' etc. and I consider them 'l33t speak'. They make it harder to read, are non-standard and have no advantages... ironically, they're being used mostly by inexperienced computer users because the speed-up gain from typing 'u' instead of 'you' makes sense for them. And it's hell for foreigners who've learnt English through the 'net and don't know those abbreviations are not standard English.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the point in the Slashdot article though. Of course the teachers should fail the students who use internet language instead of correct English. Since when did spelling and grammar lose their importance???<br />
Languages do evolve, but there's no reason why specific slang (Internet/SMS speak) should be accepted as uniform English. Without a fixed set of rules, a language dissociates into dialects which eventually end up as different languages. For example, Latin dissociated into Spanish, Portugese, French and Romanian.<br />
What's also important is that a language should remain fairly constant in time, otherwise it becomes hard to read older documents. For example middle English is pretty similar to modern English, but old English becomes very hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think native English speakers who still make common mistakes like confusing homonyms (your/you're, they're/their) are a bit pathetic. What the hell is school for??? I can spell my own native language near perfectly, and Dutch has got some very tricky bits.<br />
<br />
Word XP's AutoCorrect feature is especially evil, because it corrects errors very discretely. That way people will think they're not making mistakes and won't learn.

		this thread has strayed so far off topic.<br />
<br />
okay, i've always considered leet speak (or hacker speak as it was introduced to me as 4/5 years ago) to be the use of numbers and symbols to create an alternative to using letters. i can see the logic behind considering stuff like r, u, 2 and tho leet speak since they are written slang which has developed mainly through the internet. i personally tend not to use these things too much but i have to admit that they do slip themselves in every now and again.<br />
<br />
i apologise for not bothering to capitalise anything, thats partly due to my dodgy keyboard which makes the left shift hard to press (i'm not really used to using the right one).<br />
<br />
by the way, unconed, a homonym is a word which shares its spelling with another but has a different meaning, two words which sound the same are called homophones.

		Hmmm actually I thought of writing homophone (which is what I call it in Dutch), but I remember reading somewhere that in English, the correct term is &quot;homonym&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's logical though if you look at the etymology (greek):<br />
- 'omoios = same<br />
- nomos = name<br />
- phonos = sound

Well anyway.<br />
My only concern about this review thing is that will it be a objective review? I mean if your an avs artist and you review others work you might give them a bad review or a good review depending on the artist no matter about the work...<br />
Example I consider Montana as a friend since we chat almost daily at irc and are both active in the avs community at deviantart.com<br />
So im asking will he be giving me 4,5 start just BECAUSE? Or would he downrate my work if he personally doesn't like it or knowing basicly my whole avs history would he be disapointed when compared to the older works?<br />
I guess im a bit sceptic about this whole thing, but im just asking...<br />
<br />
No offense Montana this has nothing to do with you... actually it is about you, but that's not the point meaning that this post could be directed for example nic01 or degnic ( being a fellow ff member i would sure &quot;blow the horn&quot; twice as loud ;) ), but they didn't make it as reviewer.<br />
<br />
Waiting for your reply... </b></blockquote>
You're first post Tugg, I'm so proud of you. :p

		I remember this thread, what i didn't remember though that it was my first post. Actually im pretty sure there's somekind of a mix-up here, because i remember my first post being something of a tech-support kind :weird:<br />
<br />
Maybe the database got fux0red or something?

		I remember this thread<br />
<br />
It shows how terrible the AVS submissions system used to be. Note that the time taken for my AVS packs to originally be reviewed is the same reason they dissappeared off of the servers years later and I had to reupload them...<br />
<br />
Yup, years later and I am still complaining.

		Imagine that... out of those three eager lads full of energy who were given the honour (and one replacement), I'm the only one left, and, due to the number of packs, we don't need more...

		You know, there are at least 30 people that I'd rather recommend for the position than you, and those are just the ones I can think of this second.<br />
<br />
You're 4 years and a month late to apply for the position. Read the thread before you post. And even if we needed a new reviewer, and even if we thought you knowledgeable enough to do that, you'd still be rejected because of your spelling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please tell me you were kidding...<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone please lock this thread.
