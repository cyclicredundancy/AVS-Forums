      Im not sure this isn't mentioned somewhere but Im sure it would kick ass if you could control variables with buttons sliders and such. And Im sure one of you APE writers could do this. I dont own a midi controler but if this worked Id buy it:). VJing visuals coded so that you can control stuff in them would be much more fun and :cool:.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hi I'm also a vj and using winamp avs since 2000 for vjing.<br />
      (By the way if you are german we have a vj forum at <a href="http://www.eye-con.tv" target="_blank">www.eye-con.tv</a>)<br />
      I was always dreaming of a midi contoler for my variables. It would realy kick as.<br />
      But as soon as the new avs version is released it will be possible for plugins to controll the variables(as much as i understand).<br />
      I just downloaded the pre3.<br />
      I'll take a look at it and try my best.<br />

      <p class="post-content">/me agrees with killahbite<br />
      I could never use AVS for large scale VJing, but it would be nice if you could use an ape to change a variable using sliders and such, maybe it could be done using global vars?</p>

      I dont use any other stuff because it doesnt let you code stuff and mixing video clips is just not my thing (and besides I dont have the eqipment). I dont realy do any large scale VJing :), just small clubs. I recently desided that im gonna quit doing it until I think of something that will make it more interesting (for me). And midi variables would make it more interesting and they would make it compleatly different than mixing clips. VJing with avs isnt the best thing, but a lousy VJ playing 10000 clips a second is much worse IMHO:P.<br />
      <br />
      Im kinda sure it could be done, the new SDK (whatever that is) alowes APEs to change Globals. But the thing is I cant make this myself because I dunno any C++ or any other serious language. I think Im gonna have to learn some soon because this is becomeing a huge handycap. Any sugestions for books or similar stuff?</p>

      <p class="post-content">as a first step, you can check the midi protocol specs :<a href="http://www.srm.com/qtma/davidsmidispec.html" target="_blank">here</a><br />
      <br />
      &amp; then work hard to give us the bl****y plugin!<br />
      <br />
      (sorry i couldn't find more literature)<br />
      <br />
      + there's the winstick plugin and a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=96356" target="_blank">proto midi plugin</a> that works only with midi channel 1 :cry: :cry:</p>

      There's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmusic/" target="_blank">PortMidi for the MIDI support</a>, then you'd only need a gui for the mappings...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>suggestion</strong><br />
      maybe on the varibles thing how about a controled environment where you can actualy inlay avs commands but in a more controled form.<br />
      <br />
      like for example #reg00=sin(#reg00)<br />
      but it has a slot for each reg and can be switched around like the debug window does when you want to view other regs. heh possiblility look out.</p>
