      <p class="post-content"><strong>Building APE's with Borland C++ Builder</strong><br />
      Hi to all APEr's,<br />
      <br />
      I have several ideas for writing APE's. But I dont have MS Visual C++.<br />
      <br />
      So I tried to convert the tutbox example (from NSDN/WVS) to Borland C++ Builder 6.0. I've done it so far that I can compile without error's (using Tools-&gt;Visual C++ Conversion Utility), renamed to .ape and sent to avs\plugins\. But it will not be shown in AVS :down: (But also AVS doesn't crash :up: ).<br />
      <br />
      Has anyone got it working already? Can anyone send me c++ builder example-ape with source code? It would also be helpful to send me a miniminimini.ape in MS VC++ source code for conversion trial (without resource, config-screen-stuff, etc.)?<br />
      <br />
      I hope you can help me, because I WANT to make it run.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you everybody,<br />
      Andreas<br />
      <br />
      PS: you can find the converted tutbox project attached</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry, no Borland here. Make sure you export the AVS_APE_Retr (or something like that) function.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm,<br />
      <br />
      I looked into the export definition and found extern "C" __declspec (dllexport) int _AVS_APE_RetrFunc(...). That makes me wondering, because you (thanks UnConeD) mentioned AVS_APE_RetrFunc(). Removing preceding "_" fixes the loading problem, so that I can see the plugin under +-&gt;Tutorials-&gt;Box v1.0 now.<br />
      <br />
      But when I select it, it crashes Winamp with "Runtime Error" (Visual C++ runtime library). It seems to be harder than I thought.<br />
      <br />
      When debugging the .ape, everything works fine until the render() function is called. The "c_thisclass-&gt;enabled" flag (Set to "1" in constructor) is always a different _random_ number when I try to activate the plugin. So that it seems to be a problem with the c_thisclass instance (probably casted as c_rbase, and so the class property doeas not exists?). Many open questions here...<br />
      <br />
      I hope, a c++builder guru can assist me in porting this to Borland.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you<br />
      Andreas<br />

      Which would suck heavily.

      <p class="post-content">No,<br />
      <br />
      I don't think, visual c++ is needed. Shouldn't simple class definitions be equally represented by bcb and vc?<br />
      <br />
      Uh, when i think about it, c++ compilers differ in many way's. And when it comes to _MS_ compilers...<br />
      <br />
      I have a idea to solve this problem: If someone can write a "wrapper-ape" thet can load a .dll dynamically ? Like avi-render or image-render do this with media. In the loaded .dll (the one I will write) only three simple stdcall functions would need to be exported:<br />
      - int init();<br />
      - int render(char visdata[2][2][576], int isBeat, int *framebuffer, int *fbout, int w, int h);<br />
      - int destroy();<br />
      <br />
      Thats all. And it can be heavily ported to other Languages (thinking of Borland C++ Builder and Delphi too) because it doesnt use this C++ Classes Stuff.<br />
      <br />
      It would be REALLY great if someone can think about it, because not everyone can buy Visual Studio, but has access to simpler compilers, which can build .dll's too.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for your effort on that (hopefully),<br />
