      <p class="post-content"><strong>Max symbols in text render?</strong><br />
      I need a HUGE amount of letters for this preset, and I have a pretty good idea that winamp doesn't like me trying to get them all in. Every time I try to paste them in, it crashes the AVS editor. I'd say it's around 861 is the minimum I'd need. Is it possible to increase the number I can put, or a way to use multiple text objects to make it so it doesn't freeze?<br />
      <br />
      Edit: Or is there a different plugin that has a letter generator built in?<br />
      <br />
      What I'm trying to make is a peice for a music video, and what I'm lloking for is that "Decoding letters" look, where it's got a bunch of random letters flashing through it, until it reaches the right ones and keeps them. I'm matching the flashes to the beats, and the song has 124 beats that the AVS catches. I'm working with one word in each text object, and it's: 6 letters, 8 letters, 13 letters, for the three words. the 861 is the number of symbols I need, including colons for blinkage</p>
