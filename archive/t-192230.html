			<strong>Ok This is An Update to another post of mine</strong><br />
		
		

		Ok last year or the beginning of this year i made a request for some one to make me the style of avs i had made in another programs visual display.<br />
<br />
from what i described nobody knew what i was talking about.. ( not unusual )<br />
<br />
but somebody did have an idea of what it would more then likely be called or what it would be in the style of.<br />
and suggested a plug in which i got.<br />
it was the nullsoft visualization libriary plug in by justin frankel??<br />
<br />
and with all the things going on with my computers and other stuff i just got this plug-in working.<br />
<br />
it has the style and the type only not completely.  this plug in is the one for the original versions of winamp visuals and is able to be docked in the small window inside the player.<br />
<br />
it has the two red and blue line scope and others.<br />
<br />
i have just found what is the closest to what i want and what i did. <br />
<br />
it is a &quot;Solid Scope&quot; and &quot;line analyzer&quot; only what i did to it is so weird it is hard to understand. but here is again what i did to it, i will use the one playing in winamp now to describe what i did.<br />
<br />
1. this one has the base or loudest part of the song on the left side of the screen.<br />
2. it is only one line.<br />
3.it is only one color.<br />
<br />
what i did was this.<br />
<br />
a. used a program that had the loudest part on the right side of the screen ( plug-in window)<br />
b. made the one solid scope line in to a 2 solid scope line.<br />
c. made the single color per solid scope line in to 7 colors.<br />
d. made the colors appear by being controlled by  the volume and the freq.<br />
e. made the 7 colors really only 4 colors  one color was black and used 3 times.<br />
f. what it looked like was then easy to under stand the colors were <br />
    a1. black<br />
    a2. olive green<br />
    a3. pale yellow peach<br />
    a4. red<br />
 the result of these colors being placed in the proper show order was to have no line shown when the song was not playing.<br />
and the olive green was used for lower freq.'s and volume like when some one  was talking in the song with out music. or just a strum of the guitar. the pale yellow peach was used for when they were louder like  having music and or was singing loud or in a normal loud voice. the red was used as in the absolute loudest  volume and freq.'s possible so you would only get that to show on very loud songs.<br />
<br />
knowing the above a song that would start out low like  &quot;we are the champions&quot; would not show red until the very last minute or so.  it would start out black move to green with some pale yellow peach on top of the   green and then the red would be on top of the pale yellow  peach. and like the line analyzer does with the spikes going up and down so would the colors. when the lines filled the plug-in screen to one color that was the loudest and would be all red.<br />
how ever to make it  really strange you can see the line analyzer is not filling the whole plug in screen at the same time.  neither did my red color.<br />
<br />
but to make it even more weird the black was used at the start of the song like i  said to make the line disappear when nothing was  playing.  it was also used as the color between the olive green and the pale yellow peach and the red.<br />
what this did was make it appear to be bursts of colors being shot out of the right hand side.  with the base or long held out  notes were being stretched across the plug-in screen.  this is what was like ufo's.<br />
<br />
however this is the tricky part to under stand.<br />
when looking at the solid line scope with line analyzer on it you see the up and down on both sides of the line.  <br />
<br />
i was able in the other program to rotate the top end towords the front of the screen and the bottom end towards the rear of the screen so you would only get the top end showing on the line.<br />
<br />
i then reversed the rotation on the other channels line so it would show the bottom end towards the front and the top to the rear so you would get to see only the bottom end on that channel.<br />
<br />
that effect made it have different bursts of colors on different beats so that both lines would not be in sync.<br />
like the stagered fire of side by side cannons are not in sync.<br />
<br />
<br />
i could do that in the other programs visuals until they changed the way they made the visuals, but not in winamp.  so can some one else do the above?

		Its really hard to understand what you mean because your English is so stunted... From what I can gather the AVS your describing isnt very complex, I recommend you just learn the basics of AVS and make it yourself.

		Firsty, it is a very simple effect. If you put your mind to it, im sure you could work it out yourself in no time. <br />
<br />
Second, if you already have a vis that you want it to look like, why not just look at the original vis ;)

		okay this is the first message i found when searching for my old requests for this plugin.<br />
<br />
thanks for your ideas guys.<br />
<br />
but i just now found out how to get one close to what i wanted.  so it will have to do.<br />
<br />
if you want to see what i was trying to discribe ? well almost what i was saying as winamp cant make them the way i did in the other program.  but i got one simular to the one i wanted.<br />
<br />
i posted it in my winamp vis zip file with all the other ones i did in 2002  which are not very much liked as you all called them newbie vis's.  but that is what i like, <br />
<br />
the newones in the zip file are one that i changed from joshua  i think it was his 3d thing wav? vis  i just modified it for my liking and called it &quot;drum fire&quot;  the one i got close to what i posted for in this first post is called &quot; line explosions &quot;   if you get it and look at it just ask me to tell you what is different then i can tell you as you will have a good idea of what i wanted then.<br />
<br />
enjoy.<br />

		ok i will tell you anyway just to make sure you that got it can understand what i wanted. even though nobody asked, i'm just that way.:) <br />
<br />
the differance between the other way in the first post and winamps way is<br />
that in winamps way the color red is on the right channel<br />
the color green is on the left channel, <br />
and there is only one line across the screen which is on the left side and mirrored on the right side, making it look like a left and right plasma gun shooting towards the center of the screen.<br />
<br />
the other way in message one.<br />
<br />
had two lines like in a wav editor one left and one right.<br />
<br />
both were green when sound was at low volume the louder the volume got then a yellow green color would apear in the middle of the green blobs of color,  and the sound was really loud then red would apear in the middle of the yellow green color each color would over power the one it punched through. <br />
and the lines were on the right side of the screen shooting the plasma guns towards the left side of the screen,  the color blobs would be larger and longer depending on how loud and how long the note was played. <br />
<br />
that is how it was in the other program  but the line explosions avs in winamp here is close to what i wanted. <br />
so it is fine with me.:D

		thanks warrior of the light. :) <br />
<br />
two days i thought was long enough for people to have seen and posted a reply.  since nobody did i just answered anyway,<br />
<br />
why?  because there were two other replys to the orginal message that i never got any emails about.?  so pepole did see it and reply later which i did not know they had done so.<br />
<br />
but i see in being polite and posting the answer in case some one else in the future searches the fourms and finds the message then wonder'ed what i wanted at first.  could see what i wanted by my third post.   <br />
<br />
is not very well liked being done in this forum? <br />
atleast by those that are too young to be polite.<br />
<br />
<br />
and those same young know it alls if it was that simple to make my orginal plugin request? then why did you not make it for me?  oh thats right your not polite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:cool:
