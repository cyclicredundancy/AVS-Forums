<div class="posttext">You might consider putting a hyperlink to the post or the site where they can download Whacko AVS Pack IV (I hope I got it right, UnConeD :D).  I believe it's embedded in that pack.<br />
<br />
It would just make it a little easier for people like me who different computers and may not have everything installed on both of them (or if you're like me, would rather click on a hyperlink than to search for the thing to download ourselves :) ).<br />
<br />
I'll check your pack out on my other computer soon, though :) (it has metaballs already installed)<br />
