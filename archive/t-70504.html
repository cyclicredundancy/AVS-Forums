<div class="posttext">Dude.... I remember there was this one AVS preset in one of the original packs that came along with Winamp called Dance floor or something like that. It was supposed to look like a sad dance floor at the end of a part or something with a spinning circle and moving light. Does anyone know where I can get it?? I really liked it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's also not the only dance floor AVS there is out there.  Winamp Disco (UnConeD), Transvissa Mies (Tuggummi), and a host of others...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">True, but this is the only one that came with Winamp (unless you count mig's Crashdancer) and is the &quot;sad dance floor&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And the ones that come with winamp suck big fat testicles.  Everyone knows this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I concur, I think Nullsoft should bundle it wif some 'Elite Forum Regular' packs (Whacko, J, Forward Flow, etc.) or perhaps the 10 highest rated packs, give the people who don't know shit about avs some selection. I mean, it's only so long you can stand render/rings and render/stars before you are driven off AVS completely. Also I think AVS Primer should be included as well, so we don't get so many n00bs in here :mad: <br />
<br />
Actually, it might be a better idea to include presets from all levels of quality, to show people what they can achieve now, and what they could achieve if they try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You canot claim that all presets bundled with Winamp are bad.  There were a number of good presets by el-vis, duo, and mig included.  I think that you are going a little to far in saying that they all are bad.  But, I do agree with the fact that the presets included should come from the elite.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They could at least sort the ones that come with it into folders, like the first version of AVS (justin, lone, newpicks, etc.) rather than just have the avs folder full of assorted avs files (elvis_, lone_, duo_, justin_, etc.).</div></div><hr />
