<div class="posttext">I have been tweaking on this one for an hour or so, and it's almost there, but not quite. I kind of want like the basic &quot;flowing gelatinous goo&quot; look. I believe it's in the color mod or convo filter. But you guys would know better. I am open to any suggestions:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">if you have problems concerning your presets you should post that in the AVS Troubleshooting (http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=139) section.<br />
<br />
OK, i'll have a look right in a minute..<br />
<br />
/edit: what should that 'flowing gelatineous hoo'-style exactly look like? Shall it be viscous/glutinous in some way (= slow kind of flow)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I didn't really consider it a 'problem' per se, I was just looking for some variations on ways I could do it.<br />
<br />
But I see what you mean. I will be more careful where I post in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh, ok.. well i just saw that you didn't get it the way you wanted it to, but however... :p<br />
<br />
but i'm still wondering what that 'flowing gelatineous goo'-style is...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I suppose a good example would be 'Brainstorm' by Duo. I mean, mine will never look like that, but maybe you see what I mean. Another example would be Sandy Kupers' 'Upward Current'. (Mine will definetly never be that good). I just want that same kind of flowing mass look but with my scope dictating the flow's movement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ah! that's what you were looking for... yeah those are really nice flowing-presets! im sure, if you stick with those examples and try to achieve that look you'll surely get it but also understand more bout the effects in avs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok. Thanks, I will get it eventually. I think it's close, even though it doesn't look like it...<br />
<br />
btw, that list of needed ape info will be on the other thread by tonight. (wont be much; author names mostly) ;)</div></div><hr />
