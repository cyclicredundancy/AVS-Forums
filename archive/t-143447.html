<div class="posttext">With the new MD beta we have, we can make custom waves. I decided to go back and convert my &quot;Why does avs keep changing&quot; preset over to milkdrop, or atleast the scope. I'm having some trouble and I though you guys might know.<br />
<br />
Since MD dosen't use D &amp; R I have to convert them, but I don't know how.<br />

I posted it in the MD forums if anyone wants to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cartesian to polar conversions:<br />
<br />
d=sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y));<br />
r=atan2(x,y);<br />
<br />
x=cos(r)*d;<br />
y=sin(r)*d;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">not quite m2k, but close.  the actual conversion (in a *perfectly* square window) is:<br />
d=sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y))/sqrt(2);<br />
r=atan2(x,-y);<br />
x=sin(r)*d;<br />
y=-cos(r)*d;<br />
<br />
i KNOW that's not the way it's supposed to work, but since when did anything else in avs work correctly anyhow...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Now that Milkdrop has custom waves, are there any plans for taking Milkdrop preset customization to the same level as AVS?<br />
<br />
I have to admit I haven't tried the latest version (geisswerks only has 1.03), but I assume Milkdrop is still stuck in the same Movement + Drawing + Color Adjustments loop, rather than providing freeform stacking...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh Atero, I have this lovely image for you:<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well at this stage MilkDrop still has similiar setup as before. It is not at the level of customization of AVS but with 3d ssc's and other things there is more posibilities and it is more like AVS. :)<br />
<br />
Anyways here si the latest beta for all those interested. Didn't want to spam but there appears to be some interest ANd maybe oneday we will see the equivalant AVS features in a 3d enviornment like MilkDrop. At least one of Nullsofts visualizations is still being worked on.<br />
<br />
v1.04beta4b - http://www.geisswerks.com/t/milkdrop_fractal_pancake_surprise.zip<br />
<br />
There are examples of ssc's etc from the forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yay, milkdrop is becoming more like AVS. Or you could just use AVS.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">*sigh* not going to enter some flaming battle. WE all know the problems/limitations with the various visualizations that Nullsoft make.<br />
<br />
It has been discusssed many time before about the lack of 3d H/w support of AVS and how the best thing for it would be to start from the ground up to make a new version which uses these features.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the engine for MIlkDrop has been updated to DX8 too so it is a load faster too.<br />
<br />
Anyway as a lover of all visualiations I am just glad Nullsoft are at least updating one of there vvises.</div></div><hr />

Ryan Geiss is being laid off.  AOL seems to be royally fucking up winamp in every way that they can.  It seems as though nobody cares about any of the visualizations any more.:mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey, i have an idea<br />
<br />
lets make OMFGWEHATEAOLTHOSEBASTARDSAmp!  and we could have WTFAVSSOMUCHOWNEDMILKDROPWHENWINAMPWASCOOL...VS!<br />
<br />
...or something like that...<br />
<br />
i'm half serious, it's time we gave aol the finger and moved on to better things.  i'm convinced winamp5 is going to be only slightly less of the pos that 3 was, and we've got several more than capable cpp programmers (/me looks at jheriko, pak-9, unconed, etc.), and a knowledge of what *we* want in the vis/player...<br />
<br />
or maybe i'm just babbling and dragging this thread off topic.</div></div><hr />
