			<strong>picture slide show ?!</strong><br />
		
		

		Hello! <br />
I'm new to this forum and to this avs stuff. <br />
I was wondering how a picture slide show can be made.. .it would be cool to do such a thing and change the pictures on beat.<br />
I want to make an &quot;on beat slide show&quot; for a dj and winamp has the potential. <br />
I suppose it's a stupid question and can be made easy:) Can anyone help? <br />
Thanks!

		Purely theoretically it can be done, but realisticly.. no. You can't.<br />
<br />
Technical details:<br />
AVS wasn't designed to work with images. AVS does support them, sure, it supports video's aswell, but all on a very limited basis.<br />
In AVS, an image loading component can only load one image, not an entire directory.<br />
This means that if you have 14 images, you'd have to instruct <i>each</i> image to show up when all the other 13 don't. <br />
Then, if you'd want to add a new (15th) image, you'd have to modify all the other images too not to show up when the other <i>14</i> images are shown... etc
