      Well Here is my first APE<br />
      (I did it just to get an APE going)<br />
      <br />
      it includes a line drawing algorithm (no Device Context to be seen here)<br />
      <br />
      This contains 16000 points<br />
      <br />
      3D landscapes are next!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow that looks.....very complex, but there are no configurations to it. It might be useful if you could change the colors, select the number of lines, etc. Still, not bad.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Eh, that's alright, but it could be done with a SSC plenty well enough. It's pretty slow too - I don't think 16000 points is necessary. That's a quarter of the number of points in the 320x200 window that most people use. No need to do nearly that much.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Its much better to model 3D with SSCs and DMs... this way you can do more to your model with the existing preset, rather than write a throw away APE that will just clutter peoples effect menu. Besides its a lot harder to do decent 3D with superscopes and DMs only. I realise that Multi Filter is a bit like this at the moment.. only doing existing effects faster.. but if my damned computer with its source on would stop breaking I'd release a new version with some neat new effects, and some major optimisations from the first.<br />
      <br />
      And 16000 points??? Why??<br />
      <br />
      The best APEs are things like Texer and Color Map.. where they are generally useful as part of many presets, and offer customisation and new effects.</p>

      Well I think it was pretty lame...<br />
      <br />
      Just the first thing I could think of once I had written (and used it to debug) my DrawLine() function<br />
      <br />
      the advantage of using APEs is working in C++<br />
      <br />
      In particular, this allows me to store data in arrays, and to avoid those tiny edit boxes in AVS<br />
      <br />
      I may generalise some of the major benefits into a reuseable APE:<br />
      - store data in arrays<br />
      - serialise and deserialise to an external text file - which makes editing the settings easier - especially if I want to include large 3D data point sets<br />
      <br />
      I have no problem sharing my source code<br />
      I want to tidy it up a bit first<br />
      I actually dont have the source code to that APE anymore - I've hacked it in to something else, but I'll save sharing that until I've done something worth while<br />
      <br />
      What would be cool would be to draw 3D models in another tool and then export the data into a format that could be read into an winamp AVS file<br />
      <br />
      Something better than AVS had better come along soon...<br />
      <br />
      Oh yea<br />
      I mentioned the problem of over crowding the effect list in my previous thread (the one about the Satellite and or Daffodil)<br />
      I can write one APE that allows the user to enter the name of a file (say .dll) that exports the specific render code for that preset<br />
      <br />
      I am still curious to find out what people think of the idea of coding ape's in this way instead of avs's, given that I can keep the effect list uncluttered</p>

      <p class="post-content">Preset specific apes are pretty lame i think. The best apes are that can be used for multiple purposes and can be customized by the user. Like Colormap, Texer &amp; Convolution APE. These APE's are best because it's up to the users how they use them. Those APE's you make to replace a cluttered effect list have only one purpose, to display the what-ever shape/image it is you have coded. If you're going to code APE's instead of AVS, it's just best to code your own plugins straight away and not involve avs into it, because basicly that's what you're doing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yup, Tugg is correct<br />
      <br />
      If you wanna code so much then leave avs and use windows media player vis.</p>

      <p class="post-content">An AVS preset composed by a single preset specific APE ? Thats a weird idea...If you really want to do a cool APE and useful to the community try making an Advanced Moving Particle or a cooler water effect :) Those would be cool IMO.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Coding an APE for this purpose is pointless really as an APE but a good exercise to devolping new ideas.<br />
      Think of it as a work in progress you never know if enough options and tweaks (that cannot be done with the current instruction set with AVS) are used it maybecome a usable AVS. IF not you have more experience for next time.<br />
      <br />
      Dispute some critism from some, good effort.</p>
