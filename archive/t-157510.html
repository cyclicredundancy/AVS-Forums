      Here I announce the name of my next pack ( clever huh ;) )<br />
      Anyway, This pack hs changed tac slightly. It is going to consist of new presets as ( hopefully ) some remixes done by you guys.<br />
      My last topic about this was ignored.<br />
      But I won't go away ;)<br />
      I need people to pitch in some remixes while I pack in the Dragon-made presets :D<br />
      <br />
      Happy remixing,<br />
      Dragon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heres a little demo of how the pack is progressing.<br />
      It needs alot of help.<br />
      I can't remix ALL of my own works.<br />
      ( and I won't go away till I get help by the way. )<br />
      Anyway, there are a few new Presets. One of which is MIIIGHTY trippy.<br />
      My style. Boring as ever. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like Strike Command best of these.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Cheers dude.<br />
      I think I still have some more touch ups to do on 'Strike Command' before a final version is reached.<br />
      I think 'Mental Orgasm' is my best ever preset so far, I really like the style of that one.</p>
