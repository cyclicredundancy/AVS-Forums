		I made these two, and I figure that somewhere out there there are ones just like them, I figure them to be fairly simplistic by any and all standards...<br />
<br />
Subspace is the &quot;vanilla&quot; version, the roudier the music the better.  Also the &quot;motion effect&quot; that sorta sits all by itself is there to make text &quot;warp out&quot; once it fades out... I think it's a nifty touch :)<br />
<br />
Damaged Subspace is a &quot;remixed&quot; version sorta based on some of the effects seen in Star Trek Nemesis with panels and such pixelating and having problems...<br />
<br />
Critique away...

		Damaged one looks much better..would be good enough if you added more colours using a channel shift or colour map

		Hmm, a BlizzForums vet :D<br />
<br />
Welcome elcap...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'd have to agree with Shreyas... Channel shift won't work too well, colormap would when done right - Pick the right colors and positions though... because of the low contrast, it might be a bit tricky.<br />
<br />
Good luck climbing the 1337ness ladder <i>here</i> ;)

		The color you have now is good, but if it were brighter it would look better.  Not too terrible for a first time though.  All I have to say is the usual, learn the code, play around with stuff, and don't give up unless your hoplessly addicted to it. :winamp:

		Nic01, I have no intentions on climbing any l33tn3ss ladder here :)  I just got sick of people saying &quot;I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THIS TO WORK&quot; in Blizzforums WIP section :)

		Thanks for the suggestions... my next one will definitely have more color... if I can get the dern superscope to do my evil bidding.<br />
<br />
It enrages me to no end when I tell it to do something and it does it... differently than I want :P  I passed differential equasions for great jebus's sake!  It shouldn't be that hard! :P
