			<strong>Accidental atom...</strong><br />
		
		

		I know I myself put an end to that whole 'atom' thing...but then this happened (by accident actually).  Thought it looked fairly cool as far as the classical representation went, but I guess I have to concede to the ones who said it wouldn't be much to look at even if done well.<br />
This runs at about 11 fps on my lagger system even when docked.:mad:  You may need to adjust the number of frames in the second effect list. And perhaps a DM would be better than the roto blitter? (of course the roto blitter was the accident that made this happen!)<br />
whatcha think?<br />
<br />
Oh, and next challenge: A black whole.  One that maybe moves around and sucks up the colorful beats...or something...<br />
<br />
S~

			<strong>Atom... bah looks nothing like a real atom !!</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		thats an atom all right, a solar systemic interpretation of and atom It was a great way of imagining an atom back in the 18th century...<br />
<br />
Nahhhhh ! I'm not having a go at ya mate.. I just wanna show ya my atom it uses nothing but a couple of SSC's using some dodgy rotational matrix that I've been using to all different uses except the one I've been trying for. So I use it cange it and it changes into something completly different. But it has interesting results sometimes.<br />
<br />
Imagine a Carbon atom attached to four other carbon atoms in an organic molecule all sharing their electrons...  oh yumm I've got wood. :up: <br />
<br />
This is also a preview to what my AVS pack might contain ((ass I said this is JUST a couple of SSC's) not an actual finnished preset)<br />

		The 'challenge' was to make a more classical representation of an atom.  <br />
Looked at yours...hmmm...doesn't seem atomish to me.

		Then again I would be suprised if a superscope on its own atomished anyone.. Allthough I'm sure mine is more accurate to a &quot;real' atom bonded to four others <br />
<br />
you know I'd be happy to challenge ya on this one Bro .. one junior member to another .. <br />
