<div class="posttext">I am trying to make a preset that is like pong with the paddles and the ball and the ball will bounce off the paddles.<br />
<br />
The ball is moving OK but it sometimes it goes off the screen. Is there a way to make the ball go off one side of the screen and come back on the other with a SSC?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That is the simplest of your problems, there is no way you're making a working pong preset without collisions, otherwise it will lose it's novelty and just be a big shit. I'm working on something similar but i'm nowhere close. Fucking collisions, crappy variables.<br />
<br />
Edit: (yes someone on this damned forum can use the fucking edit button), This would make a simple line come on and start again when it leaves:<br />
<br />
Init:<br />
n=2:<br />
Frame:<br />
t=if(above(t,2),-1,t+speed);<br />
Pixel:<br />
x=i-t;<br />
y=0;<br />
<br />
That does what you want, i think you can figure out how to use it somehow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">...honestly i don't see what the big deal is.  i could code a pong sim in 15 mins if i wanted...keeping score would be easy, you'd just need a variable tracker (search the forums, a couple of people have made them...but i don't see what the big deal about those are either...)<br />
no offense meant, it just doesn't seem that much of a challenge to me...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i see how it would be easy, although coding in for &quot;mistakes&quot; would be harder</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You mean like this?<br />
<br />
Just keep track of the ball's direction of movement and bounce it off the edges... with some extra game logic to make it skew off if you hit it off-center and such ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Shit UnconeD that's great. :D<br />
<br />
lol, here's a dos based game I made some time ago. Pretty screwed game I agree and runs fast as hell if you have a reasonably fast pc, but I have included the source in case anybody wants to modify.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, pong is easy to do.  The collisions aren't difficult to simulate at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You couldn't believe the enormous smile on my face when I saw that. Good job UnConeD!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Great job using only one superscope UnConeD, really nice.<br />
Only thing I can see wrong with it is that the ball sometimes goes through the paddle, it's good enough for me though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">UnConeD, i bet that per frame code is even longer than Atero's :D<br />
Nice pong, but i guess it would be a bitch to turn it into a real music visualization preset...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol. Nice work Unconed, how long did it took you to make it?</div></div><hr />

UnConeD, i bet that per frame code is even longer than Atero's :DFuck no, my flocks scope frame section is a helluvalot longer than that.<br />
I don't see why you did the ball AND the paddles in the same scope tho.  Would've been much easier to do them seperately and texer the ball imo...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I took up Atero's challenge actually:<br />
..honestly i don't see what the big deal is. i could code a pong sim in 15 mins if i wanted...<br />
<br />
Which is why there are still a couple of bugs in it (sometimes the ball will pass through the pad when it's close to the side and moving very steeply).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It took about half an hour for me to code the actual logic behind the game. was quite easy actually.</div></div><hr />

Whatever you try, UCD has done it before or is telling you it aint possible. Somehow its just depressing</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, sometimes when you get a new idea and think its so cool, you just realize someone has already done it before and then it's not an &quot;original&quot; idea anymore:(<br />
that's why i'm naming my next pack &quot;unoriginal&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;unoriginal&quot;, how original :D So many things have been done that you have to admit that you're unoriginal to be original.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Actually i was going to name it &quot;out of ideas&quot; but since zxe had already taken up the name i decided to name it unorigrinal.</div></div><hr />
