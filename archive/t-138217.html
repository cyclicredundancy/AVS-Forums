			<strong>Pong preset</strong><br />
		
		

		I am trying to make a preset that is like pong with the paddles and the ball and the ball will bounce off the paddles.<br />
<br />
The ball is moving OK but it sometimes it goes off the screen. Is there a way to make the ball go off one side of the screen and come back on the other with a SSC?

		That is the simplest of your problems, there is no way you're making a working pong preset without collisions, otherwise it will lose it's novelty and just be a big shit. I'm working on something similar but i'm nowhere close. Fucking collisions, crappy variables.<br />
<br />
Edit: (yes someone on this damned forum can use the fucking edit button), This would make a simple line come on and start again when it leaves:<br />
<br />
Init:<br />
n=2:<br />
Frame:<br />
t=if(above(t,2),-1,t+speed);<br />
Pixel:<br />
x=i-t;<br />
y=0;<br />
<br />
That does what you want, i think you can figure out how to use it somehow.

		...honestly i don't see what the big deal is.  i could code a pong sim in 15 mins if i wanted...keeping score would be easy, you'd just need a variable tracker (search the forums, a couple of people have made them...but i don't see what the big deal about those are either...)<br />
no offense meant, it just doesn't seem that much of a challenge to me...

		You mean like this?<br />
<br />
Just keep track of the ball's direction of movement and bounce it off the edges... with some extra game logic to make it skew off if you hit it off-center and such ;).

		Shit UnconeD that's great. :D<br />
<br />
lol, here's a dos based game I made some time ago. Pretty screwed game I agree and runs fast as hell if you have a reasonably fast pc, but I have included the source in case anybody wants to modify.

		Yeah, pong is easy to do.  The collisions aren't difficult to simulate at all.

		Great job using only one superscope UnConeD, really nice.<br />
Only thing I can see wrong with it is that the ball sometimes goes through the paddle, it's good enough for me though.

		UnConeD, i bet that per frame code is even longer than Atero's :D<br />
Nice pong, but i guess it would be a bitch to turn it into a real music visualization preset...

Fuck no, my flocks scope frame section is a helluvalot longer than that.<br />
I don't see why you did the ball AND the paddles in the same scope tho.  Would've been much easier to do them seperately and texer the ball imo...

		I took up Atero's challenge actually:<br />

	<blockquote>
			
				..honestly i don't see what the big deal is. i could code a pong sim in 15 mins if i wanted...</blockquote>
Which is why there are still a couple of bugs in it (sometimes the ball will pass through the pad when it's close to the side and moving very steeply).

		It took about half an hour for me to code the actual logic behind the game. was quite easy actually.

		Yes, sometimes when you get a new idea and think its so cool, you just realize someone has already done it before and then it's not an &quot;original&quot; idea anymore:(<br />
that's why i'm naming my next pack &quot;unoriginal&quot;

		&quot;unoriginal&quot;, how original :D So many things have been done that you have to admit that you're unoriginal to be original.

		Actually i was going to name it &quot;out of ideas&quot; but since zxe had already taken up the name i decided to name it unorigrinal.
