			<strong>Disguise AVS, can it be done?</strong><br />
		
		

		Is there a way to disguise AVS so if I sell my custom work to Clubs they can't figure out what program I'm using? That way I can get paid on a monthly basis and nobody will steal my job.

		And I'm not sure if it's legal. Nullsoft has copyrights on AVS, it's in the about screen. You cannot use it to make any kind of profit out of it.

		In my post I said &quot;custom work&quot; like special event announcements and things like that, only artwork that I made, something that would display every 5 minutes then go to a black screen. Nevermind it's a bad Idea.

		Yeah avs isn't exactly ideal for &quot;video displaying&quot; or even pure Vj:ing, it crashes often and is really slow even at low resolutions. Also beat detection tends to fuck up every now &amp; then, detecting 10247895 beats per minute or something.<br />
<br />
Also i can't understand why people are trying to get money out of avs/avsing, a lot of people (well 99%) do this for free as their hobby and don't get paid for it, the participation in this wonderful art form &amp; community is enough for them :)<br />
<br />
Also why use AVS when there are so much better options to Vj:ing (as i assume you know)? Just because someone has done awesome presets doesn't necessarely mean that it's good for highresolution projecting.<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
AVS for making money? :igor:
