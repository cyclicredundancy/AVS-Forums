      <p class="post-content">real but not AVS.I dont think you can simulate and coordinate the moves and bounces of the buggy with the terrain.Or if you could i think it would take ages.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it's real. I think it's one of those voxel terrains you made for Mission for Mars. You just need the height of the piece of voxel terrain the buggy is on. I think you can then simulate the bouncing like I did in my Gravity preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If that is real it is awesome. I don't think that it would be possible to figure out the height of the terrain if it is voxel. Unless if you made it a SSC terrain and sped up the avi file...</p>

      <p class="post-content">It is quite real, but the buggy's physics are proving to be a big, big pain. The car has to tilt in all directions and has to have realistic gravity effects (i.e. it has to be able to take a jump of a hill).<br />
      <br />
      Oh and the voxels are updated from mission to mars too: I've added a trick that fakes up/down rotation (voxel-engines usually only have left/right rotation)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well pardon me for saying this, but i think you make the best presets now that you have quit doing avs fulltime :)<br />
      <br />
      Before i got the feeling from your packs that you <b>had</b> to prove yourself somehow and the presets weren't always nothing but technical show off's. Now that you do it for <i>fun</i> you seem to be making these kick ass presets that i have enjoyed even more than any of your whacko series.<br />

      :D<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      geez...That is by far the most avs-boundary-pushing preset i have ever seen..<br />
      <br />
      that is if it really IS an avs preset:<br />
      <br />
      How the fuck did you manage to put in the shadow of the moon buggy, in AVfrickenS??<br />
      <br />
      AND How the fuck did you manage a 3d scope, with the entire voxelmap's height programmed, so as to provide for a 'real-looking' physix engine featuring collisions and grav, all within the variable limit of the superscope!?!??? :eek: :weird: :eek:<br />
      <br />
      Nothing personal steve, but i refuse to believe it until i see it for myself.. Please post at least some of the code and my faith will be restored.. its not that i dont trust you, its just that i am suspiciouse....<br />

      I am clicking the post button now at extreamely high risk of being flammed, recieving 3rd degree burns all over.<br />

      <p class="post-content">this is 5 world class presets almost finished and its been what, a few months since you left and wouldn't come back to the forums or avs because you had no ideas. We never asked you to be as active as you once were all we ask is that next time you toy around in your spare time for about an hour and out-avs the rest of us for years to come ;) you withhold it until you have 10 more sweet world class presets, make an intro in your spare time and shove it out there. This is my final plea and i won't harass you any longer or mention it again if you refuse. It's just that you could've been half way there already and it's rather obvious you want to avs. So, final plea.</p>

      <p class="post-content">axer: that py line is the terrain, composed of several octaves of sines. You can change it around if you don't mind copy/pasting it to all the other scopes ;). Same for the shading. I know it looks kind of oceanish, I could try making it more crater-shaded but that would probably be slower.<br />
      <br />
      Btw Raz, that line could use a lot of optimizing... e.g.<br />
      "sin(s*0.03)*cos(s*0.1)*5-cos(s*0.1))"<br />
      =<br />
      "(sin(s*0.03)*5-1)*cos(s*0.1))"<br />
      <br />
      If you further cache s*0.1 (a commonly used value in your code), you can get rid of a lot of multiplies. Remember that getting rid of one statement in a DM means getting rid of gridsize-amount of operations, for a 20x20 DM that means 400 operations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol.. what a bitch of a thing to do..<br />
      <br />
      whatdo you mean about 'the details'? if your wondering why im so curious of your code, it was cuz i finally decided to try and work out how you did the whole voxel terrain thing..<br />
      <br />
      ive now decided that anything that requires more than 5 ssc's for any result isnt worth the headfuck!<br />
      <br />
      btw: i think that the terrain map from mision to mars was nicer. this one seems too bumpy, which doesnt work aswell because the voxels are so inprecise along xaxis. But then again, if you used a smoother map, the buggy physics wouldnt be as noticable.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the glob vars hack uses the spectroscope stuff to store variables. These variables can then be accessed using getspec(). Don't think we'll ever see this released though. Just wait for the next avs update.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Bah I'll explain it again... the globvars hack is really, really, really unuseful. Here's how it works:<br />
      <br />
      - Dot superscope calculates values, and draws them as colored pixels in the upper left corner, first row.<br />
      - Globvars hack reads those values and inserts them into the getosc data.<br />
      - Other components read those values as getosc.<br />
      <br />
      Limitations:<br />
      - Range is 0..1 for input, -1...1 for output, so you have to rescale your range so it fits into that<br />
      - Precision is 1/255, not good for large ranges.<br />
      <br />
      Because the typical 'read-in' code is quite large per scope, it's seriously not the way to go when you just need a global rand(). In this case you should use a regular getosc. It's only useful if you really, really need to do some complex calculations on a var that cannot be duplicated.<br />
      <br />
      In its current state it's non-configurable and I'm sure if I released it as "Global Variables Hack" I'd get tons of people asking "I put in teh global var appe in my presetz and then in my scope I put foo=2 and in anoter scope it is not 2???? PLZ HLP!!1!!!".</p>

      <p class="post-content">Too bad... I hoped for something like an APE in which you can define vars that apply to all objects so that you don't have to re-type everyting for every item, so that it speeds things up a bit...<br />

      <p class="post-content">im sure you could make some sort of global variables effect list.<br />
      <br />
      Well, not really an effect list, but an APE that can import other APE's such as ssc's and dm's. You could maybe have specific globes assigned for all APE's within the 'effect list'.<br />
      <br />
      Then again, this may be a pipe dream, my c knowledge isnt sparkly enough to justify the claim.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, can you use the 'b' switch as a globe ucd? or is it predefined as boolean..<br />
      <br />
      all of this would be so easy if we had source. =(<br />
      isnt one of us able to make a ssc and dm replica with the neccesary improvs?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The problem is mainly the scripting language. The actual DM/SSC mechanics are not that hard.<br />
      <br />
      I don't have time to implement AVS' scripting language completely (though it is possible), plus I really don't want to reinvent the wheel. It's up to nullsoft to make the scripting engine available to APEs, not the other way around.</p>

      <p class="post-content">open source would be good but it could be risk due to all of the potential n00b "updates" and "clever add-ons". it is unlikely that the scripting engine is made for avs, probably just a bought or freeware header.

      <p class="post-content">we wouldn't have to make a scripting engine that was different though, we could emulate it completely using tools like flex and bison. as far as clever n00b add-ins and the like, if we ran a truly open source project, they would have to be contributed back to the project, and approved to get into the source tree. not everyone gets read/write access to the cvs tree.<br />
      <br />
      u are right that there are more than just one capable programmer in the community, and i would like to consider myself one. however, the fact that i dont boot into windows very often now would probably pose a problem. although... it would be totally awesome to build a cross-platform version that you could have the option of building for either xmms or winamp3 :) and that is totally possible... all we would have to do is write the windowing/drawing code using something portable like sdl, and then just make sure that we can get the language parser to work on both, and we're golden :) my offer still stands. if anyone is interested, this is a project that i will probably start in the near future.</p>
