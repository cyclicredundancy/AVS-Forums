<div class="posttext">Hey guys, I've recently gotten back into AVS and I'm really liking the presets that I'm creating.  I'm hoping to share my second pack (my first was at least a year ago under a different name) in a couple of weeks here.  But first I have to finish my finals :igor: <br />
Anyways, there is a dynamic movement that would fit well into a few of my presets, but I don't know how accomplish it.  Basically, I want to place the camera in the middle of a sphere with the AVS window as the inside of the sphere so that the middle looks further away than the edges.  If possible, I would then like to either/or change the radius of the sphere or move the camera closer/farther from the edge of the sphere so it can dance with the beat more.<br />
Anyways, if anyone could help me with this or show me where to look to figure it out on my own I would really appreciate it.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Andy</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The way most people are doing fancy 3D dm like this, is by using raytracing. You can search in the forms for threads about raytracing and you should come up with a good start.</div></div><hr />
