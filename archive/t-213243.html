<div class="posttext">i desided i might as well made a few more presets, and maybe submit them (if those who are familar with my previous work 'Blurpak')<br />
<br />
anywho, it is exactly what it says. If you're familar with em (more then likey you might not be), you;d know its a nice gadget that helps search for spikes (signals) in rf spectrums (hence the name)<br />
<br />
if anyone could recode all them pesky superscopes (the grid more preferibly, into one cpu-friendly scope, i'd apprechate it! :D<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if anyone has done it before, but heck, i thought it looked good. (cus i was bored you know)<br />
kinda sucked that i had to redo it when winamp crashed for some reason :3<br />
<br />
enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">okay, after going through a bit of PAK's tourital<br />
<br />
i sorta optimised it a little; got rid of all those damn 2point SSC's that made up the 'grid' and made two ssc's instead that did all the work for me<br />
<br />
i also moved the rander/text's so it was better arranged. and i dumped the '7's<br />
oh and changed the blur to a light blur :)<br />
