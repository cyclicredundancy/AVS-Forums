      <p class="post-content"><strong>Capturing visualization as a still image?</strong><br />
      There have been some posts as how to capture visualizations as .AVI files (movies), but I can't see any on this subject.<br />
      <br />
      I'd like to use the visualization as a wallpaper on my desktop, and<br />
      ctrl-printscreen doesn't work (atleast not in full-screen, i want the whole 1600x1200 image, not just the small screen.. you know what I mean)...<br />
      <br />
      Is there a feature within AVS or WinAmp that allows users to copy the current frame or something like that?<br />
      <br />
      BTW.<br />
      Can anyone tell me why WinAmp 3 takes forever to load on my new ultra-powerful 3.0GHz/1GB PC2700-DDR RAM computer?<br />
      Does it just suck that much or am i doing something wrong? :mad:</p>

      <p class="post-content">uh...try pressing print-screen alone(use alt+print screen to take a screenshot of the active window) when in fulscreen mode then use a bmp software( kinda like paint shop pro) to paste it ,then set it as wallpaper.<br />
      Yes WA3 takes a lot of time to load, so i use WA2.91 to make AVS.<br />
      so your computer has lots of speed, but what about its HD space? 1GB is'nt much you know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could also use hotlist to make screenshots. There you'll get a quick preview so you can refresh until you find the screenshot worthy to save, then just click save to file. Works a lot smarter than doing trial &amp; error with some photoediting tool :D</p>
