<div class="posttext">Nice 3D Graphics <br />
Very dark colours - I suggest dimming the lights a bit<br />
A few surprises if you watch for a while</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another coder has landed on the forums... Welcome :up:<br />
<br />
Too bad tho that i don't like the overall looks of this preset too much. Imo the mosaic effect looks bad and does not really fit into the preset, also using subtractive 2 with the ship makes it look rather nasty and xor:ish ( which some people like, but some hate. i.e. Me hate, Atero like :p ) Anyway, i just don't think that adding a ship that just rotates in front of some weird stuff is enough, you could basicly make two presets out of this, one with the background scopes and some nice effects and one with the ship flying through space or other whatnot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree with Tug, though I like the techniques you used a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, the preset has almost no beat response but the coding is nice:up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just get the aesthetics down right, and you're good to go!  Well, maybe a few other things too, but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
That X-wing fighter looks very real.  Nice job with coding on that :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice x-wing, but it's colors are horrible.  The background also is pretty bad.<br />
<br />
A good background would be a custom SSC starfield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice x-wing. Bad Background. Next time try using acos(-1) for pi instead of of typing out the number. It's a lot simpler.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sweet coding!  Need to work on your background, as the other people already said.  Next thing you might consider working on is a DM to create a moving &quot;terrain&quot;<br />
<br />
BTW:  I like the surprise you mentioned</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That is some really good coding for the X-Wing scope, you must have had a lot of free time.</div></div><hr />
