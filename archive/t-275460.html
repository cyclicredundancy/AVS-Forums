<div class="posttext">Im the noob Sandar Kleven, if that means anything to you, the noob who... never mind<br />
<br />
This is my fourth pack, its noobish, but much better than my old stuff. Therefore, id like to say its my first...<br />
<br />
Tried uploading it on winamp plugins area, but it fucks up!<br />
So ill try here<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
Presets:<br />
The bigg rift in hell <br />
Wierd techno lights <br />
Ribbon <br />
Somewhere in the mind of a nerd (A take on of &quot;Somewhere between the legs of a hooker&quot;)<br />
Spotlights <br />
Metallic (Grudge meets SKOGSKLOCKA) <br />
Live (Les Noobiens!)<br />
<br />
Aswell as a bonus preset (Made entirely by me, albeit by accident)<br />
<br />
Thats it I think...<br />
Most of these are remixes, but hopefully you will like 'em!<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Not bad. Are you planning on making more originals, or do you mostly remix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Headphoneguy</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th August 2007, 00:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">in my other presets i mostly did remixes.<br />
<br />
as for new presets: unless i am able to make some decent presets, this might be all.<br />
<br />
*goes off to download a whole lot of visuals...only to find out the computer is fucked*<br />
<br />
Update: my computer works again, some sort of hardware issue which stopped most components (Hard drive etc. and the screen)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">not bad. but you really should stop calling yourself a noob. that's not going to get you any respect or recognition. that's my opinion at least.<br />
that matrix code looks pretty good. <br />
cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th August 2007, 15:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yup, I agree; The matrix code is pretty cool. Maybe you can make a second version of it with some music responsiveness. There are some really excellent tutorials like AVS for Winamp: Tutorial by pIR (http://pcharpen.club.fr/avs/avs2_tut_en.pdf) and AVS Programming guide by PAK-9 (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/). If you are tired of calling yourself a noob, prehaps you can take a look at them :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks everybody<br />
I have one more, just noticed it, made some changes and thought it was good:<br />
Its a speaker, originally with colors, but i liked it better black n white...<br />
<br />
Prolly good for emos...hehe<br />
<br />
EDIT: Come to think of it, it WAS better w/colors. So change em yourself or ask me for the orig.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: WTF is up with winamp? Cant they finish their new site:mad:. Besides, what was wrong with the old one? i liked it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th August 2007, 21:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nice effects!<br />
<br />
You have a blank color map in the middle of the preset you could get rid of. Also, the Trans/Bump does not move (it's stuck at (0.5,0.5) check the code) and the only difference it makes without it is the preset runs a lot more efficient. I noticed you have a frame limiter in your preset, but I don'thave the APE. What frame rate did you set it to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Headphoneguy</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th August 2007, 21:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">the main reason i have the frame rate limiter is for better viewing, sometimes, if you listen to slow music, its a good idea to turn the framerate lower.<br />
<br />
The color map is there cause the preset originally had colors, if its looks better? you decide!<br />
<br />
heres the one with colors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th August 2007, 21:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">How about this color map?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Headphoneguy</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th August 2007, 22:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hehe...owned<br />
Yeah its much better</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Since discovering this forum, I've gained a love of remixing presets. Mucho funero. This actually started as the emo version.  Not so emo anymore though.<br />
Also, i have a newfound fondness of convolution filters.<br />
Still not exactly sure how it works, but it does some interesting things to the image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">11th August 2007, 03:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Woah, psychedelic.<br />
<br />
Here is a poor explination of the convo filter. The convolution filter copies each pixel to a new position, relative to it's old position. The new position is determined by which boxes have values in them, and the brightness is determined by that value. The bias box at the bottom adds the bias value to the total brightness, and the scaling box divides the total brightness by its value (after the bias is worked out). Hopefully that helps just a bit.<br />
<br />
I made a preset you can tinker with to see the effects of the convo filter. There are grey boxes behind some examples so you can kinda see the darkened area. I would have done 3 more examples if AVS didn't crash Winamp so many times. BTW, don't mind the extremely slow frame rate. There is no movement so it shouldn't matter anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks shatered view<br />

<br />
Speaking of the speaker preset<br />
I have more originals<br />
<br />
The orig fireball, Techno lights, and a speaker variation...<br />
Their not THAT intresting, but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Headphoneguy</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th August 2007, 15:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wierd, the orig. lights tiles are suposed to go to the top and bottom, why does it work on one computer and not the other???<br />
Some thing wrong with the movement?</div></div><hr />

<br />
looking at the values used for scaling, it's no surprise it's slow.. use anything 2^n for better speed (if necessary tweak the grid to get there)</div></div><hr />
