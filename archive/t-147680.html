      <p class="post-content"><strong>I'm back... and w/out shareware</strong><br />
      Hey all.<br />
      <br />
      You might remember me from "The Random Collection" You know... the thing that showed how much a guy can screw up in 24 hours... Anyways... I've found some time to play around with AVS some more and ought to have a re-relase of the old pack with some decent presets in it and NO SHAREWARE garbage in a few more months from now. Just some questions...<br />
      <br />
      1) Is anyone still holding a grudge?<br />
      <br />
      2) Is there an easy way to fill the screen with a solid color or a gradient by using a superscope?<br />
      <br />
      3) Are there any good AVS tutorials out there?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">A quick look through the bowels of the site turned up nothing that says you can't make money from your AVS presets... although I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to make money from OTHER people's presets. If it's really an issue that needs solving, someone could e-mail the folks at Nullsoft and ask 'em directly.<br />
      <br />
      Also: is it possible to create a screen-filling color gradient with the Color Map? Or is a SSC the only way to do it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not with colormap directly. To create more advanced (albiet less dynamic) effects, you can create a black to white gradient then customize it in colormap.</p>

      <p class="post-content">A color map only changes color on the already rendered screen according to color intensity. You therefor have to render a gradient screen (in any way you want), and you can color that with ColorMap.<br />
      <br />
      I agree with Rovastar, I don't think it's wrong to make money out of presets you made by yourself, but it's not quite the avs ethos.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using Winamp to make money illegal. I wouldn't have thought so what about all these plugins taht peopel have to buy. What is the difference you need Winamp to run them.<br />
      <br />
      I hope Nullsoft don't start sueing all the VJ-types that use AVS and get paid in clubs, etc.<br />
      <br />
      If it is your own stuff you have written no problem but other peoples stuff. No-no.<br />
      <br />
      I look at it the same as I do my MilKDrop stuff I have the IP rights to my stuff I do with as I please.:) LEgally I think Nullsoft will actually strugle (if they ever did follow that path (I doubt it anyway) but the bad PR will be intense) I see it like making a picture in Photoshop.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well as far as i know, the avs "help" screen does say something like "You are free to use it at parties, clubs etc." So i guess Vj:ing is ok, and i also guess that shareware avs isn't illegal either (just a guess). But wheter or not it is illegal/legal, it is still pretty much judged by the community. No one here at the forums is making money out of their beloved hobby so naturally people get upset when someone comes and tries to make a profit out of it.</p>

      Clearscreen in one colour.. allows you to clear the screen in a way different to Dynamic Clear Screen APE if you really need to. DCS is pretty useful for this though if you don't want synching or some specific pattern of colors.. and its slightly faster.</p>
