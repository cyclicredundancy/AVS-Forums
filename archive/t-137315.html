		I wasn't trying to change the subject. I was just complementing Horse-Fly on his avatar. Does that really stop you guys from staying on topic? I don't &quot;design&quot; a post to get off subject. You just need to chill,Atero.<br />

		first, PM Sawg and tell him you want a deluxe membership.  This costs $10.00 / year.  You can use either PayPal or a credit card.<br />
<br />
Then, you make your avatar.  It has to be 50x50 or less and the filesize less than 100KB<br />
<br />
my control panel --&gt; edit options and upload it.  you will have an avatar next to your name!

		fuck reading this page is funny. i haven't been here in shit-long a time, so um... <font size="1">did ya miss me? :p</font><br />
<br />
i thought ever since &quot;the bra&quot; thread, AVS was destined to co-exist with pr0n. anyway, we are all good little code monkeys arn't we? so of course not having a girlfriend for the past 3 years has done damage and now the only way we can get off is through porn ;)

		I just wonder how much longer this thread is going to last. It was all most dead. And yes it has gone off topic but it's not like any didn't see it coming. :)

ummm...you can do that with Google too.  If you read the thread, you would realize that I only wanted to see what ELSE came up for AVS besides the Winamp AVS. <br />
<br />
oh...and why the hell are you here?  I don't look at pr0n, but because this is the first time I've seen you here, it looks as if you searched for &quot;porn&quot; or just posted here becasue you saw the word porn and wanted some.<br />
<br />
Requesting lock.
