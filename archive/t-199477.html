      <p class="post-content"><strong>Something to think about (interesting)</strong><br />
      try using a supercomputer for AvS, well thats <b>CRAP</b>, now forget most the stuff about computers and try to imagine a supercomputer x 5 ... [ the new server computers with like 80 cpus, eh 70 gig ram, ] now basically this pc sux about to what ill tell you: this is probably for ur awareness try looking up "Quantum Computer", in the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikapedia</a>?<br />
      in english it can do multiple calculations making it the best computer in the world bla bla bla...<br />
      yeah so anyways i wanna test this with avs... :) (i want one of these!! ), so u could probably run avs without a glitch ... + 1,000,000 others... :P imagine the possibilities...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, but you do realise you'll never get a chance to use one. And the most likely do not run windows. It would still be cool, but then wouldn't you get a giant framerate and the preset woul run too fast?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not to mention that AVS has only recently gained multiprocessor support which is most likely crap and buggy, because there probably haven't been all that much testing of it.<br />
      And then there is probably the thing about how fast data moves between processor and memory and yada yada yada :blah::blah::blah:</p>

      <p class="post-content">and there is the resistance of the copperwires on the logic boards, you <i>really</i> need fiber optics as minimum and don't forget the time it takes for the light to beam from your monitor to your eyes and then your brain needs to translate that to an image which takes time too. (takes a deep breath) How about ... ah whatever...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thought about it.<br />
      Realized that none of the no people who own such a non-existing system wants to test it with AVS.<br />
      <br />
      What UR probl3m is? Dig through the forums and read how we write. Compare that with your own shoutings. For this thread: <i>We</i> realize that talking about quantum computers is useless as they are good as fictional anyway. So what is it that you want then? Tell us that AVS is slow?<br />
      We allready know that since there are well over <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php?s=&amp;action=showresults&amp;searchid=2280612&amp;sortby=lastpost&amp;sortorder=descending" target="_blank">227</a> threads about just that that.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I was just thinking about when I was 15, what school was like, and the teachers. Looking back, everybody's favorite teachers(the hippy-trippy ones, who replaced the desks with sofas and comfy chairs, and didn't challenge you too much), weren't very good teachers. Everybody's least favorite teachers(the ones who challenged you, expected you to do the work, and show how you did it, and didn't let you slide by, not even once), were really good teachers.<br />
      <br />
      I realize that all sounds really off topic. I'm just trying to see the forum from your perspective. I don't think it's a good idea to play the "I'm only 15" card too much. Wait till you've made some super-fantastic preset that blows us all away, then say "I'm only 15" it will be a lot more impressive. Also remember this is at best a hobby, and an artform, you choose to do it because it's fun. If it's not fun, then find something else you think is fun, like 3D modelling, or painting, or heck even gaming. I don't think there's any point to doing this if it's not fun for you.<br />
      <br />
      Just do what WarriorO/TLight says, write down the math and then put it into the editor in the appropriate places and see what happens.<br />
      <br />
      All the talk of Deep Thought, has to do with a combination of things, first of all The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy(really it's a series but I still think of it as a trilogy) of books. Click the link in sidd's post, you'll understand easily. Maybe you could read the books, I read them when I was about 12, but then my appetite for books is voracious, most folks read it the first time when they're right about your age I think. It's sci-fi at it's best, very clever with a great deal of humour.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and have you tried changing numbers and parameters in different formulas? It really helps you to learn what certain things do, and how they work. I'm a beginner too, but just following some of the guides and tutorials out there is helping me a lot(I think). Also have you tried enterring any of them into a scientific calculator? Often times it tells you that values are missing...that should tell you something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Quantum computers are almost totally theoretical, it is more of a concept than a realistic approach to processing at our current technological level... the 'cold fusion' of the processor world if you will. If you had wiki'd for the topic yourself you would probably have found that out.<br />
      <br />
      As for the reason all your topics get blasted and locked in ph33r of flamewars, I really dont know. You seem to have a 'crapas touch'... maybe if you tried pasting your text into word and running the grammar and spellcheck, so at least people could understand what you are trying to convey. I usually just derive the point of your threads from others posts because your text is so hard to understand.</p>
