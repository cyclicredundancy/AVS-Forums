		For all those who care, Volume 6 should be coming out as soon as the forums pack is released. But here's a preview preset.<br />
Tell me what you think.

		nice preset! Perhaps you could smooth out the movement of the squares a bit? In my eyes they jump a bit too volatile. Probalby that would also bring in more color and remove some more grey. That's all. Nevertheless, nice idea! :up:

		^..^ if you click, you get colour. there's not much i can do about the movent without a lot more code, and that gave me a headache enough.<br />
Wotl, yes they are supposed to have edges, both big and small squares.<br />
And thanks yathosho, will do!

		Ah i see! I clicked on the screen, while no music was played and then i could see that the squares change size and color. But it's a rather marginal change?! However, i guess just some more texers (as yatosho suggested) should do the same job, with a lot less headache ;)

		i'm not a friend of interactive presets though, if used for vj'ing (purpose of visualization!?) they become pretty useless. your's is still ok, as one can click independent from the mouse position. maybe you can make two versions of this preset, one without interactivity.

		yeah, during vj-ing it can be pretty annoying if you unintentionaly change something. But shouldn't it be enough, to add a general &quot;interactivity on/off&quot; switch to the preset then? i mean so that the interactivity only works when the mouse is on the avs-screen for example. normally you use one screen to project the vis and the other one to handle winamp, right? Then some code like this can tell if the mouse is on the avs screen or not: <br />
<pre><code><br />
inside=below(abs(getkbmouse(1)),1) &amp;<br />
       below(abs(getkbmouse(2)),1);<br />
</code></pre>

guess that's still ok, but it's lame to see the mouse and the interface on your projection :)

		For sure! Actually i didn't think of menus, but just of having some (hidden) control about such simple things like color schemes or so. <br />
Although it's pretty cool to have menus and a cursor etc. if you use them in Winamp!

		A lot of people do what you have done with the old random-convolution-filter, in this case it doesnt really matter because the preset is so fast, but its usually worth seeing if the same effect can be achieved with less data in the convolution filter. Convolving is a very expensive operation, try to cut it down wherever you can...<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
also reg00=(reg00+getkbmouse(3))&amp;1 will swap reg00 every frame, which isnt what you want, open the debug window and watch it switch back and forth. You need a locking variable<br />
<br />
reg00=if(band(bnot(locked),getkbmouse(3)),bnot(reg00),reg00);<br />
locked=getkbmouse(3);<br />
<br />

		hmm i always used:<br />
<pre><code>reg00 =( reg00 + band(getkbmouse(3),stop) )%2;<br />
stop=bnot( getkbmouse(3) )</code></pre><br />
coud it be that yours is (imperceptible) faster pak?

		Yes, because %2 is a divide operation and divides are nasty and expensive; bitwise logic is almost always faster than arithmetic.<br />
<br />
its marginally faster to use locked=bnot(getkbmouse(3)); or stop=bnot(getkbmouse(3)); as you've put it, because if you are checking the variable more than once the bnot operation only gets performed once that way. I usually dont bother tho because its less readable imo and the speed difference is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 fps

		despite of that 2 * 10^-40 fps speed boost the logical-code should be faster anyway. well, i hope you don't bother when i use your marginal faster code from now on?! ;)

		if anyone out there is even considering using my preset at parties i would be very much surprised and thankful, but i doubt anyone will so there's no real point in changing anything. and plus i've already made the installer for the pack and i'm just waiting on the release of the forum pack. the colour changing code works fine unless your a retard and hold the mouse button down for too long. just click quickly.<br />
there are more important problems with this preset than colouring and code, for instance, the texers randomly dissapearing until after a few minutes your left with a blank screen. if anyone has a solution to that actual problem i would like to hear it. and pak, the preset runs at 60fps on my machine, i don't think the convo filter is a big issue here.
