      <p class="post-content"><strong>Suggestion: custom blend mode</strong><br />
      I want custom blend mode!!! :D<br />
      How about once more option in the "Blend mode" dropdown menu, and a textfield:</p>
      <pre>
<code>blend mode: [custom]V]<br />(<u>blablabla</u>)</code>
</pre><br />
      two variables: <b>in</b> and <b>out</b>.<br />
      Here's this syntax applied to existing modes:<br />
      <pre>
<code>ignore:       out<br />replace:      in<br />50/50:        in*.5+out*.5<br />maximum:      max(in,out)<br />additive:     in+out<br />sub1:         out-in<br />sub2:         in-out<br />multiply:     in*out<br />minimum:      min(in,out)</code>
</pre><br />
      I suggest the whole thing being static, i.e. calculated once, otherwise may get too slow :P<br />
      XOR is unavalible - until AVS has a function or it.<br />
      Every other pixel and every other line can be done but it's pretty complex and slow :P.<br />
      Adjustable will be only useful if this thing will be dynamicly calculated (not static).<br />
      Also separate formulas for each channel (RGB) can be optional :)<br />
      I think this will help a lot to do such things as gradient overlays [in*x+out*(1-x)]; color tricks and frames. Well, maybe not. What does the community think?

      <p class="post-content">it would be nice if additional blend modes could be inserted by APEs. this would have the required speed for dealing with each pixel seperately.</p>

      <p class="post-content">fragmer: I don't really see this happening. The only reason blend modes are so fast is because they are coded in optimized MMX instructions.<br />
      <br />
      Using the current evallib for this, on e.g. a 320x240 preset, would mean doing the equivalent of a 76800 point superscope.<br />
      <br />
      A special version of evallib would have to be made which can compile to these instructions and which can process packed 24-bit colors (remember, evallib is only floating point). Because it would have to be dynamic, common optimizations and tricks would probably not be implemented, resulting in globally slower behaviour.<br />
      <br />
      In other words: nope.</p>

      <p class="post-content">what a pleasure to listen to a speech of an educated person :) Thanks for enlighting, UCD. I thought static custom blend modes would be not much slower then cutom movements...</p>
