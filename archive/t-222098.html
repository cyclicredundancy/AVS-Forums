      <p class="post-content">If they wanted to, they would have done it already, don't you think?<br />
      <br />
      Most of the people who created stuff before the crash have quit.<br />
      <font size="1">(read: don't care anymore/ don't even have their presets anymore)</font><br />
      The ones who're still around have their stuff online.<br />
      <br />
      Also, you'd better list the missing ones. I never downoad my own stuff and I'm pretty sure noone does frequently do that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tried to google for some packs?<br />
      <br />
      Some sites (other than winamp&amp;deviantart) host avs packs even if they don't ask the author permission for it. Like i could find my 1st pack on a russian site a long time after i took it down from winamp-com :igor:</p>
