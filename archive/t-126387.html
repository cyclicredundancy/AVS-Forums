<div class="posttext">The play presets are a bit newbish dude...They look like roto blitter + water.The &quot;badrecording&quot; preset is nice IMO :) You`ve really caught that screwed big brother effect heh</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd have to say I don't like any of them.  Bad recording has very harsh lines and I don't like how it looks.  And the play presets are roto-blitters and waters(except for number 1).  They don't react well enough and are pretty common looking presets.  Try doing something unique(bad recording is unique, but in a bad way IMO).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">LOL sorry but I fine this very funny....<br />
<br />
I offer some spare presets for people to make over and use for them for their avs packs <br />
<br />
as for newbish...let me care to remind some of you that I've been about making avs presets for years since avs started<br />
<br />
These presets are not made to be complete but only to be played around with added with your own custom style</div></div><hr />
