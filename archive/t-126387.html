      <p class="post-content">I'd have to say I don't like any of them. Bad recording has very harsh lines and I don't like how it looks. And the play presets are roto-blitters and waters(except for number 1). They don't react well enough and are pretty common looking presets. Try doing something unique(bad recording is unique, but in a bad way IMO).</p>

      <p class="post-content">LOL sorry but I fine this very funny....<br />
      <br />
      I offer some spare presets for people to make over and use for them for their avs packs<br />
      <br />
      as for newbish...let me care to remind some of you that I've been about making avs presets for years since avs started<br />
      <br />
      These presets are not made to be complete but only to be played around with added with your own custom style</p>
