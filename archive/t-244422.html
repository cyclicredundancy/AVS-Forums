			<strong>detachable toolbar</strong><br />
		
		

		Can anyone help me please.<br />
does anyone know of a skin which allows the visualisation toolbar to be detached.<br />
i use the visualisation for projecting on to a screen in a club,but i would like to be able to edit the visuals live, as i go along. i know there are keyboard shortcuts for moving to the next viz, but this often doesn't work.<br />
what i want is to have the vis playing through the projector, and the  vis editor and toolbar on my laptop screen

		the hotkeys and the editor should be enough. you can also use a midi keyboard to control the presets.

		i wished it were. please enlighten me.<br />
if i have got the editor open and make any changes to the vis, when press ctrl-u  it doesn't move on to the next vis.<br />
i have to close the editor then the shortcut key works.<br />
this is a problem as i don't want people to see what i am doing on the projector.<br />
maybe i am missing something, as winamp is new to me.

		Yeah, those hotkeys don't always work when the editor is open. (Jumping ahead to the next preset when you press U would make editing difficult, you see.)<br />
<br />
You might need to use &quot;Preset -&gt; Load&quot; instead. Some of the vis-data pauses while you do that, though, so it's probably not the best solution.<br />
<br />
Also, look at the &quot;Settings -&gt; Presets/Hotkeys&quot; screen. You can use that to jump to specific presets (if you set them up beforehand) without having to use Preset -&gt; Load, and you can also turn off the save prompt too, which may also be useful in your case. (Probably worth noting that this hotkey feature actually saves a copy of the current preset into a file named after the key.)<br />
<br />
What kind of editing do you do &quot;live&quot;?

		how can you use the midi keyboard yath? just map it to keys or something more? <br />
<br />
editing presets live is a pain since they freeze whenever you tuch anything (damn i hate that about avs). you can code in some things to tweak and then use the VJ control ape. for switching presets Hotlist is the simplest and best solution imo.

		This is why i thought a detachable toolbar might be the answer,(r u listening developers)i could live with the slight freezing issue.<br />
Steve most i the stuff would involve playing about with the trans/movement presets, and anything else i might like to play with as i go through them.<br />
i didn't want to save any changes to them after moving to the next one, but being able to edit them on the fly makes things more dynamic/interesting.:cool:

		<b>First of all:</b><br />
Use overlay, so the crowd won't see what youre working at.<br />
<br />
<b>Second:</b><br />
Try to use a second monitor for larger and more comfortable workspace if possible.<br />
<br />
<b>Third:</b><br />
Try Hotlist!<br />
It fits most of a VJ's needs in matters of flexible automized preset control and is -by now- the most advanced overhead controller for avs.<br />
<br />

-Download Version 2.2 and upgrade to 2.3RC2<br />
-you will need to install RC1 before RC2 for it to work (more information provided in the thread)<br />
-Installer coming soon!<br />
<br />
<b>Fourth:</b><br />
For Editing on the fly i would also recommend you to use the vj.ape. Messing with code during a performance is allways bad, better if you have preassigned controls which will behave the way you designed them to.

		i'd also recommend the use of <i>vis_avsmod.dll</i> as it has a bigger workspace, useful dock-in-editor mode and much faster controls than going to the menus.<br />

		i recommend the use of <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7800156/" target="_blank">aperesize.ape</a> over vis_avsmod.dll.<br />
it allows you to change the size of the editor dynamically.<br />
if you want a bigger &quot;workspace&quot; (i think yath refers to the in-config render by that) then you should detach it from the config window
