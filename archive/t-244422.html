<div class="posttext">Can anyone help me please.<br />
does anyone know of a skin which allows the visualisation toolbar to be detached.<br />
i use the visualisation for projecting on to a screen in a club,but i would like to be able to edit the visuals live, as i go along. i know there are keyboard shortcuts for moving to the next viz, but this often doesn't work.<br />
what i want is to have the vis playing through the projector, and the  vis editor and toolbar on my laptop screen</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the hotkeys and the editor should be enough. you can also use a midi keyboard to control the presets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i wished it were. please enlighten me.<br />
if i have got the editor open and make any changes to the vis, when press ctrl-u  it doesn't move on to the next vis.<br />
i have to close the editor then the shortcut key works.<br />
this is a problem as i don't want people to see what i am doing on the projector.<br />
maybe i am missing something, as winamp is new to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, those hotkeys don't always work when the editor is open. (Jumping ahead to the next preset when you press U would make editing difficult, you see.)<br />
<br />
You might need to use &quot;Preset -&gt; Load&quot; instead. Some of the vis-data pauses while you do that, though, so it's probably not the best solution.<br />
<br />
Also, look at the &quot;Settings -&gt; Presets/Hotkeys&quot; screen. You can use that to jump to specific presets (if you set them up beforehand) without having to use Preset -&gt; Load, and you can also turn off the save prompt too, which may also be useful in your case. (Probably worth noting that this hotkey feature actually saves a copy of the current preset into a file named after the key.)<br />
<br />
What kind of editing do you do &quot;live&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">how can you use the midi keyboard yath? just map it to keys or something more? <br />
<br />
editing presets live is a pain since they freeze whenever you tuch anything (damn i hate that about avs). you can code in some things to tweak and then use the VJ control ape. for switching presets Hotlist is the simplest and best solution imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Kev.R</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th April 2006, 17:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">This is why i thought a detachable toolbar might be the answer,(r u listening developers)i could live with the slight freezing issue.<br />
Steve most i the stuff would involve playing about with the trans/movement presets, and anything else i might like to play with as i go through them.<br />
i didn't want to save any changes to them after moving to the next one, but being able to edit them on the fly makes things more dynamic/interesting.:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">First of all:<br />
Use overlay, so the crowd won't see what youre working at.<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
Try to use a second monitor for larger and more comfortable workspace if possible.<br />
<br />
Third:<br />
Try Hotlist!<br />
It fits most of a VJ's needs in matters of flexible automized preset control and is -by now- the most advanced overhead controller for avs.<br />
<br />
-Go here: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=235788<br />
-Download Version 2.2 and upgrade to 2.3RC2<br />
-you will need to install RC1 before RC2 for it to work (more information provided in the thread)<br />
-Installer coming soon!<br />
<br />
Fourth:<br />
For Editing on the fly i would also recommend you to use the vj.ape. Messing with code during a performance is allways bad, better if you have preassigned controls which will behave the way you designed them to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i'd also recommend the use of vis_avsmod.dll as it has a bigger workspace, useful dock-in-editor mode and much faster controls than going to the menus.<br />

Oh wait, that was in offence.<br />

It still looks butt-ugly though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i recommend the use of aperesize.ape (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7800156/) over vis_avsmod.dll.<br />
it allows you to change the size of the editor dynamically.<br />
if you want a bigger &quot;workspace&quot; (i think yath refers to the in-config render by that) then you should detach it from the config window</div></div><hr />
