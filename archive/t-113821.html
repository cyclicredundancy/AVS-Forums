			<strong>Avs Files</strong><br />
		
		

		HI there!<br />
I think some of you know the avs playlister?<br />
I was thinking of adding some features to this tool wich could be very helpful:<br />
When you gounig to start a preset you should be able to change to avi / text etc before you start it.<br />
My problem is that therefore i need to know the structure of a avs file.<br />
Can anyone help?

		I ever had this idea...i'll have a look at .avs files with an hex editor to guess the structure of these files (find when avi or bmp or text is used in a preset and the possibility to change them before launching the preset)

		There may be some errors in this, but most of it should help you get started.<br />
<br />
(And yes it was reverse engineered)<br />
<br />
BTW. You need to 'Save Target As...', you'll have problems trying to view it in a web browser.

		we don't need &quot;reverse engineering&quot; coz .avs files are just datas saved by avs, have a look at an ape source file and I think we can have a good look at what avs save in these files :)

		Try opening an avs file in notepad, you can see a lot of the goings on just from that.

		You can't actually, AVS files aren't ASCII based, they're binary based. You can have a look at garbled text, but unless you have either a hex editor or a ASCII/control character viewer (like the one I wrote and used) it wont mean anything.
