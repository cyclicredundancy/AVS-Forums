		I lost you too!?! Damn!, well maybe you could look for my lost beat detection while your out there! Just kidding,the middle part was a little bit of hemp humor. Anyway,just went and moved my presets,apes,bmp files,etc,to a temp folder. Uninstalled and reinstalled Winamp, so all is well! But I'd still like to know why and what file was corrupted. Has this happened to any one else?

		Very funny :p. There was a post about something like this before, but I don't know where it is. You might want to search the forums for it.
