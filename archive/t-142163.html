      <p class="post-content">If you're using Winamp2.x, check the contents of your Winamp\Plugins\AVS folder. This is where all the presets, APEs and pictures are stored.<br />
      <br />
      For Winamp3, the folder is Winamp3\Wacs\Data\AVS.<br />
      <br />
      If there's nothing there, search your harddrive for files ending with '.avs', that might turn something up.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tried looking in the folder and it was empty, so I did a search of the hard drive and they didn't turn up. What can I do now?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Download some presets from here. Go to the components section and read the article on AVS at the bottom, that will give you links to quite a few excellent collections.</p>
