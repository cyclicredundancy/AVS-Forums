			<strong>Slow AVS when you use bitmaps / About Effectlists</strong><br />
		
		

		When creating AVS-presets I came across some things I try to understand, maybe someone here can clear things up.<br />
<br />
Ok, first, when I create a preset and then plug in a picture, the framerate drops a lot. Why is that. The pictures are not too big, 140*140 or 240*240 pixels, or is that too much?! I tried 8Bit and 24Bit-images, no difference.<br />
Something else about images is that when an image isn't in the place it is supposed to be, winamp simply crashes (under Windows 2000). Shouldn't there be a check when a preset is loaded, if the files it needs are existing? and why doesn't only the AVS crash?!<br />
<br />
Another thing are &quot;Effectlists&quot; how do you use them, do they slow down the AVS much, or can they be used to speed some plugins up. I in most cases try to avoid them. Using buffer-saves and -restores works too.<br />
<br />
Any information and discussion is appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, and in the end one of my plugins that uses a bitmap and effectlists. Put the bitmap into the &quot;\winamp\plugins\avs&quot;-directory, otherwise the plugin will crash Winamp (on my PC...). Have Fun.<br />

		i'll do what i can to answer. :)<br />
<br />
1. adding an image causes decrease of framerate and it natural -<br />
winamp has to render more points ... i don't know what u mean by &quot;a lot&quot; ... on celeron 300 with superscope spiral and fadeout<br />
adding pic divides framrate by 2 for example ...<br />
<br />
2. why does ur winamp crash when file isn't found is werid for me.<br />
on my comp file isn't just displayed - rest is running ok.<br />
but i use win98 ... maybe it's 2k problem? :)<br />
<br />
3. imho fx lists will always slow down framerate coz they require<br />
some calculations for mixing and this eats the cpu time ...<br />
<br />
what do u think?

			<strong>Umm....</strong><br />
		
		

		The problem with Winamp crashing when it doesn't find an AVS-related file is well known and common. I'm running Win98 se and it does it too. I'd like to know why rradikal's doesn't though :)

		When I use pictures in presets. the framerate drops about, say 2-3 frames first and stays like that for a while. After some time playing around with the preset the framerate drops very low (about 20 f/s for a SMALL Window and a Duron800...). This is what puzzles me, the preset then runs about 25-30% slower. Maybe it is a problem with Win2000 though...<br />
Same thing with a preset that runs for a long time and I don't work on it. It slows down after a while...<br />
<br />
I'll try to figure out when it exactly happens...<br />
