      I have downloaded tonnes (or if your metric in america, millions of kilogrammes)of AVS plugins for "winamp 3" and non of them work... when i click on AVS in the thinger i just get a window say that it can't detect MMX and asks for the "non MMX vesion of AVS" I have tried the plug in above but it refuses to install the version in winamp 3<br />
      <br />
      I do have The old version of winamp as an installation file some where but i think these plugins only work for winamp 3<br />
      <br />
      is there a way to get a non MMX version of AVS on winamp 3<br />
      <br />
      PLEEEEZE TELL ME!!!!!!<br />

      </blockquote>They work for lots of versions of winamp. However, by looking through the version info for winamp it seems that the MMX optimised AVS was introduced in 2.666, so you may need to get Winamp 2.65. The problem that you will have though is that the really old versions AVS is that you may not be able to use a lot of newer presets in it. The other thing is that if you don't have MMX then you must have a fairly old system, which is probably running at less than 200mhz (or you have some strange processor type) and you wouldn't get very good performance from AVS in Winamp 3, in fact I'd recommend sticking to Winamp 2, because Winamp 3 can put a huge strain on system resources on less powerful systems.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thanks</strong><br />
      :) thanks... I think I will just stick to Winamp 2 until i get a new hard drive<br />
      <br />
      this ones rubbish with tonnes of bad sectors<br />
      <br />
      any way they'll probably have brought out Winamp 4 by then and by all the complaints about AVS I have seen they will have probably have made a built in non MMX AVS that can take the new ones<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I've installed the non MMX AVS in Winamp 2 and it works but is extremely slow and doesn't play many of the plugins that i have cos they're designed for winamp 3<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank A Bunch Any Way!!!:D :cool: :p ;) :) :rolleyes: :up: :winamp:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually I'd assume by then everyone had MMX support in their processor. MMX has been standard since 200Mhz processors.<br />
      <br />
      If you don't have MMX, I doubt you'd be able to watch most AVS presets at an enjoyable speed anyhow, sorry.</p>
