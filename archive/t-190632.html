      <p class="post-content"><strong>variables to alter DM-gridsize, between(x,y,z)</strong><br />
      What I would like to see are two things:<br />
      Two variables for altering the gridsize in a DM (say, gridx and gridy), so you can alter the gridsize dynamic.<br />
      <br />
      An between(x,y,z) function. for obvious reasons where:<br />
      x must be between y and z to give 1 and 0 if x is no between y and z.<br />
      y and z must be able to be switched if pleased.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay I understand your first request, good idea, would be a really handy feature.<br />
      <br />
      that second one took me a long time to work out what the hell you meant but I see now. Still I dont really think its necessary, I mean would:<br />
      <br />
      between(x,y,z);<br />
      <br />
      really be much quicker and/or easier than:<br />
      <br />
      band(above(x,y),below(x,z));<br />
      <br />
      :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'm betting no, since implementing it would require essentially the same code. it'd pretty much only be a typing shortcut.<br />
      <br />
      unless by "y and z must be able to be switched if pleased" you mean something like<br />
      between(x,y,z)==if(above(y,z),band(below(x,y),above(x,z)),band(above(x,y),below(x,z)))</p>

      <p class="post-content">Being able to switch them is just adding a catch for lazy coders... which is not good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, i think the dynamic gridsize has been requested many many <b>many</b> times before.<br />
      <br />
      The second idea... i concur with PAK-9 &amp; atero on that. You rarely get to see new features on avs that can be already be done (if in a longer way, but still (like my fps variable request :p))</p>

      <p class="post-content">I meant that if y&gt;z it would make no difference with y&lt;z. Problem might be that the delta would be negative... that's all.. sorry to make it sound complex.<br />
      <br />
      Okay. opinions are clear. Let's drop this (= between(x,y,z)) into the well of oblivion now...</p>
