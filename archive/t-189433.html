<div class="posttext">Does any body know if visualizations can be burned onto a CD/DVD and played through the TV? I know it wont respond to music but I would like to have something that I can put on my TV during parties. If this can't be done..any other solutions or products?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can use AVS Grabber (http://www.acko.net/art/avs/) to capture AVS presets to AVI format.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">...but then you'd have to rip it to vcd format, and even then it would only work if your DVD player supports VCD format :hang: . Better to plug your computer into the TV if your graphics card has a TV out that way you can just output straight to the TV without all this fagging around with ripping to AVI's and burning CD's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">but i think that if you would have a TV on a party, it woudn't be so god as if you had a projector. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dunno, if you had a projector people would keep walking in the way of the projection. Plus they're damn expensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">... That's why there are semi-transparent screens so you can beam from *behind* the screen so no-one &quot;walks in the way&quot; :)<br />

But he said he uses a TV. So let him use his TV if it makes him happy.<br />
(This to bring matters back to topic, before another Tuggummi vs PAK-9 off-topic discussion appears.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're right they are expensive, but in some clubs you already have a projector. <br />
you sad that people would be walking in the way of the projeciton, that is wrong, because the projection is not on the floor, but it is on a wall higher than the people's size is, unless there are people who can reach to the ceiling of the club:blah:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What? I haven't even posted in this after my first post, even though i did check out the replies :weird: What are you on to WoTL? :igor:<br />
<br />
<br />
But since were at it...<br />
Yeah pak-9 he would have to do those things, but im guessing he already would know about that part and was only looking for the trick to save AVS stream into a movie format.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">... That's why there are semi-transparent screens so you can beam from *behind* the screen so no-one &quot;walks in the way&quot;  <br />
Yea but back-projecting displays have a notoriously acute viewing angle, so they're not really appropriate for parties where people want to be able to see it casually from all over the room.<br />
<br />
you sad that people would be walking in the way of the projeciton, that is wrong, because the projection is not on the floor, but it is on a wall higher than the people's size is<br />
errr.... we're talking about a guy having a party in his house not in a big club :weird: So it wont be higher than peoples size is :p<br />
<br />
Still, this is all fairly achademic as, as WoTL says, the guy has a TV and thats that.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, jacking up the computer like pak-9 said would be the best idea afterall, but if it's a very very wild party (with extra sugary lemonade!) then the PC is in a slight danger at it ;)<br />
<br />
But it's not like DVD players are free either...<br />
<br />
But this whole recording avs into dvd sounds ridicoulous to me, why would you want to watch something that is the same all over again when it can be generated in realtime with the music, i just don't get that :hang: <br />
I mean if you just want pretty spirals and whatnot trippy things animated, surely there is a LOT better solutions to it which allow higher resolutions and whatnot. Most of AVS presets can't even run at 400x300 decently without the latest of the cpu's :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Want to thank everyone for helping me out with this. You guys brought out some very good points and ideas. I'm not running a club but then again, I would like to have the vis. change with the music. I'll have to decide what to do but thanks to everyone for at least replying.<br />
<br />
thanks again:up:</div></div><hr />

i agree PAK-9, i didn't know that it is in a house, my mistake :confused:.</div></div><hr />
