			<strong>Timescope only of right channel</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I was trying to create a multi colour Timescope (the one you can find in this post). I created a red timescope for the right channel and a green one for the left channel, then I mixed the two timesocpes.<br />
I wanted to get a timescope that went from red to green working on the differences between the two audio channels.<br />
The only thing I get is a yellow timescope.<br />
After some experiments I found that the timescope only gets datas form the right channel.<br />
I tried on two different computers with two different soundcards.<br />
Did anyone else have the same problem?

		I havent checked yet your preset. but try to use blue and yellow timescopes to get the green color, and another red timescope.<br />
and change the way they are blended. &quot;additive, replace, 50/50 blend&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope, I can help....

			<strong>Still have problems</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I tried to follow your suggestion but it didn't help.<br />
Just try the simplified AVS I'm attaching with the sample MP3 that there is with it.<br />
When sound is only on right channel the AVS shows nothing, when on both it shows a yellow timescope, when only on left still a yellow timescope.<br />
The AVS was supposed to show green when only on right yellow when on both e red when on left.<br />
<br />
I also tried with just one timecope for only the right channel but it always follows keft channel.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know how to fix this?

			<strong>Really nobody intrested in this problem?</strong><br />
		
		

		I can't belive that nobody had my problem before and that no-one cares about...<br />
Nobody really needs timescope working correctly both with left and right channel?<br />
Am I the only one intrested or am I the only one that has this problem?

		I suppose you could always make your own timescope from a superscope.<br />
Just make a line that moves across, then use getspec to define red green and blue for each point. And let n=height.

			<strong>Thanks but...</strong><br />
		
		

		Thanks you for tip.<br />
But I have 2 problems with that solution<br />
1) In AVS I'm less than a newbie so I don't even know how to do a moving white vertical line, so i cant really find a way to do my own timescope.<br />
2) Even if I find out how to do that, the problem I found still is there: the default timescope uses only the left channel sound even if you select the option &quot;right channel&quot; or &quot;center channel&quot;.

		Here's one I whipped up quickly, nothing to make it pretty. It leans towards red if the left channel is louder, and green if the right is. Most of the time it's yellow.<br />

			<strong>Colors on a PC screen</strong><br />

In case you didn't know, colours on a pc-screen don't work the same way as with paint. They are inverted. On a screen, color is blended additively from the 3 basic colours: red, green and blue. Slam your head against your monitor and see the three channels there if you have a good eye.<br />
<br />
The whole mix-up is that most people believe the 3 main colours are red, yellow and blue. Nuh-uh. The inverted main colours are magenta (purple), cyan (skyblue) and yellow. These are the exact negatives of the primary colours. The reason paint blends like that, is because more paint means more light-absorption and more blackness.<br />
<br />
In your case, blue (RGB: 0, 0, 255) and yellow (RGB: 255, 255, 0) would result in either white (additive) or gray (50/50).

Thanks, that's what I needed.<br />
I just flipped the Y axis and I got the timescope I wanted.<br />
I also added blu on central channel.<br />
I will look the superscope code to understand how you did it.<br />
<br />
I still wonder why the default timescope works only on the left channel but actually it's just for curiosity.<br />
<br />
Thank you also because now I have basses on the lower part of the window, when I tried to get that on the default Timescope it slowed down, while with your superscope framerate remains the same.

		UnConeD <br />
 If you are a PRO, ok I respect !! but take it easy, watch your language !!!<br />
And, the comment I made, its not 100% wrong, if I mix colors, I get another color.
