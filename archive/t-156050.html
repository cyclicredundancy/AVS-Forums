<div class="posttext">Hi! People! I'm just a Winamp User that fools around with AVS on his free time. <br />
    I was listening to the Pink Floyd Album and decided to make some presets for each song and, well, here they are!<br />
Some are not as good as the others (if they are any good at all!),but I specially like &quot;Any Color you Like&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot;.<br />
<br />
    Anyway I'm sure that if you are a Floyd fan, you'll be interested (even if you want to slaughter me after you try them ;-) and if you don't know what The Dark Side of the Moon is, die! (just kidding, you can just break a leg or something)<br />
<br />
They are all in the zip file. Enjoy!!<br />

<div class="posttext">well, frankly i think i'd have to be on about the same amount of crack as o floyd was when he made that album to watch these presets, and then they wouldn't be yours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero: I'm sorry,I think I don't understand you (I'm not being sarcastic or anything, it's just that English is not my mother tongue and I trend to get lost whenin gets too coloquial). But, did you just accuse me ofposting presets that aren't mine as if they were?<br />
<br />
I repeat, probably I misunderstood.<br />
Anyhow, take care!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think he was referring to the fact that you forgot to attach the presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey, are you that joaquin jardim guy?  i remember you....yeah, alright then. <br />
<br />
that's a neat idea for a AVS pack, i've thought about doing something like that before.  it's actually one of my favorite albums, but the presets need some workage.  <br />
<br />
although &quot;any colour you like&quot; was pretty cool, with the prism and stuff. :up: <br />
<br />
btw - pink floyd rules :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well... I'm glad you liked that one. I know they are really 'standard' but well,I'm new at this and you've got to start somewhere!!<br />
<br />
I'm not that Joaquin Jardim guy, sorry to disapoint you.<br />
And yes, Pink Floyd definitelly RULES!</div></div><hr />
