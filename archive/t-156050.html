      <p class="post-content"><strong>The Dark Side of The Moon</strong><br />
      Hi! People! I'm just a Winamp User that fools around with AVS on his free time.<br />
      I was listening to the Pink Floyd Album and decided to make some presets for each song and, well, here they are!<br />
      Some are not as good as the others (if they are any good at all!),but I specially like "Any Color you Like" and "Brain Damage".<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I'm sure that if you are a Floyd fan, you'll be interested (even if you want to slaughter me after you try them ;-) and if you don't know what The Dark Side of the Moon is, die! (just kidding, you can just break a leg or something)<br />
      <br />
      They are all in the zip file. Enjoy!!<br />

      <p class="post-content">well, frankly i think i'd have to be on about the same amount of crack as o floyd was when he made that album to watch these presets, and then they wouldn't be yours.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero: I'm sorry,I think I don't understand you (I'm not being sarcastic or anything, it's just that English is not my mother tongue and I trend to get lost whenin gets too coloquial). But, did you just accuse me ofposting presets that aren't mine as if they were?<br />
      <br />
      I repeat, probably I misunderstood.<br />
      Anyhow, take care!</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, are you that joaquin jardim guy? i remember you....yeah, alright then.<br />
      <br />
      that's a neat idea for a AVS pack, i've thought about doing something like that before. it's actually one of my favorite albums, but the presets need some workage.<br />
      <br />
      although "any colour you like" was pretty cool, with the prism and stuff. :up:<br />
      <br />
      btw - pink floyd rules :)</p>
