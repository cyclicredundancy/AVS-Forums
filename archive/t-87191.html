      <p class="post-content"><strong>fresh</strong><br />
      My personal favorite out of the bunch is Gyro. I think part of the reason I like it so much is that it's just so "fresh." I can't quite describe why it seems so fresh; maybe it's just that it's something that isn't insanely complicated, it's free from visual clutter (clutter isn't always bad-but no clutter is good for a change), and it's refreshingly different.<br />
      <br />
      Gyro is perfect as it is. The following is just a suggestion as to how to give it a "foggy" layer around it. Try adding a movement such as medium swirl, big shift out, etc. (or even design your own movement).<br />
      <br />
      What I'd like to know is how you came up with such a refreshingly down-to-earth preset?!? :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nice shapes in gyro and mirror. I think gyro needs to respond to the music though. It just spins the same no matter what's going on.<br />
      <br />
      As for tiedie, I never liked the movement (or scatter) + water effect. It's pretty simple, kinda remins me of one in my pack. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Please feel free to make changes for beat detection and put them up here. As far as gyro i just look for something that catches my eye can't exactly describe it just see it.</p>
