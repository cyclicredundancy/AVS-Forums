<div class="posttext">My personal favorite out of the bunch is Gyro.  I think part of the reason I like it so much is that it's just so &quot;fresh.&quot;  I can't quite describe why it seems so fresh; maybe it's just that it's something that isn't insanely complicated, it's free from visual clutter (clutter isn't always bad-but no clutter is good for a change), and it's refreshingly different.<br />
<br />
Gyro is perfect as it is.  The following is just a suggestion as to how to give it a &quot;foggy&quot; layer around it.  Try adding a movement such as medium swirl, big shift out, etc. (or even design your own movement).<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is how you came up with such a refreshingly down-to-earth preset?!?  :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Nice shapes in gyro and mirror. I think gyro needs to respond to the music though. It just spins the same no matter what's going on.<br />
<br />
As for tiedie, I never liked the movement (or scatter) + water effect. It's pretty simple, kinda remins me of one in my pack. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Please feel free to make changes for beat detection and put them up here. As far as gyro i just look for something that catches my eye can't exactly describe it just see it.</div></div><hr />
