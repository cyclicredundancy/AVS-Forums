		I was messing around with one of my older ideas and eventually it evolved into this bizarre morphing 3d object. I have this niggling feeling that I'm the only one who likes these sorts of superscopes since noone else seems to make them, so I'd like to know if you like it or not.

		Sweet, but I wouldn't make the outline that thick, or that sharp.  The movement could use bilinear filtering, too.

		That's pretty nice man. I like the background without biliniear filterng on.<br />
<br />
Just so happens I'm working on a semi-old scope too. You're not the only one. :p

		Yeah, the first on is more impressive, but that one is nice.<br />
<br />
bwt, That wasn't the finished one rattaplan. It's still in progress. I looks emptier as just white dots. I tried to dress it up a bit.

		The reason that the second one is a bit shashy is because theres only so much you can do at high res before you framerate plummets to practically zero, plus it only looks good at high res, preferably fullscreen. Hopefully if you have a fast computer you could run that one in 1280x1024 or even higher.
