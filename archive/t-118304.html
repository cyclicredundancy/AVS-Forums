<div class="posttext">Here is a preview to my first pack, this should giva person an idea as to my style. Still in development tho I must say. I take my time cause I'm a busy boy and I 'm still studying AVS. <br />
<br />
Be warned it contains two swear words and is therefore rated (M 15+)<br />
dont download unless you are 15 or over.<br />
<br />
Please give me any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, Especially that of the artistic side cause I'm aware of my own level of coding. So dont dis my coding, But help is appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Okay, here we go:<br />
<br />
Sweet: not bad as a mellow preset.<br />
<br />
60s man: Not sure what you're trying for here. you can leave out the superscope in the first effect list, cause you can't see it with that movement.<br />
<br />
AmixedEyeOSauron: Looks good, but I can't remeber what the originals looked like.<br />
<br />
Confliction: kept crashing my system. :(<br />
<br />
Electronic eye 2: I just found this one boring. Maybe as a background, but not as a preset.<br />
<br />
Eleventhe Dimensional Apple: It's the text that makes this one. It's kinda boring too, but the text...<br />
<br />
Fish Bowl: The was my favourite. :) I dunno if it really needs better fishes.<br />
<br />
In the Depths of Mordor: I wouldn't release this one. It still looks like it's in development. If you wan't you can make the ring round by using something like x=x*h/w<br />
<br />
We like to party like electrons: This preset really needs something. I'm not a huge fan of minimalist presets.<br />
<br />
Overall: don't let this one go out just yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeh cheers,<br />
<br />
pitty about the confliction preset thats my favourite. I think it might be something I did with the colour values of part of the lines I kinda just type coded in some values, mabey something in there is freakin it out.... ??. Yeh I agree, so far I'm just putting something up as a sample I really appreciate the feed back tho. I've seen some of your presets and I like'm so I rezpec-t that.  Dozent need new fishies ??? the orange dot does have a kinda fin thing happening doen't it.</div></div><hr />
