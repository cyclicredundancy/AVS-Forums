<div class="posttext">I have just finished a slightly updated version of Image2GVM (1.1) and a beta version of a new tool, Model2GVM. They are both dependent on the Microsoft .net framework.<br />
<br />
http://jheriko.kicks-ass.net/avs_projects/GVMTools_0_5_beta_1.exe<br />
(130k, slightly too large to attach)<br />
<br />
Model2GVM allows loading of .obj and .3ds model files with correct normals, diffuse, ambient and specular materials to be exported to .gvm in a few different formats.<br />
<br />
It provides a preview pane (with slightly dodgy mouse control... I will fix this) which renders the model using triangle.ape with zbuf and back face culling.<br />
<br />
It is a little unstable, but the bugs I know about will produce a small message box with a &quot;Fatal error:...&quot; message. For any other crashes I haven't encountered yet please paste all details here so I can try to decipher it and fix the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several features I intend to add before version 1.0<br />
<br />
(*)'Fraction' compression on materials, using the same technique as Image2GVM<br />
(*)Output of indexed vertex, normal and material lists from which the triangles are defined (this produces MUCH smaller files and is generally efficient)<br />
(*)Complete help<br />
(*)Outputting simple subdivision code with .GVM<br />
(*)obj4avs.exe compatible options<br />
(*)Simple Render / Triangle code output<br />
(*)Improved renderer (the current one doesn't do anything with specular or ambient components)<br />
(*)Removal of (virtually) all bugs<br />
<br />
Some features I might implement in a post 1.0 version:<br />
(*)MD2 and MD3 model support (no materials)<br />
(*)Evallib code window to allow custom renderer (similar to Render / Triangle APE)<br />
(*)Generating triangle material from texture map<br />
(*)In editor triangle subdivision/merging<br />
(*)Precomputed lighting/shadowing options<br />
<br />
If there are any features which you would find useful, please let me know. Also if there are any other model formats which you would like supported, let me know and I will look into it... no promises tho, most formats are hell to work out.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />

Should be faster than my crappy http server..<br />
<br />
Now includes some sample presets</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've installed this program to my computer.. (include with the updates from another thread of yours too).<br />
<br />
But, some kind an idiot error kept popping out when I'm trying to open it (Error Starting Program). It said; &quot;A required .DLL file, MSCOREE.DLL, was not found.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, am I missed some of your updates?</div></div><hr />

 They are both dependent on the Microsoft .net framework. <br />

<br />
Update your windows with this. Future other software will require this framework too... M$ is pushing it as their next target platform. I am working on getting it to work without .net without having to port the code to c++ but its a while off yet... sorry bout that. <br />
<br />
.net helps me make stuff a lot lot faster</div></div><hr />
