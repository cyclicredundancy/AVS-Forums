<br />
this is a compilation pack...<br />
<br />
Private Compilation 2006 (http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/PrivateCompilation2006.exe) <br />
<br />
I moved this here from the other thread and I may be deleting the other thread..<br />
<br />
Working on a little installer issue.. but I have both the .exe and the .rar file for everyone..<br />
<br />
Private Compilation 2006 RAR File (http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/PrivateCompilation2006.rar)<br />
<br />
Okay so please give credit where its due.. This pack includes over 312 Avs Presets..<br />
<br />
I adjusted mine for performance going fullscreen .. and the pack ran for 48 hours on two systems..<br />
<br />
I can get the settings for anyone who needs them.. I think I have it all in a notepad document somewhere.. <br />
<br />
HP 360N ( 2000 Model )<br />
1.6 GHz with 512 Ram<br />
1280 x 1024 16 bit 80%<br />
<br />
Everex ( the Most efficient Laptop in the world :weird: 2006 Model )<br />
1.7 Ghz with 480<br />
1280 x 768 32 bit<br />
Using Winamp Modern Skin<br />
<br />
I had to eliminate some of the visualizations as they quit working properly after the upgrade to 5.32..<br />
But this pack was taken from all of the highlights of the Avs's as I could find. my critiquing may need to be fine tuned to your liking but over all I found it to diverse and include atleast one thing from just about everyone..</div></div><hr />

If I were you I would try wildly experimenting and web tutorials. JavaScript is extremely straightforward if you have any other programming experience.. (e.g. AVS Preset)<br />
<br />
Also PHP and SQL fall into the same box of &quot;trivial&quot; languages. As an example I have always been able to learn enough of any of these three in an hour or two to be able to do whatever I wanted to do. I constantly &quot;re-forget&quot; them too.<br />
<br />
There are tons of resources on the internet, one of the best for web junk like this is http://www.w3schools.com.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you are wondering why noone is commenting on your pack it might be because none of those links work...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This also might be because I have removed them from my Apache Server and I am having this account deleted...after the PM I received today</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The link is back as of 2 hours from the last post I did...<br />
<br />
There usually isn't much feedback...Except the one above ..<br />
<br />
The pack will be updated again tonight--tomorrow..it  will include other avs files as well..<br />
<br />
The all links site wide will be updated when this link is updated..therefore any all will still be current and correct..<br />
<br />
I also have to update the installer to version 3 beta 6 for this pack it works fine like it is now but keeping up with the progresses made with the PIMPBOT installer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">heath28m</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th January 2007, 10:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Its updated..its good.. Tested on a fresh install of the default WinAMP 5.32 no extras..<br />
<br />
Only one visual out of the now 329, did not do well, until it went fullscreen ... then it was fine ...<br />
<br />
No changes to the AVS settings were performed in testing..<br />
<br />
Private Compilation 2006 (http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/PrivateCompilation2006.exe) <br />
<br />
<br />
The Url for the .rar which includes them all is currently offline<br />
<br />
and I don't care if I am talking to myself here ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and thanks for all of the response I actually did get looking over the server logs..:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well.. its not what I expected (I thought it was some huge-ass pack of your presets) but its a fairly neat idea, bringing together a lot of presets from different authors.<br />
<br />
The only critisism I have is that the presets aren't sorted by artist quite properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">heath28m</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th January 2007, 23:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah I know..<br />
<br />
and it actually lacks audio/visual staging presentation too..<br />
<br />
The big deal was the names and so on.. after I had went through like 2000 presets packs..and sorted and so on . I moved them to one folder because I thought it woudl make the randomization better.. and would keep the the avs's from doubling back on themselves after so far..<br />
<br />
Then I realized that some mimicked one another ( the same presets with a slightly different filename ) so I tried to erase duplicates..<br />
<br />
During that I realized that quite a few of these presets were actually not fully named because of staging within a pack and so on... <br />
<br />
The task of downloading and researching the all of the authors... and renaming them to all be categorized by their author name seemed like a little too much ...LOL<br />
<br />
So I left them how I got them basically..just all in one folder...</div></div><hr />
