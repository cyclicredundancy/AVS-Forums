      Not to say i don't believe you, but it does sound kinda fishy that it happened <b>*just*</b> before you were going to release it ;)<br />

      I lost my two best presets evah in a HD crash. One of which I went to upload on DA the day before, an my 56k connection disconnected itself for some reason. And then I realized I had to go somewhere, and left it for the next day. The next day I was playing something, and waiting for 19:00 (net's cheaper after that)..... and the disc died suddenly. It took a long time (a couple of months) for me to replace it, I lost all the will I had to AVS, and retired.<br />
      <br />
      How did it get toasted ? Sure it's not something trivial like the cable falling off ?</p>

      </blockquote>Alright so I had 2 hard disks, one of 60Gb and one of 15gb (on this one I only had music). One day I powered my comp and then the first thing I see on the screen is "Major failure Hard disk number 2".<br />
      <br />
      After you see that they ask you what do you want to do: restart or continue so I tried continue and it never got out of the Windows loading screen.<br />
      <br />
      Then I installed windows on the other hard disk and now it works but I still can't access the other 60gb.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hmm</strong><br />
      i have a question for you florin. what was your computer acting like before the crash cause mainly crashes are caused 70% of the time when you forget to defrag and perform a full systems check. but 10% it was a file that was infected with a virus. 20% it was something you did that caused the crash oh i don't know, maybe you repartitioned your hardrive or you reformated it. heh. sorry man but the whole my hd crashed before i could release my pack excuse is a little lame even for you. i work with comp0uters all my life and i know exactly how they tick. and i want to know what is your spec for your home made comp i'm drooling to know :D heheheh but no matter i'm sure whatever you can whip up will look nice for visualnoobs anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So now you're saying that this is my excuse for not having a pack? Well if it's that you're wrong and trust me I wouldn't really care when I'm realeasing my pack, it's not like I have a dead line.<br />
      <br />
      I think it was the 70% you were talking about though and yea I think I should've been more carefull. Now I learned my lessson.</p>

      <p class="post-content">for future reference, there is software on sourceforge that monitors SMART status of your harddrives and can give a clue to impending failure<br />
      <br />
      there is always the freezer trick (dry ice works lots better) and norton unerase as well<br />
      <br />
      also, there are a lot of retail vendors selling factory seconds knowingly as first-quality goods, which typically fail in a year or two<br />
      <br />
      lastly, the industry as a whole is moving toward reduced MTFB and concommittant warranty periods, in order to increase profit margins; this said, there are a few mfgrs that are still making available storage products with 5 year warranties, but they are dwindling fast....<br />
      <br />
      moral: do your homework before purchasing a replacement, and BACKUP as though your life depended on it<br />
