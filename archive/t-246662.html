<div class="posttext">you have driven me off this board...<br />
FOR GOOD!<br />
I am tired of the constant belittling/ignorant/useless comments i receive here for my presets.<br />
if it's &quot;too flashy&quot; : STOP FUCKING USING IT IN THE DARK<br />
if you think it's &quot;noobish&quot; then you can go straight to the seventh hell of buddah, for not realising it is very hard to make decent looking presets without programming (which i might add is something i will NEVER learn) (at least not for something that i get such little out of)this is something i do of my own blood sweat and tears, and you people have robbed me of any joy, posting them could ever give me.<br />
<br />
so in  conclusion if you've posted in any of my avs threads : GO FUCK YOURSELF <br />
the rest of the forums users however, were mostly polite friendly and even people i wouldn't mind knowing in most cases.<br />
<br />
lastly i'd like to thank everyone who posted about my presets...<br />
FOR RUINING SOMETHING THAT WAS ONCE FUN</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I never did got any of your threads, Too-DAMN-Much, but now I did a forum search and I found some of your presents.<br />
<br />
You have very constructive ideas and you shouldn't had stoped doing it just beacause some people are way to critic.<br />
<br />
My personal favorite was &quot;Spiral into nothing&quot;. You should keep on doing avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Suggestion man.<br />
stop what you are doing and lay it to rest about the presets. if you start out making enemies here, then your better off dead. trust me after my issue on the challenge post i thought everyone hated me. maybe some of you still do. but hey just let it be. the more you react the more you lose. your presets are very good. i'm noob to man and let me i was impressed at you attempt. i'm not saying this to cheer you up. but for god sakes stop before its too late. i would hate to see you get banned for such a ridiculous issue. so what they gave a bad impression on your pack. but thats life and thats the rating system here. next time don't take it so literraly. ok just chill. sheesh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Don't take it so personally... every noob gets the same sort of treatment, and tbh its your own fault for expecting an unrealistically good review in the first place. :P<br />
<br />
Noob presets are like a child's crayon drawings in a lot of ways...<br />
<br />
1.) The child/noob takes it much too personally if you say they suck<br />
2.) They are usually simple, easily recreateable and unattractive<br />
3.) Nobody wants to see them on display in the Louvre / with 5 stars at the Winamp.com downloadable AVS section<br />
<br />
Srsly, just deal with it... but sorry anyway if I contributed to the comments that drove you off... I can be pretty harsh on noobs at times. :/</div></div><hr />

heh like you were with me. but i forgiven you on that. anyway its as jheriko says. if you post it on the forums expect something you don't like to happen and don't take it extremely seriously. like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok let me clarify why i made this here. <br />
i wanted to make presets without any coding that people thought were at least passable, secondly i wanted very much for them to change quite a bit when a beat hits, unlike a lot of the other presets i saw out there.<br />
now, i made this thread because noone seems to care/understand WHAT I WANTED TO DO with avs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you see, we really don't want to have epileptic seizures when viewing AVS so we strive away from stuff like this. If you still continue to practice this kind of AVSing i recommend you put a disclaimer/warning on your packs, something like: &quot;Warning, watching these presets may cause epilectic seizures, especially if you have epilepsy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hope you take these advices to your heart and co-operate, thank you, have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What pak, not so subtly means, is that all the possibilites that the built-in effects offer have been so thoroughly explored throughout the history of AVS that nothing made with them really surprises &quot;us&quot; (veterans as pak-9 put it). Also why people prefer to code and look at coded stuff is because coding gives you practically total control of what the effect is doing, ie. a superscope or dynamic movement. Even little ammounts of code can broaden your possibilities in AVS so much.<br />
<br />
Of course what you do and like to watch is your business, but im afraid you'll get a &quot;hostile&quot; review everytime here for using basic effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th June 2006, 14:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">..in addition to what Tugg says, people who are really adamant that they dont want to code typically end up throwing millions of components into a preset to try and make it look original. The result of which is usually a very slow, busy preset. People are generally pretty forgiving of frame rate if its a technical extravaganza, but not when its just a load of effects thrown together<br />
<br />
(although I should probably qualify that statement by noting that some people like frames of reality do pull it off)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about writing codes or not, it's because, some of you guys have seen too much presets throghout the years and every time you see a preset(even a really nice one), you feel that you have seen atleast 2 or 3 a little bit nicer simillar presets and it affects your reviews.<br />
<br />
I think, if it was not possible to edit released presets then most of the times you wouldn't able to determine whether the creator has used the coding stuff(sc,dm,...) or this is just a mixture of basic render/trans effects, it's just too much possibilites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th June 2006, 15:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">To be honest i haven't really even seen that many presets, but after a while (say 6 years like me) you just know where the basic effects lead to and you can predict the result every single time once you get the knack of how things work in AVS. With coded components there's always the element of surprise present and that's what makes those presets that much better than the ones that use only built-in effects.<br />
<br />
Built-in effects are just boring and predictable even though there is still a unlimited ammount of variations you can do.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, its usually quite easy to guess the constituent parts of a preset.</div></div><hr />
