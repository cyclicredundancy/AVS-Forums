Plan:<br />
June 2 2003 @ 10:03pm<br />
For me, coding is a form of self-expression. <br />
<br />
It's probably the form I'm most effective at.<br />
<br />
Everything I code is arguably owned by the company. <br />
<br />
The company controls what I do with my code [in the past, it seemed I had <br />
freedom, but it turns out all of that was not really the case--rather, I <br />
was somehow avoiding the control illicitly (for 4 years)]<br />
<br />
The company controls the most effective means of self-expression I have. <br />
<br />
This is unacceptable to me as an individual, therefore I must leav.<br />
<br />
I don't know when it will be, but I'm not going to last much longer.<br />
<br />
I have nothing but respect for the company--I've just come to realize that<br />
it is time to do something different.</div></div><hr />

on the other hand, us avser who were eagerly awaiting the next release are left stranded. <br />
<br />
Gotta hand it to the guy for all thi shit he has put up with from us. :D<br />
<br />
We pray that the remaining nullsoft team will think about a replacement avs guru.<br />

I cant see them just forgetting about the whole thing</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That would be cool, at this stage, any avs replacement would be cool :D (but not milkdrop :blah: ) It should work just like avs though... otherwise i would probably stick to avs or quit it all together.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:eek: wow didn't know that he was leaving. Maybe time to move on for him. No doubt all to do with the WASTE problems.<br />
<br />
ON a positivee note and visualization in general I am working on a new visualation with GOrdon WIllaims R2, R2/e etc. Meet up with him yesterday and shared ideas and looked at his new r4 alpha ver nice stuff will be made when it is completed.<br />
And we plan to make it customisable as possible. I know it is not AVS but I am sharing the info as we all know that the nullsoft visualizations are not being produce any more. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2003, 15:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">sounds good.. I havnt seen anything of R2 for a while.<br />
Just how customisable is &quot;customisable as possible&quot;? <br />
Not AVS customisable i assume.<br />
(custom script?? :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
tugg. if he does make an AVS replacement, i dont think it could be very avs like:<br />
Everything I code is arguably owned by the company<br />
<br />
im quite shook up about the whole thing :(:cry:<br />
<br />
we sure do have lives here..were all distraught because the coder of our fav computer program has retired :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2003, 15:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The customisable thing is still under discusssion but we both agree to really make it grow we want to let everyone else be able to do stuff.<br />
<br />
True it may not be as much as AVS (what is though?:))but probably realistically somewhere between MilkDrop/G-force customisable to AVS.<br />
<br />
Early days yet but we will see.</div></div><hr />

btw<br />
n general I am working on a new visualation with GOrdon WIllaims R2, R2/e etc. Meet up with him yesterday and shared ideas and looked at his new r4 alpha ver nice stuff will be made when it is completed. <br />
I've been experimenting with a modular OpenGL visualiser Ã  la AVS as well. I don't have time to develop it now (exams), and so far I've only got a framework.<br />
<br />
Not sure if my approach will lead to anyting, because this is the first serious OpenGL app I've done, and such projects tend to need a rewrite halfway through, but we'll see ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is EXACTLY what I was thinking when I read this.  if justin's leaving the company he can move on to better things independently.  hopefully he can still use his original source code - imo quitting a company and having them steal all of your hard work would be a personal hell :hang:<br />

<br />
Well....it's not really stealing, is it?  I mean, AOL did pay $80 some million for it -- assuming they paid him in cash, not AOL stock, I'd imagine Justin's doing OK.  I realize, though, that you were commenting more about the attachment programmers have to the code they write, and I do understand that, but the reality is most likely that he can't legally use that code in other projects after he leaves nullsoft.  <br />

<br />
Yes, anything done in his spare time should be (and would be) his.  Anything he did for AOL (as well as anything nullsoft did pre-aol that was covered by the buyout), however, would probably be off limits.  Things he did in his &quot;spare time&quot; for winamp, may fall into a gray area though, since if AOL wanted to be mean, I'm sure their lawyers could come up with a way to claim ownership of it.  Of course, this is all speculation -- once Justin leaves AOL, he may decide to start on some totally new, amazing project to change our lives.  :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Unfortunately AVS is still (c) Nullsoft and was developed on Nullsoft hours I believe (if you look at the people who made it, they're all Nullsofters).<br />
<br />
It's not a good sign though. Justin was the driving force behind the firsts Winamps afaik (and probably most of the other projects). If he wants to leave his brainchild, then it means something is definitely wrong. Fragmentation is never a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Fragmentation is never a good thing. <br />
<br />
neither is censorship. a positive word for fragmentation is variety.<br />
<br />
let's assume justin creates a competing software to winamp. this not only leads to a good alternative, it also puts nullsoft in the posittion to react on the competion. in the end it's the user that benefits. i wish justin a long life, so he can fulfill all of his software-dreams :D<br />
<br />
anyway, it seems like justin is flirting with open-source models lately. so any of his project could have wide support from the community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killahbite: well put.. no matter what he does now, he will have a huge following from any self-respecting winamper/avser/shoutcaster etc. At the very least, we can be garrenteed that his future coding wont simply slip out of all knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Been back for a while now, got all the work stuff sorted out. I'm at<br />
