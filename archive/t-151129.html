      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS plugin APE is where?</strong><br />
      I can't find the APE. Yes, I know it's somewhere blindingly obvious. I can't find it, anyway.<br />
      <br />
      The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/nsdn/wvs/dev/apes.jhtml" target="_blank">link</a> in the FAQ caliming to be to the APE page in fact links to a demo of the APE. Does this demo in fact come with the APE?<br />
      <br />
      <font size="1">Side note: Shouldn't 'http://ftp.winamp.com/' be 'ftp://ftp.winamp.com/'?</font><br />
      <br />
      Anyway, even if it is, that APE is in C++, and I was hoping to find something in straight C. Is there such a thing?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I might as well give you my other question just now, even if it isn't useful to me yet:<br />
      <br />
      Does the APE have something for interpreting scripts that render/superscopes, trans/movements, etc have?<br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Damn. Get your mind sorted out, Irrel. I meant SDK.<br />
      <br />
      Oups.<br />

      <br />
      Anyway, thanks. Does that SDK cover WA3 as well?<br />
      <br />
      If not, should I just get &amp; write for WA2 because of the impendingness (how very unwordly :rolleyes: ) of WA5?<br />

      <p class="post-content">The demo of the SDK is the SDK. Just modify/recompile. There is an extended API for AVS2.7pre which allows you to use the scripting library, but that is still subject to change so I wouldn't recommend using it yet (look around the forums for that).</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK.<br />
      <br />
      I think before I got confused between APE and API (which is kinda like SDK).<br />
