<div class="posttext">In one of the earliest release of the AVS Plugin and its presets there was a real neat preset that I loved. I couldn't find it in the current presets and I am not able to create it. The vis preset was similar to the ones that you can see at concerts or rave parties with smoke and green lasers moving in the smoke. Does anybody of a similar preset or can anybody make one. <br />
<br />
I have attached a picture of laser and smoke effect.<br />

<div class="posttext">There are many presets like that. Do you have any idea about the name of the preset or who made it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It was a long time back... (around early 2000 ;)) Don't remember the name or the author.<br />
<br />
I was hoping somebody could give a name of a preset thats in the current WA5 package or maybe or somebody has such a preset available online.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you are sure it came with the winamp install, then you can find any old winamp version at:  http://www.winampheaven.net/<br />
<br />
If it didn't came within the install then there is zero we can do to help, unless someone wants to make a totally new preset (which isn't that hard actually, but who has time...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i once uploaded all presets from winamp 2 and winamp 3 to this forum. however, it appears that posts older than 2 or 3 months get purged. maybe someone still has them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Does anybody remember the first WinAmp2 version that came with AVS and a pretty big set of presets. I will be a good starting point for me to get going and search for the preset i am looking for.<br />
<br />
I went throught every single Preset thats in WA5 and couldn't find one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tuggummi, thanks for the tip man. I went thru the list of previous versions and found one with the description &quot;Winamp Advanced Visualization Studio 2.0&quot;... sweet. :D<br />
<br />
I got Winamp 2.61 and lo and behold, the preset i was looking was there. Justin-Laser Light. I have attached it if anybody else is interested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oops... <br />
<br />
Attaching it again. This is slightly modified from the original. I just changed the colors and some of the parameters in Trans-Movement.</div></div><hr />
