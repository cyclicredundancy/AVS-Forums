<div class="posttext">First things first... I am an avid AVS user who has tried and (for now) failed to learn how to make AVS's.  However, when &quot;DeskMod ONE&quot; came out I had hoped for another one to soon follow.  Due to the recent slow-down (although not much) in AVS preset making, I decided that now would be a good time to try and make a contribution to the AVS community by releasing what will most likely be several packs of some of the best AVS visualizations ever made (with the author's permission of course).<br />
<br />
This is where I could use everyone's help.  Although I currently have... um... *click* *click* &lt;muttering under breath&gt; damn! &lt;/muttering under breath&gt; over 1000 presets, and I can't possibly find all of the best ones.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate it if anyone would let me know what some of their favorite presets are.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Damn... I just realized that this thread should be in the upper level... but it won't let me delete and repost... any mods willing to help me out here?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, but this just sounds like you're trying to get famous with other people's hard work.<br />
<br />
I DO NOT GRANT YOU PERMISSION TO USE MY PRESETS</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, it's nothing like that.  It's not like I want the credit or anything (actually, I'd prefer I didn't get any credit).  It's just that I've found that if you want great presets you usually have to download many packs.  I just want to help bring together the best of the best...<br />

<div class="posttext">Ok, but still i think the only one i would approve to make that kind of a collection should be someone &quot;official&quot; like the nullsoft staff or something... Then there wouldn't be any misunderstandments.</div></div><hr />

Oh.  Well in that case... who should I (and/or anyone else) kidnap? ;)<br />
<br />
But seriously though, who would I mention this to?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh well... I'll continue this is the morning.  Too tired right now.  Well, that and the fact that the cat is attacking my foot :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It aint such a bad idea,but it would be better if someone from the Nullsoft staff would take care of it,like Tuggi said :D Oh and use the EDIT button :) (i like to say that)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">last time nullsoft did a large compilation it had ONLY shit presets in it. (at least i think it was a nullsoft one).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hmmm... after some more thinking, I think it would be better to make this a forum project.  How about having anyone submit 1-3 of their best presets, compile them all together, and give them to the Nullsoft guys to replace (or as another set of presets) &quot;newpicks&quot; (not in the same directory of course...)?  Besides, who better to decide the best of someone's presets than the person who made them?<br />
<br />
Might also be a good idea to have a majority vote to remove any presets that aren't very good (noob filtering ;) )<br />
<br />
May need to work out the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th May 2003, 03:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah people submit their best presets and the crap ones are filtered out and ony the best are left in. The problem is when people make new presets they'll want to change their submission and it will cause hassle, and lots of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Wiser87</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th May 2003, 04:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well... considering that there aren't a lot of people who make really good presets, maybe something like 5 per person.<br />
<br />
Besides, if it's something that might replace 'newpicks,' then the effort is definately worth it!<br />
<br />
I might also be able to host a .zip file on my website that could contain the current set of presets.  Might help to take some of the &quot;wasted space&quot; that sometimes happens in threads like this.  (Although considering what's happened with this thread so far, it might be better to let someone with more 'authority' make a new thread to have a fresh start)</div></div><hr />

<br />
use what the french call: &quot;a deadline&quot;.<br />
only they say it in french of coarse.<br />
<br />
yeah.. five each, that dont mean that five will make into the pack for ANYONE, just a wider range for choice. Also, this way means that the artist gets to pick his submissions, instead of the 'old-classics&quot; (shit) presets making it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Could we just try to work things out here and then get a mod to make a new thread/sticky?  Just about anything would be better than the newpicks (and don't try to prove me wrong or I'll sic my cat on you :igor: ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th May 2003, 09:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">First, you should ask nullsoft about the next release of winamp so that we should know how much time there is.Second,this thread doesnt deserve to be a sticky cause its a complete mess and we dont need a new sticky,there are enough already.And we can make newpicks also from the contest started in the main thread.Participate wiser,it wont hurt you :D</div></div><hr />
