<div class="posttext">Due to a major HD, motherboard and processor crash I will need some time to re-install my entire system. You may have noticed my absence here lately (or maybe not ;) ) You know I don't want to see my fans waiting, so I will be back here as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks for understanding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, my power supply blew up 2 months ago, taking out the motherboard, processor, 2 hardrives, cd-rw, DVD, and my Radeon 9700 Pro. (Futureshop's no hassle retun policy is great)<br />

Look at it as an opportunity to upgrade.</div></div><hr />

What you do with your computer in your spare time is up to you. :p<br />
<br />
I develop my presets on my 800 laptop. Downstaris we have a Duron 2000, 512 megs dual channel ram, Radeon 9700 pro :)<br />
<br />
That's my gaming machine, and it runs AVS blindingly fast. It's also the reason I was my pack to be easily speed tweakable. (I just have to make my name out of one superscope :igor: )</div></div><hr />
