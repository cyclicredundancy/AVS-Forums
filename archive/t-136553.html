      <p class="post-content"><strong>Polarized 3d (Passive Stereo Projection)</strong><br />
      I think I have figured out that AVS does not work with stereo projection on LCD projectors where audience members where polarized glasses. Is there other "winamp visualization" software that will allow for this. I believe the main key is that it has to be Direct3D. Thanks for any information you could provide.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I doubt you'll get the required help from here. We're just AVS. Try <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=12" target="_blank">here</a>, that will probably help you more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are programs around (though I don't know any names) which filter your whole screen to stereo. Even some of the Yllama screens (or however you spell it) have it as a standard option built-in. You might want to try that, coz if that works, it'll work with avs as well.</p>
