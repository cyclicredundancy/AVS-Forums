<div class="posttext">My preset 'winamp vis' wasn't good enough? oh dang :p<br />
<br />
Hmm... there are so many different spectrum presets already, but none of them probably are like the mini vis on winamp, atleast like on winamp5 default modern skin. I mean, why would you want something that you already have? ;) Making it again in avs seems like a waste of time imo. That said i realized that my winamp vis preset is just that... lol :blah:<br />
<br />
Anyway, that little spectrum analyzer is very possible and quite easy to make too, but majority of the avsters here don't do requests.<br />
<br />
But im on a nice mood so if i can i'll try to make it somewhere around this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you....all the way from Alice Springs, Australia. Nice to know that good people exist in cyberspace!! I want the vis to fill up the width of my screen, that's the reason for the request. I am an audiophile and I like to see the technical aspect of my music although some of the eye candy out there is amazing.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to Monday Arvo.<br />

<div class="posttext">Ok here it is, a bit plain and simple, but that's what you wanted :)<br />
Anyway didn't have much time to work on it to add some cool things like interactive menus or that kinda stuff-o which i did had in mind.<br />
Hope this will do.<br />
<br />
You can still make your own adjustments in the first superscope :)</div></div><hr />
