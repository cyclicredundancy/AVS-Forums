      Is there any way to make the visualizations as screensavers in windows? If not, where can I get some screensavers for windows xp that are like the avs or visualizations for winamp?</p>

      First, you have to convert the AVS presets you want into an AVI file. This is best done with an APE, such as the AVSGrabber by UnConeD. After you have the AVS presets captured as an AVI, then you can use a program such as ScreenTime (<a href="http://www.screentime.com" target="_blank">www.screentime.com</a>). You'll want to download the Photo-Video version. BTW: The screen savers you make will only work for a week unless you purchase the full version. I haven't looked for any other programs yet. That should get you started.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>one more thing</strong><br />
      If you change the size of the window you're capturing from (with a APE like the AVSGrabber I mentioned earlier), then you can make it appear faster or slower in the screen saver (which is cool because you can get it faster fullscreen). One disadvantage of making it small is that the pixels are stretched more-so you have to keep a balance between the two<br />

      <br />
      GeissWerks and Drempels can both be set up as a screensaver. Goto <a href="http://www.geisswerks.com/" target="_blank">http://www.geisswerks.com/</a> to get them. They're by the same guy who wrote Milkdrop. (another neat vis program)</p>

      <p class="post-content">huh? But cmountford just said you can. Though it would just be a copy of the the avs in action replaying over and over again if i understood cmountford correctly. Sorta like a vcr.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>You can't with AVS alone</strong><br />
      You can't automatically set AVS presets as a screensaver. You can build your own using a combination of APE addins for Winamp AVS and a compiler that will combine AVI video files into a screensaver. That's how I was suggesting to do it.<br />
      <br />
      In order to be able for the program such as ScreenTime Photo &amp; Video to be able to make you a screen saver, it needs photos or video files-in this case, we need to capture your AVS files &amp; save them as an AVI file. This is most easily done with a downloadable APE called AVSGrabber, by UnConeD. With AVSGrabber, it can capture parts of the video of the output of AVS presets &amp; turn it into an AVI video file.<br />
      <br />
      You'lll need to save several .AVI video files (you need to decide how long to display each preset-and that's how long you'll let AVSGrabber capture your presets for). It's a good idea to have several .AVI files you'll capture using AVSGrabber located in a special folder.<br />
      <br />
      After you have your AVI files made, then you can use the ScreenTime Photo &amp; Video program to combine your AVI video files into a screensaver. Note: in order for your screen savers to work for more than a week, you'll have to purchase the full version of ScreenTime.<br />
      <br />
      --You can't set individual AVS files as a screensaver; but you can manipulate them into formats that you can use as a screen saver.--<br />
      <br />
      Sorry about the confusion. Hope that cleared things up a little bit :)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>screensaver almost ready</strong><br />
      I've almost got a screen saver ready-but I need to e-mail the company about a few bugs &amp; other stuff.<br />
      <br />
      It is possible-but it's going to be a whole lot more demanding on your computer than normal screen savers will be (I guess it's just using compressed .avi files-I'd always thought it'd compile them into some sort of code to make it run more like a traditional screen saver). Just thought I'd make an update.<br />
