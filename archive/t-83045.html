		I've already made a similar post, however, I didn't get a single reply. I was quite dissapointed, honestly. Not to say I can blame anyone, but this time I'd at least like a few replies. Also, if I've used someone else's work without giving proper credit or authorization (if nessisary), it would be nice to know so that I can edit (heavily) or remove it.<br />

		My two favourites were 'electron cloud' (the first one) and 'electric space dandelion' (minus the bump, it sped it up).<br />
<br />
Overall I found it a bit hard on the eyes, what with the brightness of some and rapid colour changes in others. Some were a bit chaotic for my taste.<br />
<br />
Not my bag overall. Nice effort, but not for me.
