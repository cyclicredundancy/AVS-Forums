			<strong>Making a superscope engine in VB</strong><br />
		
		

		Im trying to make my own standalone superscope engine.<br />
<br />
I dont think it is possible to make run-time editable code in VB..<br />
anyone know any ways.. (in vb, im not ready for this sortof thing in c++ yet.)

		It is possible to make run-time editable code in VB.  Not very easy to do, though.  Especially to make it music responsive.  It would require a lot of programming knowledge to make.

		I made ssc engine in Turbo Pascal 7.0 AND it was easy to, but making the thing move and rotate correctli without flashing effect is much more harder. ;)

		Jack, you made an engine with full run-time code parsing? If so, then why not go work for nullsoft on avs3 :D

		No No No Nooo....<br />
No run-time code parsing...<br />
All must be configured in the program... :(<br />
Full run-time code parsing is impossible to make it in SO OLD and SO CRAPPY programming language like pascal is. Besides no-one has ever tought me programming, all is learned by myself (programming lessons will start in 12-th grave :cry: ).<br />
<br />
BTW<br />
I got one question. Im starting to learn (by myself) C++ or JAVA. Witch one is better, what to you all reccomend?

		Java is cross-platform even when compiledd, the holy grail of object-oriented programming, but slow. It has garbage collection.<br />
Loved by some. Comes with a very extensive API.<br />
<br />
C++ is still the 'toughest' language today, in that it can still do pretty much anything. Carries a lot of heritage from C, which can be a good or bad thing (allows you to go outside strict OO).<br />
Modern C++ (i.e. standard C++, with references, templates, ...) is too cool for its own good, but it can take a long time to fully grasp everything and be able to use it well.<br />
C++ is more bare bones than the java environment, but there are already a ton of libraries around that can help you do pretty much anything, if you can get them to compile on your platform.

		Thank UnConeD.<br />
Yea, eh. Object-oriented programming has been hardest for me till now. I think that im going to learn C++ then.

		I wish you good luck Jack.  Especially if you are going to try to learn it on your own.  It is very hard to get good beginner's tutorials, etcetera.  I would reccommend buying a computer science textbook from some college.  These tend to be the best at explaining C++.  Of course, if you already know another similar language(Java, etc) you may not need something that expensive.  Good luck and can't wait to see what you make.

		Nice avatar Anubis.<br />
I allready got one tutorial, its kinda old but it will do it. This seems to be britty good too and easy for me, who sleeps in english classes and hasent done his homeworks for allready 5 years :D.<br />
I allready got some experience on TP 7.0 but it wwwaaaaayyyy too old and easy to compare it with C++

		Thanks, but it's really not that great(just simple frame transitions).  I'm going to make something in AVS - any ideas?<br />
<br />
If you are understanding it, then that is good.  Whenever you learn something make sure you mess around with it for a couple of minutes of coding.  Otherwise you may not remember it later on.

		Yeah, I screwed up my parents computer once messing around getting rid of old file types.  I accidentally deleted the .lnk file type(what all shortcuts on the computer use).  That's when they learned how to use my computer.

		There's nothing wrong with TP 7. I knew some guys in highschool the won 6th (or 7th) place at assembly '96 (I think it was) with a demo coded in TP 7.<br />
<br />
Seeing as you do know pascal, this might help.<br />

		The code in there should be pretty portable to C. There's a fair bit of assembly anyway.

		Using Visual Basic one could write a good command parser, the only problem though is rendering is too goddamn slow.
