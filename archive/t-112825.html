		Hi ppl...<br />
<br />
I've been playing a while with avs, but now, I want to recreate some efects on a game that I'm doing!!<br />
<br />
I've want to know where I can find some references on how to make some renders, tranformations avs like, how to do beat detection, etc..<br />
<br />
I'm using openGL, SDL and Fmod!!!<br />
<br />
Filami:)

		I doubt you'll find much help here, most people are into making AVS presets, not making AVS :).<br />
<br />
Besides, if you're going to use OpenGL, you're going to work with a vastly different approach than AVS. AVS works the image directly (using optimized assembly), while with OpenGL you're letting the graphics card do all the work. The obvious advantage of OpenGL is speed, but you're more limited in what you can do and how you can do it.<br />
<br />
I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.flipcode.com" target="_blank">www.flipcode.com</a>, it's a great game-programming website. Search their forums and the library of articles they have.

		Also...PLEASE surf the forums a bit before you post.  This isn't a very reprehensible post in that it's not a very stupid question, but if you'd checked out the majority of the posts you'd find out (rather quickly) that AVS isn't open-source; thus we wouldn't know how any of the effects are produced.
