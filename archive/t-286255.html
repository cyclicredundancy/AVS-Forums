<div class="posttext">I've had an idea in my head for a few days now for a kind of compilation pack.<br />
I want to get whoever's interested to either make a preset, or find a favourite of theirs to submit, however, i also want them to submit an mp3, perhaps your favourite, but one that works well with your chosen preset.<br />
The idea is to not only get a look at some nice (hopefully) presets, but also to let other avs'ers out there watch your preset to your music.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">..and then what, put it on piratebay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well including mp3s it'd be too big to upload here.<br />
i'd make sure that they were 128kpbs mp3s at the most to save filesize.<br />
I suppose i would have to torrent it.<br />
unless someone's willing to host the file on their site &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">was more of a copyright concern</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah i suppose that is an issue.<br />
well i could always torrent the mp3s separately and if anyone wants to be naughty they can get it.<br />
<br />
twas just an idea</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i'll lend my visualnoobs webspace.<br />
thats about 100mbs of space.<br />
that should be quite sufficient for the pack.<br />
rapidshare the file to charpoketron at hotmail.com if your interested and i'll set up the links to the file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Might be easier to restrict to freely available mp3s... or perhaps one you created yourself.<br />
<br />
EDIT: e.g. OCRemixes :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i have to go with jheriko on this.<br />
as stated winamp does not want any affiliation with illegal or pirated anything.<br />
better stick open remixes at www.download.com everything there is for free. and there is no legal anything about it. so long as we don't sell the files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't think this will work so easily. <br />
Who wants to download a avs pack via rapidshare, or torrent.<br />
<br />
The better Way would be to give some notes like &quot;try this song with this preset&quot;.<br />
How the people get those songs is their own problem then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i can keep the music on my site and apply direct links to them.<br />
that way they won't be bundled with the pack.<br />
just point to my site and the rest should work from there.</div></div><hr />
