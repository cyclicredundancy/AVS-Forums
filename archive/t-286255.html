      <p class="post-content"><strong>The Sounds of AVS</strong><br />
      I've had an idea in my head for a few days now for a kind of compilation pack.<br />
      I want to get whoever's interested to either make a preset, or find a favourite of theirs to submit, however, i also want them to submit an mp3, perhaps your favourite, but one that works well with your chosen preset.<br />
      The idea is to not only get a look at some nice (hopefully) presets, but also to let other avs'ers out there watch your preset to your music.<br />
      <br />
      Thoughts?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well including mp3s it'd be too big to upload here.<br />
      i'd make sure that they were 128kpbs mp3s at the most to save filesize.<br />
      I suppose i would have to torrent it.<br />
      unless someone's willing to host the file on their site &gt;.&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah i suppose that is an issue.<br />
      well i could always torrent the mp3s separately and if anyone wants to be naughty they can get it.<br />
      <br />
      twas just an idea</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'll lend my visualnoobs webspace.<br />
      thats about 100mbs of space.<br />
      that should be quite sufficient for the pack.<br />
      rapidshare the file to charpoketron at hotmail.com if your interested and i'll set up the links to the file.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Might be easier to restrict to freely available mp3s... or perhaps one you created yourself.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: e.g. OCRemixes :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i have to go with jheriko on this.<br />
      as stated winamp does not want any affiliation with illegal or pirated anything.<br />
      better stick open remixes at <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank">www.download.com</a> everything there is for free. and there is no legal anything about it. so long as we don't sell the files.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think this will work so easily.<br />
      Who wants to download a avs pack via rapidshare, or torrent.<br />
      <br />
      The better Way would be to give some notes like "try this song with this preset".<br />
      How the people get those songs is their own problem then.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i can keep the music on my site and apply direct links to them.<br />
      that way they won't be bundled with the pack.<br />
      just point to my site and the rest should work from there.</p>
