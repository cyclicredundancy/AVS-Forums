		Alright I'm trying to come up with a decent effect to throw on my polyhedron without killing the framerate.  I've come up with a [very] simple effect and would like to see what others think and any ideas they may have.

		i looked at the conv filter and colourmap after it crashed and recreated it, not bad, it basically just looks a bit green and with a 50/50 blend and linewidth set to 3 or something. If thats what its supposed to be i would do a little more with it, at least give it some sort of glow or something like that.
