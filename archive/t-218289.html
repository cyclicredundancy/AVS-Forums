<br />
<div class="posttext">tips:<br />
<br />
lets wait a while before 'officially starting' with a bigger deadline<br />
<br />
submit presets here for comments suggestions before finally sending to wotl (or whoever is organising... but wotl has been doing an ok job so far as far as i'm concerned).<br />
<br />
submitting presets here will also allow selective and perhaps multiple remixing which will hopefully get some better quality of remixes out with pack.<br />
<br />
we should let people only make presets or only remix if they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
feel free to diss these suggestions at leisure below. i understand particularly why posting presets here might not be considered a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 14:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay if we're getting serious about these suggestions:<br />
<br />
1.) I think we should have a bit of quality control. A lot of people commented on wfc1&amp;2 that there was a big variation in quality throughout the pack, I know we want to accurately represent the community, but I'm not sure including presets from people like Kookee really does that.<br />
<br />
2.) Remixes, I thought there were too many in wfc2, and generally the quality of a remix is worse than that of an original preset (yes I know there are definately exceptions to this); Again its a bit of a quality control issue, why not do the remixes but let the community chose the best 5 or 10 and put them in.<br />
<br />
I realise its nice to keep the presets a secret before releasing the pack, and these ideas conflict with that a bit, so any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 14:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Im not too hot about posting here for comments and improvement, because i know PAK would bite my head off right away :hang:<br />
<br />
I like the idea for selecting what you want to remix, but i still like to be surprised when the final pack comes out... hmm this is one tough cookie.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should just vote and see how the chips fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 16:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I agree to tug! Though i'm sure that i never submit really crappy stuff i'm also not that eager for getting taken to pieces.<br />
<br />
But i've got an idea how we could ensure 'quality control' while most people will still be surprised by the finished product: what if we'd set up a jury of let's say 2-3 &quot;well-known-AVS'ers&quot; who would collect all the presets in the first place? Now they could discuss the submitted presets among each other and separately confer with each participant (if necessary). At first i'd suggest WotL to be one of the jurors. The other one(s) could be voted or something.<br />
<br />
Proposition is put to discussion.... now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 17:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Seems like a good idea to me. Only problem might be that what the jurors consider a good preset might not be shared by everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">what do you mean now tug? :weird:<br />
Seems that i didn't get your double-negation :p<br />
<br />
About the proposal: let's all just name a few people that will be asked if they run for that job. After that we could make a poll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 22:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm kinda against posting presets as an attachment.. people that post their presets early automatically get more attention drawn to them..<br />
<br />
My variaton on this otherwise fine idea: <br />
<br />
  Mail the presets to the one who's running WFC3 aka MrX. (I don't mind if that would be me)<br />
  After all presets are in (or after the deadline), MrX will post all presets in the forum.<br />
<br />
  Remixes are free for whoever wants to. I'm not sure wether they should be posted here or emailed to MrX.. ideas?<br />
  We'll set a limit to the amounts of remixes (originals too if it's needed), depending on the ammount of contributions<br />
  Remixes (and originals too if needed) are rated by: <br />
  1)a poll afterwards, all at once <br />
or<br />
  2)when released by commenting (usual 0.5 to 5 stars)<br />
  The highest rated remixes (or originals) make it to the pack<br />
<br />
<br />
how about this?<br />
further ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th June 2005, 23:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">1) i vote for WotL as 'Mr.X'! :)<br />
<br />
2) But i somehow dislike the idea that all stuff is public before the pack is released. Cause its just so much fun to get surprised by the final pack!<br />
Though, considered by itself, the process WotL suggested seems ok and fair to me.</div></div><hr />

well, if it's just that: set up a maximum limit for every participant! E.g. two remixes at the most or something...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thats still too many, I prefer the jury idea, that way its still a surprise for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2005, 02:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I like ^..^'s jury idea as well, that way the pack would retain high quality presets. But the jury would have to be very well selected, as to avoid discrimination.<br />
<br />
Also, to maybe expand on ^..^'s idea a bit: set up the jury of three artists. If two vote for a preset to be put in the pack, it will be submitted.<br />
<br />
I agree that there were too many remixes as well. They're fun, but I always like the originals better. I think the same jury should later vote for remixes.<br />
<br />
Another thought I just had: We might create the jury of willing artists who won't be contributing to this pack, to further ensure that there is no discrimination. There's a lot of other artists in the community who don't visit these forums as often, or those who wouldn't submit to this pack for various reasons. I'm sure there's at least three other avsers whose judgment we can trust. We could get one &quot;techy&quot; guy, one &quot;arty&quot; guy and maybe even a retired artist who still has some fascination with avs. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's just my two cents...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">posting here was just a thought, its a shame we dont have a WFC private forum, it would just make doing stuff like this in secret a lot easier.<br />
<br />
 i sort of expected no one to like the idea... hence my comment at the end of the post.<br />
<br />
the jury idea sounds like a good alternative.<br />
<br />
on the subject of remixes. i think less is more about 50% the original number of presets is ideal imo, 150% as a max limit. too many more remixes than presets is excessive. it might be nice if we remixed some of the previous wfc presets... or maybe even random presets by wfc artists for some variation. the less of the same preset you see in a pack the better :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I reckon we should have free remixing, and we select the best from each person, as otheriwse if we have 10 remixes it might be 3 tugg, 3 pak-9, 3 jheriko and 1 for the rest of us to squabble over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2005, 18:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">1) i like denkensiefursich's suggestion to ask artists who do not participate at all to do the jury-job! That way really no one knows the result before it's released.<br />
<br />
2) I appreciate your idea jheriko! But is there any chance to set up a private forum or something else actually? Where we could discuss all those fundamental things bout the pack?<br />
<br />
3) The suggestion mysterious_w made is also ok. But we should also ensure that not unconditionaly one preset and remix from every participant is added to the pack, just because he wants to contribute. Cause then we'd skip the quality control we wanted to have. But at least we can keep an eye on versatility of artists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th June 2005, 19:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Maybe if there were more than 3 jury members then the jury could participate also. For example if we had 4 jury members and if jury member A makes a preset and atleast 2 of the 3 left over jury members agree of it's quality it's accepted.<br />
<br />
Well something like that, i'll leave the refining of the idea to you because im tired and i need to go to bed :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">to be honest i wouldnt mind completely dodging the remix phase again, that should help keep the number of remixes down. :)<br />

as regards to the private forum, why not just discuss it more on #avs. several of us go there already, and we already give each other feedback and help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ok, but still we have to vote how we want to proceed this time. and if we chose the jury-idea we also have to elect their members.<br />
<br />
So, i vote for the jury idea with 3-4 jurors.<br />
And as such i suggest the established artists (in alphabetical order):<br />
<br />
Jheriko<br />
PAK-9<br />
Tuggummi<br />
WotL<br />
<br />
again, these are just my suggestions. So feel free to ditch it if you don't agree!</div></div><hr />

As far as I'm concerned we start late August, <br />
but I'd like to know what your (&lt;- aimed at everyone) opinions are about the amount of presets/remixes, which ones to remix etc..<br />

IMHO it's just too much too keep in one thread and to split them out in the root of AVS will make it messy, so that's basically why I set up a seperate forum</div></div><hr />

<br />
Presets: Max 2 per person<br />
Remixes: People can make as many as they want (and whomever they want) but the jury will just pick the best 'n' (where n is 30-50% the total number of original presets)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">that's the problem actually. One the one hand people would like to decide which presets they recieve for remixing, but on the other hand they want to be surpirsed by the final pack.<br />
<br />
anyway, i for my part liked the way we proceeded with remixes last time: i just got a little bunch of presets and decided which of them i wanted to remix.<br />
<br />
But nevertheless, if someone doesn't want to get eg. too tech-heavy presets etc. for remixing he can tell it (to Mr.X/ or the Jury/ or only post it) so that he'll only get presets of a certain kind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree with ^..^ on that one; the way we proceeded the last tmie suited me just fine.<br />
<br />
But I also agree that some sort of presets are harder for some to remix. We all know each other's styles pretty well, and it's not very hard to distinguish what style of presets someone would prefer to remix.<br />
<br />
I don't know if WotL took that into consideration the last time, but it seemed so to me.</div></div><hr />

In WFC1 I checked who would be capable of remixing who..<br />
in WFC2 I did it alphabetical because people complained about the method used in WFC1.<br />
<br />
say there are 4 artists:<br />
A<br />
B<br />
C<br />
D<br />
<br />
A was given the presets from B and D;<br />
B was given the presets from A and C;<br />

I've got one preset that's about 90% done. All I need to do is find a cheaper(fps) way to achieve the color effects. The other preset I'm working on is still in its eariler stages, about 25% done.<br />

The holidays are over, so I suppose everybody is back, and in some way able to read this..<br />
You now have one month to email me your latest presets.<br />
<br />
Also, we use this month to discuss how we will make WFC3 a succes for everyone.<br />
<br />
About the judging theory that has been discussed, I suggest we wait with that until we're sure that we will have too many presets and mixes to form a good pack.<br />
I'll keep you informed of who submited how many presets on my forum. (I can't edit my posts here after +2hours)<br />

Want to join? Just mail (no more than) two of your latest presets to my gmail address.<br />

<div class="posttext">Well so how is one this working now, did we decide? What happens when all the originals have been submitted? Were you going to submit them to your forum, WotL, for discussion and remixing? Will voting be taking place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th September 2005, 22:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Voting will only take place if the amount of presets gets too large (which I'm hoping :p). <br />
I'm thinking about a maximum of 30 presets in total. (Discussion goes here (http://www.dolfschimmel.nl/~wotl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=31&amp;sid=d6db9633af849f7b25cf1bb8e232a685))<br />
<br />
About the remixing.. I think the way we did WFC2 went rather well - every artist receives the presets (2+2=~4) from two other random artists and submits the best remixes. <br />
If several people are only able to submit only one preset (losers ;p), then perhaps it should be done per three artists (1+2+1=~4). Other ideas are of course welcome. (please post them as a seperate thread on the other forum)<br />
<br />
If there are too many presets, then we should indeed have some voting system. I'm not sure yet how that will happen, but I prefer to wait with thinking about that until the first deadline - then we'll know the amount of originals, and if that's lower than that of the previous compilations, then there'll be most likely no need to trim it down. If it's bigger, then we still have the second month to decide how to cut which one out.<br />
<br />
But as long as it isn't necessary, I don't want to remove stuff. <br />
I know I really wouldn't like it if someone chose to remove my stuff from a pack, and I guess it's the same for you guys.<br />
<br />
But if we need to, we need to. (yea, I'm stating the obvious, I know)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">okay, here goes:<br />
<br />
status after the first deadline<br />
Today is October 4th, a few days after the deadline.<br />
I received 9 presets from 5 different artists, +two from me and a remix from a previous compilaton. <br />
That's 11 presets that can be put up for remixing.<br />
<br />
Artists who have submitted their preset(s)<br />
^..^<br />
MrNudge<br />
Boktor<br />
StevenRoy<br />
Denkensiefursich<br />
Tuggummi<br />
Warrior of the Light<br />
<br />
Again, every artist recieves the presets from two other participating artists, meaning that everyone has about four presets to remix.<br />
<br />
It's really a slim number of original presets, but if everyone submits two remixes, there'll be enough for a pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2005, 22:28</div></div>

<div class="posttext">So what do you plan on setting the remix deadline for? End of this month? Or just a couple of weeks?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, that does sound rather slim.<br />
<br />
Seems to me like it might be necessary (or at least a good idea) to extend that deadline by a week or two, in case some of the others here just need a little more time to get their presets ready and sent in. (After all, I'm sure we all know how much a person can be delayed by homework... or, even worse, work!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th October 2005, 22:51</div></div>

<div class="posttext">@Tug: Didn't you get a mail from WotL yet?<br />
To me he said that the next deadline shall be the 31th of October (which is rather short for me atm, but i will just try my best). Well, we'll see then.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what shall we do if someone else wants to contribute some presets after now? (I doubt that, but it still might happen...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've noticed the last two compilations that 98% of all submissions are submitted either within the first week or within five days before the deadline. A longer deadline makes artists lazy. Take pak-9 here for example (not a personal attack). First he forgets the deadline, later he also forgets to submit presets. Again, this is just an example, not a personal attack.<br />
<br />
The next deadline will be the October 31st, 23:59 unless someone can give me a good explanation of how this extra time would be used/needed.<br />
Think for yourself, not for others.<br />
<br />
New submissions will be too late and will not be included, as the presets have already been shared.<br />
I've waited 3 more days before spreading the presets only to give these people a chance.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the deadline shall be fine for me too!<br />
<br />
btw: What about the much dicussed voting to limit the packsize? I mean, since there most probably won't be so many presets in the end we don't really need that, or what do you say?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">My thoughts:<br />
If there are too many remixes after the next deadine, then I'll email the remixes to the participants vor voting within a specified short time (week?).<br />
<br />
But then, my thoughts are worth just as much as anyone elses  on this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I find that pretty funny: we were discussing about this thing during the whole summer, and in the end we might won't need it! :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, im feeling that i was a bit too fast on this. Probably we should better wait until we know how many remixes there are. But if we'll need something to shrink the size i'd also say: let's make it as simple as possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If you still need presets, I can provide one. It's a remix that didn't make it into my pack, because it looked too similar to the original. However I think it's good enough and I just don't know what to do with it. I'd be grateful if you can find any use for it.<br />
If you're interested, tell me where to submit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Raz! Great to see you back here..<br />
<br />
@Qforce, Raz:<br />
Well, there is no way that you two can participate in the remixing part, that's for sure.<br />
Also, I feel I would offend you and the others if I said I'd put them in as 'filler' if there wouldn't be enough presets.<br />
<br />
@Everyone:<br />
How about it if we'd put them up vor voting together with all other presets/remixes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2005, 19:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nah, i personnaly don't like that idea. Actually we had a deadline and it's unfair if we accept later submitted presets (i think tug already found the fitting words for this...). Besides, we discussed about the voting as an idea to limit down the packsize so why shall we vote when we need &quot;filler&quot;-presets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Suppose we do this in two stages: First, one group (the on-time group) submits our presets (like we already did) and then remix each other's presets (like we're currently doing)... and then the second group (the latecomers) can submit their presets during November, then remix each other's presets in December, and then have them left out of the pack anyway because they suck. :D</div></div><hr />

Raz:<br />

While I agree with Tug, if all others are reluctant for this to be put in this pack, you should either release it singly... or just send it to me. :D<br />

Nah, just joking, you were just doing your &quot;job&quot; which is ungrateful already as it is. Though i have to say that you did choose of a rather unfair ground to &quot;pick on&quot;, because colors are a highly individual thing in my opinion. Other people like blue and other red and believe it or not, but some people even like a &quot;xor coloring&quot; (those weirdoes... :p), it's just the way it is.<br />
<br />
But it's easy for me to be diplomatic, since i was not attacked (more like i was spared and all the others were attacked), so i think you should...<br />

I won't flame you for the review, you're absolutely right if you say that the overall quality is lower than WFC2. But then, keep in mind that the toppers are missing and there are a lot of new people. <br />
I say that those people did an outstanding job to prove themselves.<br />
<br />
What I did miss in this compilation were mostly the missing remixes. Especially Tugg's preset was a good preset for remixing, but unfortunately noone did.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd have prefered it if you had reviewed it as a new pack, and not as one-in-the-line-of, since half of the people are different, but that's just my 2ct<br />
<br />
I fully agree with the ratings though.<br />

<div class="posttext">Me too. There are some cool things that can be done with XOR, but way too many uncool things. (I thought the subtle XOR effect in &quot;The Convicts&quot; was a nice touch, though.)<br />
<br />
I also would've liked to see more remixes, but it's not too late; some WFC3 remixes can go in WFC4, for example, right?<br />
<br />
I'll also agree that colour is a very subjective thing. For example, I noticed one negative comment on DA specifically about the colours in my &quot;Convection Conviction&quot; remix. I loved those wild &quot;hot and cold&quot; colours, like fireballs in a freezer. Perhaps they were too wild for most people, though? Similarly, I put the framerate limiter in &quot;Apple To My Eye&quot; partially to mimic the limited processor power of the Apple II, but mostly just because I thought it looked better with it than without it. I spent a while on that decision, and I stand by it.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, I could've used &quot;Apple To My Eye&quot; as the background for the title. Now that would've been something! (In fact, I probably could do something like that for WFC4, but I've already got another idea...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, despite the comments in that review, four stars seems pretty good to me. Still, let's hope next time will be better!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ouch.<br />
<br />
I'll agree that this is certainly a fair rating, going so far as to even agreeing that a 4 is a bit high, in respect to the quality of presets. I hope not to add insult to injury, but I personally didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the previous compilations either.<br />
<br />
That said, I never thought of this as a pack which would portray the best works in the community, more as a pack which protrayed our individual styles to the greatest extent. We're not going to please everyone, by a long shot. And if you're doing avs for the comments and the praise, you're in it for the wrong reasons. I create presets because I enjoy it. I like working out the problems encountered, as well as being able to express myself through this means as an artform. In that respect, I give this pack a 5, as well as a favorite on deviantART.<br />
<br />
Now, in response the XOR comments, if anyone was referring to my preset (if not, ignore this paragraph :p), I thought it added a nice touch for the artistic side of it. I spent a few days trying to keep it real subtle, as I usually hate it as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, I agree about some of the color schemes as well, but, as with others, I agree that it's subjective. Again, however, if it pleases the artist, that's what should matter.<br />
<br />
Anyway, through all of this, I'm still very much looking forward to WFC4. Let's hope it's a whizbang. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally, It's a good pack, but it does sort of disappoint. I was expecting to be blown sockless by the visuals and the sheer &quot;How DO they do it?&quot; factor. Granted, I don't plan to release a rival pack anytime soon, but I was expecting more jaws dropping (too good a reputation could be a bad thing).</div></div><hr />
