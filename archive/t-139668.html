      <p class="post-content"><strong>overlay work with ati mobility 9000 32mb?</strong><br />
      Was wondering if anyone can tell me if the video overlay works on the ati mobility 9000, esp. on the Dell Inspiron 5150 laptop?<br />
      <br />
      By works I mean that you are able to get a full screen image on the 2nd monitor.<br />
      <br />
      I would assume that it doesn't as the ati mobility 7500 on the Dell 5100 doesn't.<br />
      <br />
      It finally working on my dell 8200 with geforce2go card after fighting with Dell for over a year to release working drivers.<br />
      <br />
      My experiences with overlay are similar to babyjacko's post about Radeon and overlay in this forum.<br />

      <p class="post-content">If the card supports overlay then it will work. It is very difficult to get it set up so that AVS works correctly with it, but it isn't impossible. One easier way is to just use multiple desktops and drag the AVS window over to your 2nd monitor - that normally works.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thank for the reply anubis but as i stated in my orig. email, having the overlay feature does not mean it will work, in fact, i've found that it almost never works! the problem seems to be with the drivers.<br />
      <br />
      also, i don't want to use multiple desktops as you have to make the tv the primary display and that sucks b/c you get windows boxes popping up, etc.<br />
      <br />
      i'd just like to find a new laptop that is works on, luckily it finally does on my current i8200 w/ geforce2go.</p>
