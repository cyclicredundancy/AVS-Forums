		Lol, I realize most people don't care. But I got a hold of all the APEs that have been used for Winamp. Be warned, a lot of these may crash Winamp, and I understand that none of the old 3D APEs will work in Win XP. But as a historical oddity, if you are interested, reply here and I will zip them up for you. I would do it anyway, but there are a couple of dozen of them and some are quite big.:D

		Right you are, Ishan. The one thread that lists all of the apes (before this) was very messy an long, full of broken links and defunct sites. I figured This would be a little cleaner, considering nobody is going to be asking for them anyway (much less than from a noob like me). :D

		you're idea is surely generous and well-meant, but i guess a bit unnecessary. Cause as ishan said already the frequent people here have all required ape's. Of course, new people need them, but to be honest how many noobs came here in the past time?

		Your negative attitudes are all well and good.. but the old page is a pile of poo. It might be better to have a cleaner list. You'll appreciate it when you need to find a lot of apes for whatever reason. (reformat etc...)

		Thanks, jheriko. Hm, but I'm thinking maybe I should just go ahead and zip up each APE individually and post them one at a time here. Or should I just go ahead and wait for someone to ask? (And all the time this thread is getting longer and messier...);)

		well if you <b>have</b> to post the thread, the i'll suggest that you get this thread deleted by UCD, start a whole new thread with properly formatted post(s) contaning all the APE's (in zip files individually,coz i think that links can get broken somehow) with a short description of the APE, what it does, its maker and version no.<br />
Then get the thread locked and stickied by UCD again :)<br />
<br />
I guess that would be fair enough.

		i think we shouldnt list narrow-purpose APEs<br />
also we shouldnt list outdated apes (like setlinewidth, sorry shreyas :))<br />
<br />
also we should restrict the number of APEs that dont enhance AVS's capabilities or speed for a particular purpose<br />
that would include these:<br />
RGB Filter: can be done easily with color modifier<br />
Screen Reverse: can be done with movement<br />
Negative Strobe: noone wants crappy strobe effects :P also, this can be easily done with color modifier

		Jeez, I should have known that there would be apes I don't have. here's a list of all the ones I've come across I suppose they are pretty common after all. (I never even heard of 'stickman').<br />
                              <br />

                            vf2.ape<br />
                            VfxAviPlayer.ape<br />
<br />
Obviously I listed 'narrow purpose' apes and ones already integrated into winamp. I am a newbie, so I don't remember all the apes that may have been around over the last few years. Also obviously, I am going to need help on this. I suggest we all list all the apes we can think of and then a couple of people will have to go back and clean up the list, and then finally any apes that are not actually owned by someone here will have to be searched out, or at least find out for sure if they exist anymore. (I had a bitch of a time finding tv.) Oh, and incidentally, my idea was to collect ALL the apes we can. Yes negative strobe looks crappy and is easily accomplished by other means, so are tv and conway for that matter. I thought the list should be more comprehensive than 'useful'. (I can't even get 'ifs.ape' to apply. It crashes my winamp every single time.)

		Aww, is that nice Tuggummi? I never said it was a 'good' or even a useful idea. I'm running it up the flagpole to see who salutes, that's all. Some people seem to find it an interesting enough idea to be discussing it. I'm sorry you don't feel the same. Gee, I hope everybody doesn't drop out now because the Great Tuggummi thinks it's stupid. :p (Tugg, I am still a fan.) I am the first to admit I'm noob, but I daresay even the best AVSer was once a newbie. Except maybe PAK-9 and UCD.:D<br />
<br />
Anyway...Yes, back to the topic at hand. Once I get the ones I missed I will go back and put them in alpha order (I had them that way, but I tried to list them in collums. Obviously it didn't work. Hence the 2 posts.:hang: I always forget about the little edit button, damnit. I will go look for those 2 apes, ^..^ unless you yourself have them?

		oh, except someone else needs to write a description for 'ifs.ape' because mine will not run at all. It makes my WA curl up in a little ball every time, so I don't even know what it looks like.

		actually, i only saw successfué packs till now that were successful without any plus apes except the ones that came with WA5. okay, flock (or if you prefer flock off) is a handy thing, but that can be also coded with a tiny superscope.<br />
add borders is instead of a 1-scope solution too ;)<br />
<br />
triangle, avstrans automation, global variable manager ape are really useful though.<br />

		Damn it, I need more help than I thought. Please believe me, I started this, and I will do all of it if possible. But There are some apes I don't understand, and some that are called something different in the AVS editor. Like CLS Dynamic, I don't know what the editor calls it. And AVS grabber, I don't understand this one. It has to do with processing .avi and .avs files (perhaps converting or combining them?) Sorry, I'm a bonehead when it comes to video compression stuff. :(<br />
<br />
I will post the list as best as I can, and then UnConeD or someone else qualified can update the descriptions that I couldn't get. (It shouldn't be many):)<br />
<br />
Aggh, edit. Why cant I remember? globemgr is there, jheriko. If it isn't listed, I have it, so it will be in the final.

		Ok, START LIST:<br />
<br />
3D: appears in render apes. projects a 3 demensional image (programmed seprately as .asc files) onto the screen. You can change the color. This is an old effect and nobody uses it much anymore. There is no author name listed in the editor.

		Should I not yet? How else would we do it? the list will have to be cleaned up still, but I have no idea how we go about it.<br />
<br />
See, these descriptions are a nightmare. I just have know way of obtaining some of the information . I was hoping someone else could just sort of 'fill in the blanks'. <br />
<br />
BTW, I see the downside of non-integrated apes now. I NEVER want to see another ape. :D

		I'd suggest just to post <b>ONE</b> zip-file containing <b>ALL</b> ape's together with <b>ONE</b> list giving all background information. Or at the most do it in two posts to prevent the thread from getting broken/loading problems if it gets to huge. But 30 or so single posts are just too much (=confusing)!!<br />
<br />
eg do it like this:<br />
<ul><li><u>name of apefile - <b>name inside of AVS</b> - <i>short description and/or author</i></u><br /></li>
<li>cls_dynamic.ape - <b>Dynamic Clear Screen</b> - <i> render ape that offers customizable settings... blablabla by shreyas_potnis</i></li>
<li>...</li>

		ah, see I already made a txt file of all the info I could acertain. (I have that info on the ones where I could get it, but not neccessarliy in that order.) I don't want to go back and re-figure it all out now. I aplogize for the messiness, but it's still more organized than it was. I am really brain dead right now (really bad cold), and I just can't process that much right now. :(<br />
 <br />
Honestly I aplogize for not realizing what I was getting into. <br />
But I do want to thank everyone who kept talking and made it a worthwhile project.:up: <br />
<br />
and it will have to be in 4 or 5 posts, considering I can only  attach 102k bytes at a time.

		you could either sort them alphbetically (A-G, H-M,...), or by their types (render/trans/misc or unknown...).<br />
<br />
However you do it, that way it'll be much easier to work through them and decide whether they are still common or already out to date.

		OK, this is my suggestion in order to get a decent ape-list-thread: <ul><li><b>Step 1:</b> post a list of all ape's here, so that we can decide which to leave out and (if possible) to collect the missing informations.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> start a new thread and post apes &amp; their corresponding information usig one post per ape, (this way you can download only the apes he really needs).</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> ask a mod to lock and sticky that thread. </li>
</ul><br />
ah... and pray that no one else posts in between when you create that thread:D

		Ok, so here's an alphabetical list of all the apes I have. But who's going to decide what to include and/or leave out? I'm sure there will be some differences of opinion, which will just make it MORE confusing (for me) to know what is or isn't supposed to be on the final list. I've already gathered as much info on each as is possible for me, so here's the list of all I have, let me know when you need something else or have made a final list of apes to be included. :|<br />

		beeferoni, do you have all information now (who made the ape, how is it called, what does it do...)?<br />
<br />
When you make that thread, you should add a hint to your first post, to inform people not to reply (when you're finished you can remove it again).<br />
<br />
Besides, i saw there are less than 40 ape's in that list, so they will still fit on one page if posted sperately!

		Ok first off, no I don't have all the info needed. Nothing has changed. How can I get information on an ape that I CAN'T see?<br />
(ifs.ape for instance) and eeltrens yes I know it is a widely used ape, but I don't know what it's called in the editor, I have looked many many times. <br />
<br />
If I have bitten off more than I can chew, I apologize for not knowing that. I will eventually get a list of some sort done I suppose, but without help it will still be incomplete, for reasons I already stated. I don't mean I just can't see ifs.ape, I mean it CRASHES my winamp right away, so there is NO way I can gather that info. I thank you all for the help already given, but...<br />
<br />
I will start again and get as much done as is POSSIBLE. I will start a new thread with the final list when I get done with it. ;)

If you do a simple google search for ifs.ape you will come up with three links to choose from. By selecting the last one, you will be taken <a href="http://vroom.itsdarkhere.com/~josh/code/alifeavs/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can download a small collection of apes, including ifs.ape (I know you already have it, but you may be able to override it and try again). It also had some screenshots of the ape to give a vague idea. Personally, I don't think it's even worth including but you may like to and if so, here's where you can find all the information on it.

		Thanks, TomyLobo,(I only got eeltrans through a downloaded pack, so I didn't get the txt file.) and denkensiefursic. (I did a search for ifs.ape but only on Yahoo. I hate Google, but I guess I should have tried it.) <br />
<br />
Ok, It won't take me as long as I thought to make the final. I am sorry I've been such a whiner through this. (Not to make excuses, but I am badly sick.) You're right, jheriko, if you look at the original post to this thread, it does look a little ridiculous. Let this be a lesson in humility to us all. :D<br />

I will get that new thread up ASAP

<br />
So please if you can give me the info you glommed from it. (or I will just leave the info out of ifs.ape)<br />
<br />
BTW, when I do the new thread, should I include the description in the post above the attatched zip, or should I include a txt file in the zips, or both?

		ok, cause the info is important to know what you are downloading actually. and provided that the 'user' of that upcoming service stores the ape-zips he dl's on his hd, he'll always be able to look up what a specific ape does.

Which is why, beeferoni, you should really reconsider including some of these apes. A lot of these outdated apes can and have already been recreated using standard AVS features.<br />
Tomy just gave a great example of this in comparison to ifs.ape. 3d.ape is pretty constricted. You can change the color, but besides that it's quite useless. Conway.ape could be created using the rand function, Tuggummi's &quot;Different Load&quot; comes to mind. Flame.ape, flock.ape, and fyrewurx.ape could all easily be created using different effects.<br />
I know it sounds discouraging, but don't listen to me; it's your thread and you can do what you want with it. ;)

		Thank you guys very much. I did finally get that site to come up (this comp is piece of shit), so I have all the info on that stuff. But still I appreciate it. :)<br />
<br />
Ok, a list of info I need:<br />
<br />
FrameRateLimiter.ape author<br />
<br />
triangle.ape author (I know it's someone I know well but I've forgotten!) <br />
<br />
tv.ape author<br />
<br />
vf2.ape  VisFrac works perfectly for me. But for some reason, VisFrac2 will not appear in a preset, although it's in the editor list. When i click it, nothing happens. Even when I removed visfrac1 from the avs folder, same problem. So any info on this will be needed. I assume it's the same author as the first, and basically the same as the first (except improved?) but I can't know for sure. <br />
<br />
vjcontrol.ape  author and description (I have not the foggiest notion what the hell this does!)<br />
<br />
and does anyone know which avi renderer needs the 'outgrab.dll' file to go with it? It came with it in the zip<br />
from the old crappy thread, but I have long since deleted the zip. So if nobody knows offhand, let me know and I will surf through that mess again to find it.<br />
<br />
That's all I need!!!<br />
We're almost done! :)

		So do you want us to leave out your apes, UnConeD? Damn that would almost make the whole list pointless. (You made a third of the apes I have!) How about if I officially asked for your permission here and included a disclaimer with each of your apes about not asking for technical support? Which I planned on doing anyway. Sorry if I presumed too much. I didn't see it as distributing, (I guess that's exactly what it is, though.) I see what you mean about idiots who would expect more than they should. :)

If nobody knows the other ones, I'll just leave out visfrac2; I'm sure it can't be much different from the first.  <br />
And tv.ape and 3d.ape just won't have authors listed. Still a pretty complete listing. I'll give this 1 or 2 more days before I start zipping files and make the new thread.

<br />
btw in which part of the AVS forum are you going to post it? Cause there already are <u>four</u> stickies in the main-forum..<br />
although i don't quite know where it should belong instead. perhaps into the wishlist, so that you can add new ones from time to time (eg. 'solution-apes' to problems posted in the wishlist or other usefull new stuff)?<br />

		I apologize, TomyLobo. My phone line has been kicking me off all f-ing day, so it was a miracle that the new thread wad posted before some joker replied, anyway. Otherwise I would have edited it. Hopefully they will go and check out your deviant site for the full info anyway (newbies who don't know you that is). As far as normalise, I just took what was out there. I forgot all about fluid by Geiss, also.<br />
<br />
There it just kicked me offline again. The fifth time in the last half hour. I guess I have to go next door and call the phone company. REALLY frustrating.:mad: :hang: :down:<br />
<br />
Anyway, how is this done? Do we just ask the moderators, 'please delete this thread' (and sticky the new one) or do they make those decisions in their own time, or what?

		well, the only way he could have avoided the post-pump would have been to post that thread in the recycle bin and ask a mod to move it back here again. but in the RB chances are much higher that someone posts in between!<br />
<br />
however... congrats on finishing that thread without any irritating replies and wasting all your time for this project!

		Well, almost. Someone (well known but not very active anymore on these boards)pm-ed me and wants his apes linked to. It's too late for me to do anything about it, isn't it?

		I dont want to sound like a negative nancy but:<br />
<br />
a) if you want to make a big list of APE's do it as a single post not lots of replies to a thread, preferably a big hyperlinked list of names, then a brief description of each afterwards<br />
b) a lot of those links are going to break after a short while, you can pretty much guarentee it

		Well actually PAK, there is a new thread now which is where I requested the changes to be made. I did them all as seperate posts, but a couple of the ape authors wanted some changes done. This thread was a mistake made by an inexperienced noob (that would be me):D and I hope the new thread is a little better. As far as links breaking, that is the imperfection of cyberspace. And I considered giving a link for every author (all but one has a deviant addy or their own site) but I didn't. In retrospect, I think I would have done that, but such is life I guess.<br />
(and no I dont think you sound negative at all. those are valid points.)

		hmm, i guess we were a bit overhasty on this project...<br />
<br />
but (like so often ;)) pak is right, if you only give links to the ape's pages you can do that in one single post. All that you would have to attach then were the few apes that don't have a site to dl them.

		Well, it's a question of one or the other I guess. Either you get a bunch of files with no link to them or you get a bunch of soon-to-be-broken links. But yeah, I suppose the latter may have been better. *sigh* :D

		i mean, if the link is broken, you'd know the name of the ape and who made it. So you'll probably be able to google for it yourself...

		c) if you attach the APE itself it will become out of date if and when the APE is updated by the author
