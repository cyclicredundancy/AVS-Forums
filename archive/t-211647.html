<div class="posttext">Lol, I realize most people don't care. But I got a hold of all the APEs that have been used for Winamp. Be warned, a lot of these may crash Winamp, and I understand that none of the old 3D APEs will work in Win XP. But as a historical oddity, if you are interested, reply here and I will zip them up for you. I would do it anyway, but there are a couple of dozen of them and some are quite big.:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ugh....there have already been many threads like these :confused: <br />
and anyway i guess all of us have the APE's that we need, expect that those &quot;newbies&quot; need them....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th March 2005, 07:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Right you are, Ishan. The one thread that lists all of the apes (before this) was very messy an long, full of broken links and defunct sites. I figured This would be a little cleaner, considering nobody is going to be asking for them anyway (much less than from a noob like me). :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th March 2005, 09:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">you're idea is surely generous and well-meant, but i guess a bit unnecessary. Cause as ishan said already the frequent people here have all required ape's. Of course, new people need them, but to be honest how many noobs came here in the past time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Your negative attitudes are all well and good.. but the old page is a pile of poo. It might be better to have a cleaner list. You'll appreciate it when you need to find a lot of apes for whatever reason. (reformat etc...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks, jheriko. Hm, but I'm thinking maybe I should just go ahead and zip up each APE individually and post them one at a time here. Or should I just go ahead and wait for someone to ask? (And all the time this thread is getting longer and messier...);)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th March 2005, 10:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well if you have to post the thread, the i'll suggest that you get this thread deleted by UCD, start a whole new thread with properly formatted post(s) contaning all the APE's (in zip files individually,coz i think that links can get broken somehow) with a short description of the APE, what it does, its maker and version no.<br />
Then get the thread locked and stickied by UCD again :)<br />
<br />
I guess that would be fair enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i think we shouldnt list narrow-purpose APEs<br />
also we shouldnt list outdated apes (like setlinewidth, sorry shreyas :))<br />
<br />
also we should restrict the number of APEs that dont enhance AVS's capabilities or speed for a particular purpose<br />
that would include these:<br />
RGB Filter: can be done easily with color modifier<br />
Screen Reverse: can be done with movement<br />
Negative Strobe: noone wants crappy strobe effects :P also, this can be easily done with color modifier</div></div><hr />

Obviously I listed 'narrow purpose' apes and ones already integrated into winamp. I am a newbie, so I don't remember all the apes that may have been around over the last few years. Also obviously, I am going to need help on this. I suggest we all list all the apes we can think of and then a couple of people will have to go back and clean up the list, and then finally any apes that are not actually owned by someone here will have to be searched out, or at least find out for sure if they exist anymore. (I had a bitch of a time finding tv.) Oh, and incidentally, my idea was to collect ALL the apes we can. Yes negative strobe looks crappy and is easily accomplished by other means, so are tv and conway for that matter. I thought the list should be more comprehensive than 'useful'. (I can't even get 'ifs.ape' to apply. It crashes my winamp every single time.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Aww, is that nice Tuggummi? I never said it was a 'good' or even a useful idea. I'm running it up the flagpole to see who salutes, that's all. Some people seem to find it an interesting enough idea to be discussing it. I'm sorry you don't feel the same. Gee, I hope everybody doesn't drop out now because the Great Tuggummi thinks it's stupid. :p (Tugg, I am still a fan.) I am the first to admit I'm noob, but I daresay even the best AVSer was once a newbie. Except maybe PAK-9 and UCD.:D<br />
<br />
Anyway...Yes, back to the topic at hand. Once I get the ones I missed I will go back and put them in alpha order (I had them that way, but I tried to list them in collums. Obviously it didn't work.

<div class="posttext">Damn it, I need more help than I thought. Please believe me, I started this, and I will do all of it if possible. But There are some apes I don't understand, and some that are called something different in the AVS editor. Like CLS Dynamic, I don't know what the editor calls it. And AVS grabber, I don't understand this one. It has to do with processing .avi and .avs files (perhaps converting or combining them?) Sorry, I'm a bonehead when it comes to video compression stuff. :(<br />
<br />
I will post the list as best as I can, and then UnConeD or someone else qualified can update the descriptions that I couldn't get. (It shouldn't be many):)<br />

See, these descriptions are a nightmare. I just have know way of obtaining some of the information . I was hoping someone else could just sort of 'fill in the blanks'. <br />
<br />
BTW, I see the downside of non-integrated apes now. I NEVER want to see another ape. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd suggest just to post ONE zip-file containing ALL ape's together with ONE list giving all background information. Or at the most do it in two posts to prevent the thread from getting broken/loading problems if it gets to huge. But 30 or so single posts are just too much (=confusing)!!<br />
<br />
eg do it like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
 name of apefile - name inside of AVS - short description and/or author<br />
<br />
 cls_dynamic.ape - Dynamic Clear Screen -  render ape that offers customizable settings... blablabla by shreyas_potnis<br />

<div class="posttext">OK, this is my suggestion in order to get a decent ape-list-thread: <br />
<br />
 Step 1: post a list of all ape's here, so that we can decide which to leave out and (if possible) to collect the missing informations.<br />
 Step 2: start a new thread and post apes &amp; their corresponding information usig one post per ape, (this way you can download only the apes he really needs).<br />
 Step 3: ask a mod to lock and sticky that thread. <br />
<br />
<br />
ah... and pray that no one else posts in between when you create that thread:D</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there will be some differences of opinion, which will just make it MORE confusing (for me) to know what is or isn't supposed to be on the final list.

<div class="posttext">beeferoni, do you have all information now (who made the ape, how is it called, what does it do...)?<br />
<br />
When you make that thread, you should add a hint to your first post, to inform people not to reply (when you're finished you can remove it again).<br />
<br />
Besides, i saw there are less than 40 ape's in that list, so they will still fit on one page if posted sperately!</div></div><hr />

(ifs.ape for instance) and eeltrens yes I know it is a widely used ape, but I don't know what it's called in the editor, I have looked many many times. <br />
<br />
If I have bitten off more than I can chew, I apologize for not knowing that. I will eventually get a list of some sort done I suppose, but without help it will still be incomplete, for reasons I already stated. I don't mean I just can't see ifs.ape, I mean it CRASHES my winamp right away, so there is NO way I can gather that info. I thank you all for the help already given, but...<br />

I will start again and get as much done as is POSSIBLE. I will start a new thread with the final list when I get done with it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do a simple google search for ifs.ape you will come up with three links to choose from. By selecting the last one, you will be taken here (http://vroom.itsdarkhere.com/~josh/code/alifeavs/). You can download a small collection of apes, including ifs.ape (I know you already have it, but you may be able to override it and try again). It also had some screenshots of the ape to give a vague idea. Personally, I don't think it's even worth including but you may like to and if so, here's where you can find all the information on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, It won't take me as long as I thought to make the final. I am sorry I've been such a whiner through this. (Not to make excuses, but I am badly sick.)

Which is why, beeferoni, you should really reconsider including some of these apes. A lot of these outdated apes can and have already been recreated using standard AVS features.<br />
Tomy just gave a great example of this in comparison to ifs.ape. 3d.ape is pretty constricted. You can change the color, but besides that it's quite useless. Conway.ape could be created using the rand function, Tuggummi's &quot;Different Load&quot; comes to mind. Flame.ape, flock.ape, and fyrewurx.ape could all easily be created using different effects.<br />
I know it sounds discouraging, but don't listen to me; it's your thread and you can do what you want with it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you guys very much. I did finally get that site to come up (this comp is piece of shit), so I have all the info on that stuff. But still I appreciate it. :)<br />
<br />
Ok, a list of info I need:<br />
<br />
FrameRateLimiter.ape author<br />
<br />
triangle.ape author (I know it's someone I know well but I've forgotten!) <br />
<br />
tv.ape author<br />
<br />
vf2.ape  VisFrac works perfectly for me. But for some reason, VisFrac2 will not appear in a preset, although it's in the editor list. When i click it, nothing happens. Even when I removed visfrac1 from the avs folder, same problem. So any info on this will be needed. I assume it's the same author as the first, and basically the same as the first (except improved?) but I can't know for sure. <br />
<br />
vjcontrol.ape  author and description (I have not the foggiest notion what the hell this does!)<br />
<br />
and does anyone know which avi renderer needs the 'outgrab.dll' file to go with it? It came with it in the zip<br />
from the old crappy thread, but I have long since deleted the zip. So if nobody knows offhand, let me know and I will surf through that mess again to find it.<br />
<br />
That's all I need!!!<br />
We're almost done! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ah, I should have known. Sorry, TomyLobo :D<br />
<br />
oh, and denkensiefursic this was origianlly not meant to be a resource of 'useful' or 'widely used' apes. It is just meant to be a resource of apes period. If you want, give me a list of apes which are definetly outmoded, and I will include it in the description as a caveat emptor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">as far as i remember correctly vjcontrol was made by unconed, but i didn't exactly understand how it works. it's for vj'ing purposes anyway.<br />
<br />
the other apes are completely unknown to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No permission was given for redistributing my APEs here. Poof.<br />
<br />
Wait until you have software you made spread out over a gazillion moronic sites all over the web, without the original disclaimers and no method of removing it. You'll just /love/ receiving mail about it 6 years afterwards from wankers who expect commercial-grade support from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th April 2005, 20:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So do you want us to leave out your apes, UnConeD? Damn that would almost make the whole list pointless. (You made a third of the apes I have!) How about if I officially asked for your permission here and included a disclaimer with each of your apes about not asking for technical support? Which I planned on doing anyway. Sorry if I presumed too much. I didn't see it as distributing, (I guess that's exactly what it is, though.) I see what you mean about idiots who would expect more than they should. :)</div></div><hr />

most of his apes are included in winamp anyway, so you dont need to upload them</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I couldn't find anything on it, but if it's for vj-ing (duh!)<br />
I guess that's enough to describe it somewhat. (?)<br />
<br />
If nobody knows the other ones, I'll just leave out visfrac2; I'm sure it can't be much different from the first.  <br />
And tv.ape and 3d.ape just won't have authors listed. Still a pretty complete listing. I'll give this 1 or 2 more days before I start zipping files and make the new thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thanks! i was just curios how it works but the example preset explains it pretty good.<br />
unfortunately i'm not a vj, but i guess it's quite fun, so hopefully i can use it some time (doesn't anybody need someone for vj'ing on a party or so?) ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I spent a little bit of time getting author names, but I guess If we want to avoid those authors getting mail about it (why anyone would expect support on 6 or even 3 year old software is beyond me) I will leave them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, I can do that, jheriko. You caught me just in time, I was zipping them now. :D<br />
<br />
And TomyLobo, Even though your apes will be in zips in the new thread, I will include a link to your deviant site, if that's all right. (Yes, I will spell it correctly!):D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, I will start the new thread in a couple of hours. Does anyone have any final advice? (Besides posting &quot;DO NOT REPLY TO THIS THREAD&quot;). I have all my files laid out nice and neat, everything accounted for, so it should go off without a hitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th April 2005, 21:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm, good luck!<br />
<br />
btw in which part of the AVS forum are you going to post it? Cause there already are four stickies in the main-forum..<br />
although i don't quite know where it should belong instead. perhaps into the wishlist, so that you can add new ones from time to time (eg. 'solution-apes' to problems posted in the wishlist or other usefull new stuff)?<br />
<br />
/edit: never mind we can still ask a mod to move it afterwards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">TomyLobo</div><div class="date small text-muted">7th April 2005, 23:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">heh you listed normalise.ape, that one is pretty useless :P<br />
i mainly use it for testing purposes<br />
<br />
<br />
filename: buffer.ape<br />
appears in: Misc. as 'Buffer blend'<br />
Allows you to blend buffers. Only blends absolute values (for now).<br />
Made by TomyLobo<br />
<br />
slightly wrong... use this:<br />
<br />
Allows you to blend buffers with each other or the current image. has all of the AVS blending modes except every other pixel/line and adjustable. additionally supports a new blending mode, absolute difference, which allows for some cool effects :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I apologize, TomyLobo. My phone line has been kicking me off all f-ing day, so it was a miracle that the new thread wad posted before some joker replied, anyway. Otherwise I would have edited it. Hopefully they will go and check out your deviant site for the full info anyway (newbies who don't know you that is). As far as normalise, I just took what was out there. I forgot all about fluid by Geiss, also.<br />
<br />
There it just kicked me offline again. The fifth time in the last half hour. I guess I have to go next door and call the phone company. REALLY frustrating.:mad: :hang: :down:<br />
<br />
Anyway, how is this done? Do we just ask the moderators, 'please delete this thread' (and sticky the new one) or do they make those decisions in their own time, or what?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that other thread is a bit of post-pumper and pretty dull with all those replies i think. anyways, w00t and nice work :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th April 2005, 13:01</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well, the only way he could have avoided the post-pump would have been to post that thread in the recycle bin and ask a mod to move it back here again. but in the RB chances are much higher that someone posts in between!<br />
<br />
however... congrats on finishing that thread without any irritating replies and wasting all your time for this project!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, almost. Someone (well known but not very active anymore on these boards)pm-ed me and wants his apes linked to. It's too late for me to do anything about it, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th April 2005, 04:19</div></div>

<div class="posttext">I have pm-ed a mod. Hopefully the changes I requested (about your buffer blend description, Tomy. and another minor change) will be made shortly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I dont want to sound like a negative nancy but:<br />
<br />
a) if you want to make a big list of APE's do it as a single post not lots of replies to a thread, preferably a big hyperlinked list of names, then a brief description of each afterwards<br />
b) a lot of those links are going to break after a short while, you can pretty much guarentee it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th April 2005, 07:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well actually PAK, there is a new thread now which is where I requested the changes to be made. I did them all as seperate posts, but a couple of the ape authors wanted some changes done. This thread was a mistake made by an inexperienced noob (that would be me):D and I hope the new thread is a little better. As far as links breaking, that is the imperfection of cyberspace. And I considered giving a link for every author (all but one has a deviant addy or their own site) but I didn't. In retrospect, I think I would have done that, but such is life I guess.<br />
(and no I dont think you sound negative at all. those are valid points.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th April 2005, 11:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm, i guess we were a bit overhasty on this project...<br />
<br />
but (like so often ;)) pak is right, if you only give links to the ape's pages you can do that in one single post. All that you would have to attach then were the few apes that don't have a site to dl them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th April 2005, 16:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, it's a question of one or the other I guess. Either you get a bunch of files with no link to them or you get a bunch of soon-to-be-broken links. But yeah, I suppose the latter may have been better. *sigh* :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">9th April 2005, 17:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i mean, if the link is broken, you'd know the name of the ape and who made it. So you'll probably be able to google for it yourself...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">c) if you attach the APE itself it will become out of date if and when the APE is updated by the author</div></div><hr />
