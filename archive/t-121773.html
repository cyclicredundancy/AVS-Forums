      <p class="post-content">avs itself can not be used as a screen saver. There are two things that you could do to make it appear this way.<br />
      1. Just hit the fullscreen button.(recommended)<br />
      2. Figure out the sourcecode for AVS and write your own screensaver using it.(HAHAHA)<br />
      <br />
      I guess you could use one of the video saving APE's and save some AVS clippage to a video file and use a program that will convert this to a screensaver. However it would be the same everytime and wouldn't react to the music.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fullscreen- it's so damn obvious :D<br />
      plus, you'll get some music too :D<br />
      - now really, screensavers so complex as winamp vizualizations i couldn't imagine anyone working so much for such a product with a, guaranteed reduced, small spread area among computerusers.<br />
      so search a more interesting screensaver that resembles somehow to an avs ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">One thing has baffled me for ages. Why the heck do people have these incredibly complex screensavers active? I thought when a screensaver was active, you WEREN'T sitting behind your desk :P.<br />
      <br />
      I guess it's one of those "oh lookit my pc makes funny images while I'm away, I must be really smart!" things.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't even have a screensaver active. If I did, I would use one of the ones that tries to find the cure for cancer or something - even though there is an infintesimal(sp) chance of it finding it. At least then my computer would be doing something. I will leave AVS running fullscreen a lot though, if I happen to be near the computer.</p>
