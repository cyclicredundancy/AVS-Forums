<div class="posttext">Searched the forums but couldn't find an answer---<br />
<br />
Is it possible to deactivate the screen saver/power save options when AVS is running full screen? Its just annoying that it goes off every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Ryan</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Why not just disable the screensaver alltogether? :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">with other words: no it is not possible to only disable suspend-mode and screensaver when avs is in fullscreen. Sorry.<br />
<br />
But i also recommend you to deactivate the whole screensaver and power-mode stuff. Avs works pretty well as my default 'screensaver'! ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh well. I definitely have some programs that disable the screen saver (windows media player) while they're running. Maybe this is a feature that can be implemented in an updated version?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">why use screen saver and monitor auto off anyway? screen saver just consumes system power, and you can turn off your monitor if you leave the computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i think auto power off is useful if configured right.<br />
it's not like we're on win3x where you're sometimes interrupted while working ^^<br />
<br />
i should have turned it on on my old computer earlier, before the monitor got too dark to see anything ^^ i regularly forgot to turn it off. sometimes i even left it on for whole weekends :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You guys are nerds.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you why you should AVS as a screen saver:  Because it looks cool!  I've always thought that a AVS-screen saver would be a great idea, as many screen savers aren't quite as visually appealing as some AVS presets are.  Perhaps this could be added with the open source project?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">/me agrees with nemo<br />
<br />
again instead of providing a simple answer you point to things the user is not interested in. would be nice indeed to have this feature, so if a user still *wants* to enable/disable a screensaver he don't has to go through the annoying procedure whenever using avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's kinda funny how people always say not to use a screensaver seeing is that they're not needed no longer.<br />
When really, the point of a screensaver nowadays, is so that when not doing something on the computer, there's something interesting to look at than a boring desktop, or so that when not in use, you don't have to see the desktop period. Or maybe even so that when a person is sleeping, and their computer is in their room, the monitor may end up not producing so much lite if any at all.<br />
I don't like my monitors to actually turn off, nor do I really use a screensaver, my comps are set to show a BLANK screen, so that when not in use, it looks off.<br />
So yeah, it really would be handy if AVS disabled the screensaver or monitor off functions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One issue though..<br />
- Screen savers are only used to have something to look at while your pc is in powersave mode. (that's the whole idea, right?)<br />
- AVS uses 100% of your CPU (as it is now), and I don't have to explain that that's not a way to save power..</div></div><hr />

there's might be exceptions, but when my (blank) screensaver is running, i usually don't listen to music. however, i can imagine a lot of people would find out that avs existed when they saw it running as screensaver ;)<br />
<br />
well, to go even more off-topic, it would be nice to see avs supported by various players and stuff. from what i read from the official winamp guys, they don't fancy the idea. but that's because avs profits from it and not winamp.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the fact that screensavers are useless... who the heck wants to have pretty stuff on their screen when they're not there to watch it? :P<br />
I guess it's one of those things for in the workplace, so fellow collegues can 'oooooh' and 'aaaah' at your l33t screensaver downloading skills :p.<br />
<br />
Just use powersave mode if you really want to save your screen... <br />
<br />
<br />

Just had to quote this since it sums up nicely what i wanted to say, only better ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would also like the ability to disable the power save features during playback.  I am currently using an LCD TV as my monitor and speakers, and if the power save kicks in, the sound goes away, too.  Not a big problem, since I can just set up my real speaker system after I move again, but it is kind of annoying in this temporary setup.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There might be a plugin to supend the powersave mode while playing music (regardless the visualization being on or off). Try asking in the Winamp Tech support (not the AVS troubleshooting) forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can nudge the mouse with some simple code to prevent this stuff... I did have an Excel spreadsheet that did the job.<br />
<br />
The key is using the GetCursorPos and SetCursorPos API calls to nudge it by one pixel then move it immediately back.<br />

<br />
This might be a bit difficult for the non-programmer, but this is a 10 minute code job with VB/VBA/.NET etc if you are familiar with how to setup API calls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">let me mention this just once: avs already turns off the screensaver when running in fullscreen. thought it has to do with the winamp video options, but it doesn't.<br />
