<div class="posttext">What is your dream AVS, that you could never build but want to!<br />
<br />
Mine is a moving and working copy of the Lament Configuration from Hellraiser, Made of Superscopes. I wish itd move and transform like that cube could, Oh the Awesomeness! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My dream avs...<br />
Now let's see...<br />
<br />
I would like to use multiple presets in one single avs preset without a mass framerate loss and able to switch between them randomly by fading in&amp;out, if this fading effect could be configured with a dm it would totally kick ass.<br />
<br />
That's my dream...</div></div><hr />

Wireframes are all I needed...<br />

But backing off the hoping scale a bit, a pontifex/bridgebuilder preset will work pretty nicely on me...<br />

Backing off more : Mr. Happy doing breakdancing moves =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pontifex is a game where you build bridges out of framework constructions. The simulation is very realistic and with practice you can make some really awesome things :).<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is that the levels in it are always geared toward one solution and often don't give you enough freedom to try out some new things. But it's pretty powerful and with patience you can do awesome things :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Except pontifex2 is more fun. I made a bridge with a hole in it once. The train fell through the hole, hit the boat, the boat slowly tipped and went sideways, then the boat hit the support of the bridge, then BOOM the bridge collapses :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My dream AVS preset would be one with a huge subwoofer vibrating along the music :) Some circle scopes could do a 3d rotation around it and change the color of the subwoofer...Antialiasing is a must have in this preset ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Subwoofers have been modelled before.  Nothing great that I've seen, though.  The Winamp3 skin MMD3 has a nice subwoofer vis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Fractals have been done before with a Dynamic Movment: UnConeD'sWhacko AVS I (http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=68383) and Atero'sThe Forward Flow 2 (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1050849)<br />
<br />
Also, VisFrac (http://forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?postid=748901 ) , an APE for can do fractals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th February 2003, 01:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, but there are many more fractals to be done.  These have just been the mandelbrot and julia sets(I believe this is it, no?).  There are many more interesting fractals that have yet to be implemented in AVS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th February 2003, 03:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">AVS-King did powerswitching Julia (At least what I think it is - Gemstone, Focus II), Double Julia, Queen of Hearts, Sierpinski, Sierpinski-carpet-ish fractal (Which squares between the 9 squares in division to be blackened out randomized every beat). (He's a most-time fractal artist, don't blame him)<br />
<br />
El-Vis did Dragon IFS, SSC-Rendered Julia.<br />
<br />
Atero did SSC-Rendered Julia (With Fractal-program style coloring...), Leaf IFS, and word IFS.<br />
<br />
There are others, but g2g (Dammit)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, I forgot about AVS-king. I haven't looked at his stuff in a long time.  <br />
Another preset I would like to see is a morphing crop-circles preset with 3-D cropcircles(camera moves around the morphing crop circles kinda like a helicopter and zooms in and out on crop-circles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Scanning fractals aren't really that hard to do, they're just slow as f*** if you want any decent quality...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's a quick crop circles thingy... the patterns aren't too special, but you can code your own scopes for it.<br />
<br />
Noise plus vertical convolution ops is used to fake grain stalks.<br />
<br />
I guess it would look cooler with interlacing, noise and bad-tv-like bands to enhance the X-Files-factor :cool:.</div></div><hr />

That would be cool in avs only if it would be possible to view it with a decent framerate in atleast 800x600... I guess we will have to wait for that day a loong time :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not like rabbit hole because I want more obvious and faster turns, thats what I meant with that tubular deformation thing. Damn I cant find a way to tell you what I mean. <br />
<br />
If you  had a curve in the midlle of the tunnel made out of circles,<br />
all the circles would be perpendicular to the curve in the middle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Monkey? havent seen that one.</div></div><hr />
