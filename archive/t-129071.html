<div class="posttext">From the looks of the this forums, I think we need an active mod - And I mean, very active...<br />
<br />
For now, vote on people who you'd like to see as a mod (of this forums).<br />
People who got voted but does not want to be a mod can back out.<br />
<br />
And please, use common sense when voting for a mod...<br />
<br />
...And for wannabe mods - We need active and non-power-mad mods, and hopefully friendly...<br />
<br />
Hopefully an admin gets a look at this topic once it's done, if it gets done..<br />
<br />
P.S. : Don't vote me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well Fickle, Rovastar doesn't seem to be around much here anymore.  He comes around every couple of days, but barely ever posts here.  I believe he is still &quot;active&quot; over in the milkdrop forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the traitor.<br />
<br />
and no, i wouldn't ban all the noobs, just legohead and maybe a couple others.  probably you too, at some point ;) that and half the new threads would be closed in two days or less.<br />
<br />
i WOULD nominate unconed (CONEMOD!), for the simple reason of he's got a level head, but if he's too busy for AVS he's too busy to mod - that and he's only around here once a week.  i actually would vote for nic too, for the same reason...but he's hardly ever around (tho it'd be a good excuse for him to use the computer...right? ;) ).  then i think it's pretty much down to me, anubis, and tuggummi...see above :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 05:20</div></div>

<div class="posttext">So you would ban me, but you want me as mod?  Hmmm.:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, you serious?<br />
<br />
I can't be even if someone votes me. Im not on a very stable connection here and i only visit the forums from school... the fact that school is basicly 8 hours sitting in front of the computer seems irrelevant to me :p<br />
<br />
<br />
I vote for Anubis, i think he knows a lot about avs, is friendly and uses the avs forums a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for Fickle: Well hardly any leader will &quot;step aside&quot; by their own will, what we need is a rebellion! Burn Rovastar!     j/k! :p</div></div><hr />

it's almost a no-brainer, unconed knows a lot, is friendly can explain things good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">DO NOT make atero moderator ! Its like giving Saddam 50 nukes...Unconed is smart and friendly so i`ll go with this option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Does UnConeD make presets anymore? Yes, he has made a few singles.<br />
<br />
Does UnConeD post at the forums anymore? Yes, on the most technical questions usually.<br />
<br />
Does he have the time for being a moderator? My assumption is NO, i also believe that it was one of the reasons he quit doing avs, not enough time.<br />
<br />
You might want to respect that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I would go for anubis. UnConeD probably doesn't have the time required and Atero can get a bit angry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Atero has flame wars, not mod material<br />
UnConeD would be just like Rovastar, never here<br />
Nic01 not here that much, and didnt you guys see the &quot;dont vote me&quot;, that means he dosent want to.<br />
Anubis knows a lot is friendly etc, he hasnt exactly been here long though.<br />
<br />
Ill let someone with more credibility decide</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1) i AM around a lot, i visit the forum about twice a day<br />
2) the only flame wars i've had that i can think of are ones with visag, legohead, and gourmet - and those were months ago.<br />
and i think i'd be doing about the same job as anubis or tuggummi would, which is why i said me/anubis/tuggummi (add raz to that, forgot you before).<br />
<br />
and to anyone who thinks i can get pissy, FUCK YOU :mad:</div></div><hr />

That's kinda contradicting Atero.:p   <br />
<br />
I would agree with Atero that he doesn't get into flame wars often, but he does come close pretty often.  I know he pissed me off when I first came on these forums.  He is very helpful when you gain his respect, and will tell anyone what they are doing wrong.  He would make a half decent mod.  Tugg would also make a good mod except that he isn't on these forums quite as often and can't choose an avatar and stick with it.:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the reason rovastar isnt around much is because he dosent have  a stable connection to the internet right now<br />
<br />
hes looking for a new place to live {i think} and he should be around more often soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th March 2003, 23:07</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ahh, now it makes sense, we could do with a temporary mod or something for the timebeing though, he'sposted all of what, 3 times in the last few weeks or something similar. Jesus im on a possible mod list, meh not me, there are too many more superior people for that job. I suppose you havent been pissing people off lately atero, sorry didnt notice. Theres a good few that could fit the job but Rovastar will be back soon we hope so its not really worth discussing and reading my pointless post was a waste of time but i already wrote it so i might as well post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Anubis or Atero.<br />
<br />
this is slightly off topic, but we ALSO need more AVS reviewers.<br />
IMO, we should kick Doggy Dog, because he is never in the AVS forums, and replace him with somebody who is very AVS literate.<br />
<br />
I would nominate Raz for this, he is very good at reviewing (although he couldn't give big ass reviews for everybody) and somebody else, like Anubis or Tuggummi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st March 2003, 00:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Raz : I'm here everyday except on special occasions, which is very, very rare indeed.<br />
...And even then, I'm usually only available from 14:45-(18:00-21:00 - Varies often, rarely gets up to 21:00) my time...<br />
<br />
Anubis : Naw, it's just because of constant flow of newbies and a certain group of people changing the topic a good amount of the time...<br />
<br />
Michaelthecat : True, we need someone who actually is up-to-date with the recent happenings and knows the current standards.<br />
<br />
Now, if this topic descends into pointless flaming (Which it partially got to) and indecisive end, I might run for the modding job too...<br />
<br />
P.S. : That doesn't mean spamming or changing the topic deliberately.</div></div><hr />

Votes :<br />
<br />
Atero - 2 (indecisive - 2)<br />
Anubis - 2 (indecisive - 2)<br />
Raz - Nomination, but no votes yet.<br />
Tuggummi - 1 (indecisive)<br />
<br />
Right now the (temporary) (Permanent if deserved) new AVS mod position can go to anyone, Atero and Anubis in the lead...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok im sticking with this one i originally made only for devart...<br />
<br />
And i don't want any bitching about my face or i will make it my personal crusade that you guys will see a new tuggummi avatar every week! :mad:<br />
<br />
And as for the new mod/reviewer , i would gladly take either one of those positions, because i am quite active (imho) although i don't have internet @ home.<br />
<br />
But carry on :)<br />
<br />
<br />
That is if someone even votes me :) To be honest i would love to be a reviewer, but not a mod that much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Jegohead...I'd only ban you if you continue to show your incompetence :) Right now you're okay - if you go back to how you were when you first came here, you can kiss your fkn ass goodbye :)<br />
<br />
I've been interested in an AVS reviewing position for a long time...I never review much here cos it takes a while and usually other people have said what I wanna say, but I'd be glad to do some staff reviews.  As for modding...I stick to what I said before - UnConeD, then Nic, then me/tug/anubis/raz.  (Tho I think I'm leaning towards me and/or tug cos we've been here for a while...)<br />
And hey...I'm getting votes ^_^ j4j</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i doubt i'd be a decent candidate for a mod because like i said, more superior candidates but as an avs reviewer i wouldnt mind, i dont mind reviewing things and i dont have to make big ass reviews, i just choose to because people put the time in to make the presets, i dont mind putting the time in to give them feedback and some tips on how to improve. plus packs always take a long time to come through it cant be bad to have another reviewer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st March 2003, 20:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I would like to be a reviewer or mod.  I think that it is basically between me, tugg, and atero, since everyone else is saying(only partially for Raz) that they don't want to do it.  And UnConeD would be the best, but I don't know if he has the time.<br />
<br />
I will be gone for the next couple of days.  My sister has a stupid cheerleading thing in Myrtle Beach, and I can't get out of it.  I'm going to be confined to a hotel room down there for 2 days, so I'll be gone 'til sunday night/monday.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">haha...lets pray for anubis to screw a cheerleader :D Now its time to be serious, Tugg is the best choice : he is helpful , not gay( :) j/k ) , visits pretty often the forums and most important, he is NICE.<br />

<div class="posttext">I think that Nic01 would be just the guy for this &quot;job&quot;. Unlike Anubis he has been quite long in the community and has more experience I guess.. Tuggummi would be also good, but have you thought that when the summer holidays starts from him, he isn't able to come by to the forums very often..<br />
<br />
 seems like Nic doesn't want to be voted, but my vote goes to him anyway :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you can't force someone to be a mod. I f they dont want to, they wont. Tuggummi would be good for the job and anyone who can spell and is interested in avs and isnt too harsh would be good for a reveiwer, its just a case of choosing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes killahbite said it! I could be a mod together with rovastar, but me alone would be too much for me :P<br />
<br />
Also i think if rovastar isn't that active then why not select two new mods to assist him? Then there would be like Rovastar as the head man and two underlings :D<br />
<br />
And degnic you are right about the summer thing... Maybe im not such a good canditate afterall.</div></div><hr />

In a DEMOCRATIC Forum, the majority rules.<br />
If we'd had ANARCHY, evryone could do everything without asking others.<br />

Oh, and the cheerleading camp was all 1st-7th graders - not quite my age group, and I am no petafile.  There were some car shows down there, so there were some hot cars all over the place - Plymouth Prowlers, BMW Z4's, Corvettes, and plenty of sweet imports and 40s hot rods.  The highlight of my trip was seeing a Shelby Cobra in a parking lot.  That is one of my favorite cars.<br />

<div class="posttext">Actually Im retracting this statement and personal mailing this to Atero (the way bitchy comments should be handled for anyone who cares). Im ashamed that I've had to 'speak the native tongue' to get my point across - but thats the only language the natives seem to listen to.<br />
If there is one good thing that has come out of my last flame session - is that I haven't heard much of a peep out of Atero when it comes to needless shin kicking (until now that is).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">n00bs have to earn respect before they should be treated with respect.  When they come and ask stupid questions like &quot;Why does AVS keep changing?&quot; they completely throw away any respect that one could have for them.  Although Atero(please don't be flaming him) is a little too harsh, they deserve some hard words.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OMG... this forum then is starting to sound like the mafia and not 'enthusiasts'.<br />
I believe there's a simple solution. Start up another website where you can have your 'ELITE?' group instead of the one NULLSOFT have put together so that ALL users can ask questions and SHARE information FREELY.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">legohead: you make some good points but calm down. If you're going to argue please keep the flaming to a minimum. You make some good points but its all padded with pointless filler. Firstly, 14 is not prepubescent, atero has more respect around here than you do so don't resort to pointless insults on someones age. You seem to use redundant &quot;big words&quot; to make your argument seem more worthwhile and banning someone over using a word is yet another pointless result of your anger over nothing. The &quot;arsetero&quot; sums it all up. All atero has said really is that you were bad when you were new but you are not now. Is that good reason for your verging on flaming post? no, i didnt think so. Please calm yourself down before posting arguments again ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd March 2003, 22:54</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Also, Nullsoft has created these forums to be a place for people to come and find answers to questions.  People posting questions that have already been answered helps nobody and only angers the regulars.  ALL People are FREELY allowed to come here and recieve any information that they need(within the forum rules), but they must show a willingness to do there own part before they can expect everyone else to do theirs.  If they don't even do a simple search of the forums, they should not expect anyone to answer a question that has already been asked countless times before.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, what exactly are we going to do here in terms of moderators and reviewers.  All this thread is doing is starting a flame war and saying that we want a moderator.  We need to actually see if anything can be done about the moderator/reviewer positions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well Arsetero, looks like you've picked up some nice political pointers from the sandbox at your kindy - I certainly hope your mommy doesn't hear you say those words. Leave your prepubescent drivel elsewhere please.<br />
If you start treating people - anyone, including me - like that in this forum, you will get banned eventually, no matter who the mod is.  In case you haven't noticed, I'm one of the most knowledgable users here and you are, well, not.  Seeing as how you're not exactly do much for this community it wouldn't be a very great loss to get rid of you.  I've yet to see you post one preset here, in fact.<br />

For the reasons I just stated, I must say that you really don't belong here in the first place, so you shouldn't be making judgements on the &quot;elite&quot; group of users who actually CONTRIBUTE to this board.  What information have YOU shared on this forum?  What have YOU done?  If you hate us so much, then GO START YOUR OWN DAMN FORUM.<br />

<div class="posttext">Ahh.  Those PM's that I never check because I never use them.<br />
<br />
Just wondering:<br />
By the way (just becuase I know where this would've ended up) I don't care what you &quot;mean&quot; by your earlier phrase - because it &quot;communicates&quot; hostility where its not wanted or needed. you need to learn how to talk to people with respect - that includes &quot;n00bs&quot; - which, by the way I'd ban you for even using the term. And I don't want another boring flaming contest consisting of your mild, bland rebuttle.&lt; emphasis on the stop there...<br />
Does this look like mod material to ANYONE?  (refferring to the &quot;i'd ban you&quot; statement)<br />
Furthermore:<br />
I come here for information - not insults from a 14 y/o who obviously hasn't been taught respect. <br />
I thought you may have changed since our last conflict. Obviously your fear of retaliation has worn off and Im in no mood for anymore b/s. <br />
I have posted your comments to the current moderator. Im sure it will do nothing but I don't really care. You will eventually destroy this forum in which you seem to delight in being 'popular' in. With the forum gone nullsoft have no way of tracking users/developers. Without that they'll kill the progam. And where will that leave you? <br />
<br />
By all means continue.<br />
Does this look like MEMBER material to anyone?<br />
<br />
I reiterate: eat shit and die, cunt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero: you made some good points also but you ruined it with your pointless flaming. You may be well respected but flaming from anyone just isn't tolerated. Calm down before you post. Oh and by the way people please dont use sarcasm on a message board, it just dosent work in text form.<br />
<br />
Legohead: you've given up and resorted to putting down something that was justified. Most of Atero's post was justified. Just leave it now, we've established that atero can be annoying and he is respected. And we've established that legohead established that atero can be annoying. We've also established that legohead has not contributed much. Lets just leave it be and move on.<br />

<div class="posttext">I nominate myself, but my vote goes to Raz.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to the, umm, secondary topic.<br />
<br />
As far as I see it (and as we know), Atero do flames... appropriately, ironically...<br />
Atero never really do &quot;needless shin kicking&quot; - It's like a police : violent at the right times (Not counting drunk ones). And yes, I know, Atero is a bit more violent than that, but he knows when to be that way.<br />
<br />
Reminder to self : Watch legohead a bit more closely than others *if* I become mod - I'm guessing this will not be the last of his flaming.<br />
<br />
Now, as the topic starter (and prolly me partial duty to keep this topic on topic), I say : STOP THE GODDAMNED FLAMING DAMMIT.<br />
<br />
There.</div></div><hr />

not quite, you have to read tons of post , to be hated by other people because you are moderator , to ban ppl that will hate you forever and to make decisions that can get you many enemies. :) <br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Sorry I have not been around much folks.<br />
<br />
But the question of Mods is what needs moding. Moving unsuitabel threads to the correct location banning people who are out of order.<br />
<br />
The banning thing is that I have only banned 2 people in 2 years or something and one of them was in these forums. (I think only 1 of these is a perm ban) for attacking our very own neo-nazi virus writer. :)<br />
<br />
I try and read most of teh posts but life has been maniac for teh last couple of months. Hell often I am paying to use Internet cafes PC's to keep an eye on the forums. That's deadication for you. :)<br />
<br />
I do move posts around sometimes. More often from other forums (GD, WA TS) to here. And if anything needs doing then post uses the report to mod button I responsd to that. :)<br />
<br />
Being good a TS does not make you a good mod. You want me to correct soem peopel presets to prove my worth :-) I once remeber otimising soem of UnConeD's :)<br />
<br />
MOst of my work for these forums has been backstage. You wouyld not beleive the hassle to get the AVS review team set up and to get other things moving.<br />
<br />
I personally do not think another mod is needed at the moment. Let alone who it will be. :) UnConed would have been great but he stated a long tiime ago that he does not want this. If he had the desired I could have worked hard to make him one - which would be a battle by itself to have another mod!<br />
<br />
But this thread has proved there are people UNSUITABLE for mod-dom. :)<br />
<br />
Oh stop the flames peopel. :) I thought they're might have been flaming towards me but it internal. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey, look.  It's Rovastar.:p   Good to see you again.  I am going to say something real quick, though.  I think this thread does show a need for another mod.  There was a pretty harsh flame war going on, and it took some time for a mod to notice it(or at least to make it known that they noticed it).  I still think that a second mod could help a lot.</div></div><hr />
