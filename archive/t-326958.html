      Although I love to see the progress in AVS, the different versions will undoubtedly give compatibility issues with our audience.<br />
      <br />
      That's why I think we should best choose a 'best' version and work with that as much as we can to prevent this from now on. Am I right?<br />
      <br />
      I added a poll, please click the version you'd like to work with from now on and please add why.<br />
      <br />
      (I left out 2.82 and 2.83 for obvious reasons)</p>

      <p class="post-content">that was the last version i managed to build which didn't bomb out - source code is around somewhere for it.<br />
      <br />
      and i still hold that having AVS forked as has now happened doesn't help things out at all but whatever.<br />
