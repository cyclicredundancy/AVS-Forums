			<strong>AVS display blank</strong><br />
		
		

		When I select AVS it gives me a blank screen Winamp doesn't crash AVS just doesn't show anything, Milkdrop works fine. I had this problem on my old laptop and my friend's laptop has this problem, but the one this I don't get is when I was in high school AVS worked fine and Milkdrop showed nothing. I don't know why because my old laptop and my new laptop are completely superior in every single way possible, so hardware is not the problem. I download wimamp yesterday so it is the latest version of AVS.

		AVS is old and not all presets as well as AVS itself work correctly on newer OSes. have a look at the 2.91 test builds to see if that helps out (though AVS is never likely to work properly compared to how it did on XP even with the newer builds which may help - mileage will vary).<br />

		That would have been my next guess to why it didn't work.
