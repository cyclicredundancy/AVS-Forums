      <p class="post-content">I had already seen most of them, but still, nice work.<br />
      I liked The Speed of Dark best.<br />

      <p class="post-content">darkshines, i love the effect. very nice preset and the use of the chrome is stellar<br />
      speed of dark, hmm, it's very smooth and nicely done but it just doesn't click with me for some reason, i think it's the oversaturation of the yathosho-style patterns, love the ring tho.<br />
      vapour trail, whoa trippy shit, very nice, the darkish border however, don't like it. altho that's easy fixable</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with montana about Darkshines. It's a lovely preset.<br />
      <br />
      Shock does look unfinished, but it's still quite nice. The coloured bits (can't express myself correctly) look just a tad too jerky. Speed of Dark is also very good. Maybe a bit cluttered, but... maybe not. Don't like Vapour Trail as much as I should I guess, but it's still a nice preset. Wireframe X... great use of C.F., and it's amusing enough.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice presets, people said it before.<br />
      i don't like darkshines so much like the others, it's a bit too colormappy for me, if you know what i mean. a good preset still!<br />
      shock is nice, the bg could be more agressive in color imo.<br />
      speed of dark: droolÂ³! :D great!<br />
      vapour trail has better colors now. i made a remix, a bit far from the original, but hey!<br />
