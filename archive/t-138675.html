<div class="posttext">I had a superscope in this preset that wasn't behaving:p so I took it out and there was still a decent image on the screen.  I touched it up and this is what I got.  I think it's pretty cool, but any advice would be helpful :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Wow, another renderless preset, why restrict yourself by disallowing yourself from using certain effects? This is a quite nice contour type effect, very sloppy though, a fadeout set to 0 and a movement with none selected. I like the colour shine though, make the colours change and add a flow type DM to the contours to make them more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay I fixed that up.  The DM is still in progress, but now I have a question.  I cycled the colors on colormap from blue -&gt; red -&gt; green.  It's normal when it goes from blue to red, but when it turns green it &quot;strobes.&quot;  Does anyone know why that happens?</div></div><hr />

don't pay any attention to that....just typing useless random incorrect code for no reason....just bored I guess.  Hey, what do you know?  It's 4:11 am and I desperately need sleep.  Goodnight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think it's the delaying of the invert.  When you first enable it, it flashes, and then it kind of tones down a bit.  When the colormap switches to green, that's when the invert changes.  Laying the invert outside of the effect list will fix this, but your designs on the screen will be altered, so that sucks.<br />
<br />
But if you don't switch it to green at all, this problem never occurs.  Why, I'm not sure, maybe the effect can only handle a certain amount of colors....<br />
<br />
Maybe someone who knows for sure should post here, I want to know too.  This problem has happened to me a couple times as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought that as long as you posted this thread i might as well upload a renderless preset using a bump.With a mirror movement and 2 channel shifts and buffer saves i made 2 bumps from 1 and they look like worms.Its quite incomplete but it looks nice.You can get some sucky plasma effect if you use a movement with x=x/4 and y=y/4(rect. coordinates enabled). :D  Any IDEAS are welcomed.<br />
<br />
Pixelcraft : i liked the first one more...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">[21:55] &lt;Nic01&gt; Invert just takes the input and inverts it<br />
[21:58] &lt;Nic01&gt; Because you don't have the clear every frame on. It inverts, output goes back into input, gets inverted again, etc<br />

STRAIGHT FROM #finnish-flash ESPECIALLY FOR Kagnar :D<br />
-my explanation sucked and it was kinda wrong-</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Kagnar: if you have a problem with a preset, dissect it until you figure it out. Set the colormap to adjustable so you can fade between the input and the output. The input constantly flashes between inverted and regular.<br />
Because your first two colormaps (blue and red) have black at BOTH ends, both white and black end up the same, and the grays are somewhat symmetrical. Only the green map is different. In fact, if you make your colormap perfectly symmetrical, it will remove the flashing altogether (except for the bump, which is not inverted with the rest). You can use the 'set position' feature of colormap 1.2 to do this. For a point at position X, create an identical point at 255-X.</div></div><hr />
