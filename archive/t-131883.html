<div class="posttext">Hey!<br />
<br />
I've recently released my first preset pack... Until it's added to the winamp.com presets database you can get it from the downloads area of http://www.geekwurkz.tk.  I'm relatively new to AVS so any speed improvements would be welcome... Considering they were designed on an 300 MHz AMD K6-2 proc, they're rather optimised already so I could get half decent framerates.<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
<br />
BTW... Please excuse the installer, It's my first installer made with NSIS and it's designed to install the presets to the winamp 2 path only.<br />
<br />
BTWx2... Please tell me what you think of them as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You made shareware AVS Presets I have never seen that before. Here is my review of your presets.<br />
<br />
01-intro - Ugly,repetitive and barely music responsive.<br />
<br />
02-Black Hole - Kind of ugly.<br />
<br />
03-Bubbles - Very simple and it could be more music responsive.<br />
<br />
04-Burning sun - Kinda ugly.<br />
<br />
05-Channel - Doesn't look very nice.<br />
<br />
06-Driving - Very simple.<br />
<br />
07-Enter the Wormhole - Not music responsive.<br />
<br />
08-Meteorite - This is very simple.<br />
<br />
09-Nauesa - Ugly and simple.<br />
<br />
10-NoTA-logo - Not very nice also slightly boring.<br />
<br />
11-Pastel Firewurx - Simple.<br />
<br />
12-Plasma Globe - Not very interesting.<br />
<br />
13-Pulse - Don't like this one.<br />
<br />
14-Spiral - Ugly.<br />
<br />
A lot of these presets are simple but at least you used some superscopes and Dynamic Movements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, I might as well put the full version up for review here...  It's got one preset that is supposed to be unbeliveably simple, you'll know it when you see it. It's at http://www.geekwurkz.tk/downloads/setup.exe</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pretty newbie presets...work some more and try to understand movements and the greatest tool,the superscope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">SHAREWARE AVS? WTF?!<br />
<br />
Please don't do that... Many of us (more like all) do presets for FREE just because we like doing AVS presets. We give away free code that others can use as well in their own presets considering that we give credit where credit is due.<br />
<br />
But to charge money from AVS PRESETS? That is out of the question at least for me! It's not moraly right to charge money from something others can do themselves as well. Besides AVS presets are &quot;soft coded&quot; add-on's to a hard coded plugin, they need the actual avs system to run. I know that wa plugins need the actual winamp to run, but for AVS? You need 2 &quot;separate&quot; (while avs comes with winamp, it's still a separate component) softwares to get the damn thing to work, first winamp and then avs on top of it, and after that the actual avs presets!<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this kinda thing is unaccetable and just makes me :mad: We do them for free and you charge money from it! Also to tell you the truth these are very very basic presets and don't even look that good. Even the &quot;newpicks&quot; presets look better :igor:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking fuck... i guess i now have to write to copyright part also: &quot;You can't use effects coded by me if you charge/gain money from your presets&quot; Thanks a bunch! :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, I do AVS as a hobby, as a passion, an addiction, thats what I do AVS for...and I would hate anyone charging money for the presets.<br />
anyway, I dont think anyone would pay for those presets (no offence)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Hey!<br />
I'm allowed to charge money for them if I want to...<br />
Anyways, I'm selling them to wannabe DJs at the local flea markets who will pay $50 for any POS that has good advertising.  It's not my fault if they don't know better.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">shreyas_potnis</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th April 2003, 09:34</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">they would kick you if someone sent them some of tugg's presets or UnConeD's ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">GKZ</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th April 2003, 21:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">That's why I always cover my rear. ;)<br />
Anyways, I'm not trying to be the next UnConeD.  This is mostly a hobby (as in I don't spend more than 2 hours per preset on average.)  If I come up with something cool, that's great, if most of my stuff is mediocre (or worse,) so be it.<br />
<br />
Nick<br />
<br />
BTW... I'm making these on a 300 MHz system, so I have to keep them simple in order for them to work.  Of course, if a new PC appeared at my door... :D ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I never thought everyone would be so POed about the idea of shareware...  Oh well, c'est la vie.  Maybe I should keep the shareware version for the flea markets and put the full version up here... Whadd'ya think?<br />

<br />
If they took a month's worth of work, I understand, but from these peoples' responses...<br />

GKZ : You won't make it in life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Pffff! selling presets, this is lame, you aint gonna be rich this way, even the winamp is free, why chould then some n00b sell his presets?????????????<br />
you must be heck of the good avs-er, petter than UnConeD, fsk, elvis, skupers etc. to sell even just ONE of you'r presets, the presets are downloadable at winamp and deviantart any time FREE!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Look, since y'all are so pissed, expect the preset pack to be pulled down within the hour.  Happy?  I was trying to make some pocket change.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Go and work for it then. Don't sell noob presets, presets for a piece of subsoftware to a free piece of software. Not even a good ones. Submit the pack at WA or deviantart or wherever just don't charge for it unless it's worth paying for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">GKZ</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th April 2003, 01:55</div></div>

Well if you're an AVS Vj and you display your own work and get paid for a nights gig, that's ok. But selling AVS on the net? Well... do i need to say anything?<br />
<br />
Anyway hope you won't sell avs again and im glad you stopped it so soon, welcome to the forums GKZ :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah, welcome...just make sure you dont do that again! (am I sounding grown up? )No because you're asking if you're sounding grown up. Right, nick has met the welcome comittee. Lets get on with presets and forum activity now. Come on break it up nothing to see here :p</div></div><hr />
