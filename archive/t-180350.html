      <p class="post-content"><strong>UnConeD: Artist Of The Month Hang out with the Dirty Dozen.</strong><br />
      Is it possible for us to have artist of the month in the end of month?<br />
      <br />
      I think UnConeD for his pack Whacko Revisited is artist of the may. it is my opinion.<br />
      <br />
      If is it possible introduse artist of the month each month.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmmm nice idea, maybe..<br />
      <br />
      We would probably run out of artists pretty soon, not to mention the fact that most avsers already know most other avsers and their traits. But then, we do seem to be getting quite an influx of new artists.<br />
      <br />
      Also, Whacko Revisited was a remix pack, though i suppose coned's own remixes are worthy of such an award. :)<br />
      <br />
      anyway, thats just my two cents. Not saying its a horrible idea.<br />

      btw, where are you from superscope?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice idea indeed - but how about selecting a preset per month? Not everybody releases a new pack every month (as not no-one). My latest pack is from january 2003... so I prefer having a best preset of the month award instead. That is, if we choose to do something like this.</p>
