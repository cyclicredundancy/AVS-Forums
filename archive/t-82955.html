<div class="posttext">Where do you get all those?<br />
All I have are Firewurx, TV, Amoeba,  and 3d...<br />
(AVSgrabber - I already know where to have it, I just don't need it =) )<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, some more APEs are in UnConeD's Whacko IV AVS pack, and Fluid (just remembered I have it) is from JC's 7th pack (TheSinCityBrainClumps)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I do not know the location, but I found about an ape that takes the input from a webcam. There aren't that many options, but you can make an effect list with ignore input and whatever output you want. Additionally, it's a bit buggy, but closing the AVS and reopening it fixes the problem. You should be able to search for it within the AVS section...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So here they are!<br />
The file also includes the new 3D ape's from Unconed!<br />
It was to big to post but you can download it from:<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Dang... now people don't have to download WA-IV anymore to get them :)<br />
<br />
I was planning on releasing the APEs as a separate ZIP, but after a week or so to provide people with an incentive to download the pack first :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I downloaded it the first day UnConeD =)....<br />
<br />
BTW - - What does color reduction do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd April 2002, 14:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Color reduction sets the 'n' lowest bits of the color value to 0. A little more detail:<br />
<br />
In 24-bit colour mode (or 32-bit), each color channel RGB is an 8-bit number (range 0-255). Color reduction reduces the accuracy of this number, so it introduces color bands and destroys gradients :). It was needed for the cartoon effect.<br />
You could already do this by the way, by putting a few &quot;Darken&quot; fast brightnesses, followed by a few &quot;Brighten&quot; fast brightnesses. Every time you darken it, you reduce the range &quot;0-255&quot; to &quot;0-127&quot; to &quot;0-63&quot;... then, you multiply again, but of course because of the rounding errors, you won't get the original picture back again.<br />
<br />
Suppose you have a nice gradient that can be represented by the numbers:<br />
[ 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 ]<br />
Divide by 5, round it off, and then multiply by 5 again:<br />
[ 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 20, 20 ]<br />
<br />
That's how it works, except it uses binary, because that's waaaay speedier on CPUs. The effect is only noticable when enough bits are 'destroyed' (and there are fewer color levels left). Because the effect needed to be fast, the code had to be simple. The resulting image is always darker than the input image (and white is never truly white).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i browsered these pages for about 20 minutes and didn't find any apes..mayby you should deliver the ape's page link or givin simply the link to download location<br />
<br />
hun about 3d ape..(i don't know if justin's got a beard bit if he was probably laughin in when he took it to production....<br />
<br />
i'm not well imformed in 3d rendering else that it's incredibly easy to make a teapot........huh........it were probably asked before..<br />
did someone make a 3ds to 3d.ape-in converter?<br />
<br />
the builder build best when all tools are in front of his two hands and eyes.....and depending on the tool he must take care to his feets..ape's not so heavy...so if the tutorials were simply draged and droped in a txt file with download links writen black it'd be a good step in toolkit.........................................................................................<br />
<br />
that's what i normaly do so then my mind's got a securepoint......<br />
huh that's all......:)</div></div><hr />
