      I hope you realise that while you're drooling on those pixel-boobs, WildTangent is collecting every bit of personal, marketable information on you and sending it to other low-life companies.</p>

      Thank you. I might tolerate it as long as they are not stealing credit card numbers, or sending virurus', are they? I haven't recieved any more spam or pop ups than usually. And the dancers are pretty cool. Are there any avs visualization that are of dancers. or any other companies that are good.<br />
      Thanks<br />

      WildTangent installs so called spyware. I'm not sure what exactly they're sending through, but it probably tracks the websites you visit and such. Usually they collect information for marketing purposes so they can blast you with more annoying, targeted advertisements. As far as I know, the only way to get rid of the spyware is to get rid of all their software, but I recall that uninstalling their software still left some files on your system (at least that's how it was a year ago). They might've stopped doing that though.<br />

      Thank you for the info. I have a real girlfriend. I'm sorry if I asked in the wrong forum about about finding more plugins. I'm new here. I am trying to find more dancers, there great for projections at parties. Your not the first person I've heard bad things about wild tangent from. Is there an option to disable them from get info from my computer. or should I delete them all together. If so, how? are there any perticular files I need to delete? what kind of info does wild tangent take, and why is it bad? any thing you cold tell me would be greatly appricated<br />

      <p class="post-content">jubae: 1337 is 'hacker-speak' for 'leet', which stands for 'elite'. However if you see it used here, it is used ironically to laugh with silly kids who think "typ1n' l1ke diz iz c00l" or just to poke fun at eachother. So what Nic01 said:<br />
