			<strong>issue?</strong><br />
		
		

		Once I got the following issue with AVS: I turn on Winamp, enable Vis window with AVS plug-in, and Winamp terminates.<br />
Then I try to do it again with other visual plugins, <br />
- they worked properly.<br />
Try to turn on avs window again<br />
- crash repeats and <b>repeats again until system reboot.</b><br />
The same day before this I was installing JTFE v. 0.97.7 <br />
Opts: Win'XP SP2, Winamp v. 5.24, avs v. 2.81b - display/fullscreen overlay mode on, window opacity off.<br />
Preset - I dont remember<br />
Hardware: Video Nvidia GeForce FX 5700VE, NView off

		Does it crash on AVS startup or later?<br />
<br />
If on startup, do a <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1212729#clean" target="_blank">clean install</a><br />
<br />
If not, well, AVS just crashes now and then. Get used to it and save often

		Case? - The issue appears only when <br />
Jump To File Extra v. 0.97.7 (build 49) is installed on my computer.<br />
(Tested with reinstalling JTFE more than 5 times :mad:) <br />
Still, this test doesn't really prove anything.

		Based on that information, I'd be more inclined to believe the problem is with JTFE and not AVS... But still, I find it incredibly odd that AVS would be the only visualization plugin affected by this!<br />
<br />
The JTFE installer didn't accidentally include one of those obsolete APEs that's been known to cause problems, did it? Or, worse, mess with the AVS plugin DLL itself?<br />
<br />
This would be easier if we had some sort of error message.<br />
<br />
Here, try a little experiment: Look in your Winamp\Plugins folder for a &quot;vis_avs.dat&quot; file. This is a copy of the current preset, and if you delete it, AVS will have a blank preset next time you start it up. If you still get a crash when you start up AVS, then the problem is... well... it's something else. You may have to wait until JTFE build 50 or something.
