<div class="posttext">Hi! This is a question to the developers of the avs! How you made the output overlay? What do used? What programming language and libraries? I work in pascal and I want to make an app to run to desktop just like the avs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">you could just look at the source code for v2.81b which should answer all of your questions and can be found at http://mlipod.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mlipod/avs/ (it was meant to be in it's own repository but things got messed up and it ended up in the ml_ipod one for some reason). though the changes which constitute v2.81d can be found at http://nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/vis_avs_changed.zip (though is unlikely to affect what you're trying to do).<br />
<br />
otherwise, you'd be best looking on MSDN and other code related sites for how to do overlays as AVS's implementation is most likely not ideal / fully compatible with current multi-monitor setups, etc.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Its not an option cause the whole source code will be a mess. Also I dont mind for multi-monitors, one is just enough!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well you'll need to do some research yourself instead of hoping someone will give it to you all nicely pre-formatted and as part of a proper code example, as i've linked you to _everything_ which answers your question.<br />

<div class="posttext">Look, if you know the answer, just post. I want to know how they did it, and I am newbie in programming to understand the whole program.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">since when is being a dick a good starting point to get you somewhere? yeah, thought so</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">vampm: so i need to look at the code myself, decipher it, convert it to pascal and give it to you on a silver platter? i don't think so.<br />
<br />
i posted _everything_ i know and that is you wanted to know how AVS does it, well the source code is the answer and i'm not going to look through that to answer something that has no relevance or interest to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, I am not asking for this; All I need to have is some direction in this, general staff.<br />
<br />
Also, forget about pascal, I can work in C too.</div></div><hr />
