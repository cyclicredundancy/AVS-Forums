      <p class="post-content"><strong>Volume level histogram - How to?</strong><br />
      I need something very simple, but I do not know how to make it.<br />
      <br />
      <b>The Need:</b><br />
      I need a simple, non-flashy volume level histogram where the volume history moves across the screen drawing the current volume with the past volume levels trailing, much like the levels in a audio editor, but, continuously and indefinitely in real-time - Keeping the visual volume history of the last half hour - or perhaps have that timeframe variable.<br />
      <br />
      <b>The Reason:</b><br />
      I work for a community radio station along with 50 or so other volunteers. Volunteer DJ's often have a hard time adjusting the volume of their mic's to match the volume of the music. <u>If they could <i>see</i> the history</u>, they could <i>see</i> that their mic is too hot, or that they need to put up the volume a bit. With a visual history, they can compare their speaking volume with the audio on either side of it. I know there are many other community stations with the same issues, and this would be a very useful tool. I have looked for other application to accomplish this but there is nothing out there.<br />
      <br />
      Given the awesome things I have seen from this community, I expect this to be a pretty simple thing to do, but I don't really know how. Could someone please point me in the right direction.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks, I really appreciate it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I figured out a way, thats simple, but it wont be easy all the way through<br />
      <br />
      Here's the easy part<br />
      <br />
      Main:Clear every frame(unchecked)<br />
      <br />
      Render/superscope:<br />
      init:x=x-.999<br />
      point:y=-v<br />
      Set to spectrum, center, lines, color:white(or any color of your choice)<br />
      <br />
      Trans/movement:x=x+1/<font color="red">22500</font>(this number is important: 60{number of seconds in a minute} times 30 {number of minutes in a half hour(the time you want history recorded for)} time 12.5{the lowest frame rate I can get when I move my windowed performance all the way to the right}<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, the harder part is, this wont work unless the resolution of your AVS window is lower/equal to whatever number is in x=x+1/<font color="red">?</font>, meaning you need to either 1. get a giant screen to display this on, or 2. use a really crappy processer/cpu/whatever, or bog down your computor to get the frame rate down consistently under 1 fps, then, you only need a screen resolution of 1800(still pretty large though)<br />
      <br />
      luckily, the larger you make your screen resolution, natrually, the lower your frame rate, so you can just keep making the avs window bigger untill it works</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's the virtual effect/framerate limiter to limit your framerate to 1fps.<br />
      <br />
      You could also try using the megabuf() function to store the info.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Putting together the two previous posts, here's a preset that records the volume for as long as your screen is wide.<br />
      <br />
      ps. if you don't like the color shading, just remove the color codes (red=, green=, blue=, lines) from the superscope.</p>
