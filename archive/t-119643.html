		Okay...so I took a little time to figure stuff out...I noticed that some of the trans could take mathmatical equations...so after dinking around...this is what I got...the zip folder contains 4 presets...they are all the same except for a few different changes...I guess I have been watching it using the lowest resolution at 32bpp  you can go up higher and it slows down...320 works alright...I like it...hope you guys do too....I'm using a Sony Vaio FXA47 with a 1 ghz proc.  Heard that with this AVS stuff you don't need a super video card as the AVS works by sending its threads directly to the processor and no where else...well...anyways...let me know what you think....

		Your DM does nothing I'm afraid. You need to learn the syntax. This should get you started. Start about half way down the first page.<br />

And your superscope gets lost in the stars. Make it lines instead of points and you can see it.
