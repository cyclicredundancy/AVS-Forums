<div class="posttext">Hi dudes. This is kind a VJ stuff...<br />
So my problem is: I use Riva velocity video card with vhs &amp; super vhs outputs. The picture on tv's screen comes out cropped [with black borders]. Now I use to record AVS fullscreen on digital tape via s-vhs and then I capture it back to PC and use Crop in adobe premiere about 4% from each side. But now its getting hard to do this - I have not so much time to fuck with it...<br />
So I wondering maybe there is eny patch which streches picture automatically?<br />
Any advice?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You have it set to 100% screen height? It defaults to 80% if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yes, I had. This is not a problem of winamp, but depends from grphics card.<br />
I posted this into avs forum cuz many avs users use vhs-out feature, and maybe someone knows how to get rid of this..<br />
:blah:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I guess that in US and other 120 volts countries VHS is called NTSC. No, probably its What you use instead of pal standart. OK - VHS is a tape format. You can record both [pal/ntsc] on to it. So lets call my VHS output - Pal output or simply tv output. Maybe I get the ntsc signal from it? But my TV has a sign that it is &quot;NTSC ready&quot; [like somene are preparing to use ntsc in europe :D ] so there should be no problem with NTSC playback...<br />
<br />
Ok - I wrote this all for US citizens, to understand what I'm speaking about.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">I always thought that the video card would force it to the correct resolution for you. When running avs through tv out i've noticed that the res on the monitor and on the tv have been vastly different. I'm certain there is some hardware process invlolved in it which does all of that.<br />
<br />
You could always take the lazy approach and leave the borders there... just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th September 2002, 16:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">maybe I should use some hardware between pc and recorder, that streches the picture [it could be a video mixing board with zoom effect in use] but that panasonic mx-20, which is quite good thing costs fucking 1500$. I will not buy mixing console for this kind a using. And I dont need it for mixing, cuz I do all the mixes on Adobe premiere.<br />
<br />
////////////////////<br />
<br />
I wondering why this shows cropped.<br />
<br />
there is 2 resolutions for video out - 800x600 &amp; 620x400 or whatewer..<br />
<br />
PAL resolution is 720x576.<br />
<br />
so maybe conflict raises becouse res are different.<br />
<br />
I noticed that 800x600 is better than 620...<br />
<br />
If I run AVS fullscreen @ 800x600 and VHS out too is @ 800x600 then borders are so small as they can, but still - they are.<br />
<br />
Using any other combinations borders are larger and/or unproportional.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">perhaps you could tweak your tv out settings, i don't know about your card but with the geforce you can use nview to slide and stretch the tv out put like the controls on a monitor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th September 2002, 20:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:( <br />
I got nVidia RIVA TNT Velocity 4400. I can only slide image to all directions. No stretching. It seems that I should take it as it is...<br />
<br />
Shitty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">nview is a tool made by nvidia for manipulating tv output through their cards, it allows you to extend your desktop onto a tv or have the tv displaying what the monitor does, it also allows you to adjust the scale and position of the tv output. i think it may solve your problems, you can probably download it from the nvidia website.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Got the same problems with the TV-out of the laptop I use for projecting AVS with a beamer. There are black borders. Before I got this laptop I used an external VGA-TV-converter and this worked perfect (about $80).<br />
<br />
This is a problem of the graphic card's chipset/drivers and the way they scan/convert the VGA-res to TV-res. I read a threat somewhere about this problem (sorry, can't remember where). But unconed's right - cause there were posts stating that there is some software removing the borders...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks EL-vis. Now I got a reason to search for something.<br />
Thanks to jheriko too.<br />
<br />
Yesterday all went so wrong - I don't know why I decided to upgrade my 2.7x version to 2.81. In result - AVS fullscreen overlay mode does not work anymore.<br />
<br />
Any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th September 2002, 10:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Go back to 2.7x that's what I had to do 'cause AVS kept crashing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I will do so.<br />
<br />
I'm searching for 2.7x download somewhere now.<br />
<br />
I think I had a v2.78. maybe someone has it? Feel free to send it to my email (massive@netmail.lv)</div></div><hr />

FUCK!! I had downgraded back to 2.78. Fullscreen overlay does not work anyway.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
I need that fcking overlay mode!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">fullscreen overlay?? what's so special about it, it never worked for me anyway, just use normal overlay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 13:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">it newer worked for me too, but when I completely reinstalled all system, after that it worked and it was good [it got a fat-ass framerate, good resolution and it's fullscreen - ready for output]<br />
And when i had got use to it - its gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 13:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">If you are outputting to tv to record it to vhs wouldn't you want to use fullscreen mode anyway. I can't see any reason for fullscreen overlay being faster than fullscreen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 13:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I dont know too, I only know that overlay mode does not change resolution - it runs @ my default res, and somehow it is faster than simple fullscreen. This is what you can use as desktop background too. Even that worked for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 16:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">THat's probably 'cause your overlay reolution is lower than your fulscreen resolution. In overlay mode the resolution depends on the size of your AVS window. It is streched to cover your background. Fullscreen is a fixed resolution.<br />
<br />
Besides, the colours aren't quite right in overlay mode anyway. Sometimes there's a blue tinge.<br />
<br />
Another option is to use one of the capture utils that a few people have made and transfer the AVI to a tape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 18:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">in fact I'm not using it as desktop background. Just as usual fullscreen. I don't know from what it depends. I have tried to run it here at work - it newer worked on this pc, but today it suddenly works. Strange. I assume its pretty buggy option for now.. Maybe it runs only if you dont use macros in MS word [for example]... I dont know...<br />
<br />
I know that it was good, and now it's gone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mezzanine</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd September 2002, 19:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">So - finally I found a solution, which isn't really a solution.<br />
<br />
Suddenly fullscreen overlay mode conflicts with my screen resolution. Normally machine is running at 1152x864/32bits. If I decrease one of these settings then overlay mode works. So it runs at 1024x768/32bits or 1152x864/16bits.<br />
<br />
So,<br />
At 16bit color it runs at all resolutions<br />
At 32bit color it runs only at 1024x768 and down<br />
<br />
NOTICE (!) that I'm speaking about your screen resolution, not AVS fullscreen settings.<br />
<br />
From internal AVS resolution settings depends only quality of output and difference between simple fullscreen and fullscreen overlay is:<br />
[for example - fullscreen video mode is set to 800x600]<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;simple fullscreen resizes your screen resolution to real 800x600 that means -&gt; switching and flashing and black borders and poor framerate.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;fullscreen overlay is streched 800x600 image till it achieves your screen resolution - in my case 1152x864. This mode got some good habits - general one - it is fast, and it does not switch your monitor to an other resolution. Quality depends from fullscreen video mode setting. It seems that this picture is blured a little too, to make pixels softer...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because it doesn't use the normal interpolation filter, it uses the video overlay processor, which is designed for NTSC (Never The Same Colour) processing, which means things the human eye isn't likely to pick up on (apparently they exaggerate it) are 'enhanced'. Things like blocky patches where one of the channels is full strength, and a hsl system which increases the hue difference and screws with the interpolation.</div></div><hr />
