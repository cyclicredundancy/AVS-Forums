      <p class="post-content"><strong>Ateam AVS</strong><br />
      hello. my first pack of fresh AVS.<br />
      Because it is my first pack, if i did something wrong, let me know.<br />
      the pack is called Ateam, because everything I do is for this organization. I hope it isn't something wrong with that.<br />
      My first pack was made about 6 months ago, unfortunately I have to work in winamp lower then 3.0, because my machine is very slow.:confused:<br />
      So this is all for now, you can expect the next pack soon.;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">WA5 in classic mode isn't much slower than 2.x you know...<br />
      <br />
      I like Sunburster Ateam2 best i guess although it's a built-in..<br />
      <br />
      By the way, writing your comments in English would help me to understand what you're saying in them... or unless your Dutch is better ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">hm , responsible to music, i guess that when you're playing AVS in a disco I soud have some connection with the people. if the people are dancing to the beat, why shoudn't the AVS dance to the beat. :)<br />
      <br />
      by the way ;-c ,rattaplan, ehat is a built-in</p>

      <p class="post-content">A built-in effect is what we call a AVS effect that can't be customized (or hasn't been customized, like the movement, superscope &amp; dynamic movement examples) or is very limited in it (rotoblitter, blitter feedback, water bump)<br />
      <br />
      So that burster preset is a preset that uses default effects only :)<br />
      <br />
      But why on earth do you use Picture &amp; Picture II together? :igor: Picture II is much better than the old Picture render, i suggest you only use that :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, I know, i forgot to delete it.;)<br />
      but if I am not using Picture however it is in editor, has any affect on the speed of AVS.<br />
      I promise that next AVS pack won't be so amater :blah:, i will try my best</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, I have a problem, with this AVS that I have posted inside.<br />
      I am thinking and i can not find out how to do next.<br />
      all I wan't to do is, that the camera coud go down on y axis, and than go up again.<br />
      can somebody please give me a help or some clue how to do it.<br />
      I have read the math help and al the other s..t:rolleyes:<br />
      I have find out how the DM works about one month ago, but I just can not figure out how do leave this effect alone, and than do another DM on this one.:(<br />
      or is there any other possibility to do it.<br />
      <br />
      I hope you understand me.:(<br />

      <p class="post-content">it's a nice pack, lot of simpleness, but it's cool, many of the presets have good beat reaction, very nice, the presets that stands out for me is "behind bars" &amp; "round the text ateam"</p>
