		This preset fakes a liquid metallic substance reflecting an XOR texture.<br />
Better see yourself and be sure to read the comment :)<br />
To the texture i used:<br />
I could write an APE texture mapper, that applies a texture from a buffer according to x/y coordinates from monochrome values in 2 other buffers (or 2 channels), to change the texture, but i think the XOR texture is just fine for now :)<br />

		Why you don't give it colors for much pretty that black &amp; white?<br />
Generally that is very nice AVS.<br />
good work.

		thanks :)<br />
it's black &amp; white for now because it's an XOR texture and thus monochrome. i could color the whole thing but it wouldnt look metallic anymore.<br />
As i wrote above i'm writing an APE atm that can put a texture on the quicksilver. It's nearly finished and the &quot;nearest&quot; filtering looks good already. i still need a bilinear filtering mode :) i wrote one but it seems to be veeeery slow :( can anyone tell me how to write a more effective bilinear filtering algorithm?<br />
source is an AVS buffer and i have floating point texture coordinates 0..(w-1)/0..(h-1)

		here it is: the same preset, enhanced with an APE that puts a custom texture on the quicksilver :)<br />
I used a texture from UnConeDs Final Whack simply because it looks great as a chrome texture :)<br />
The texturer itself can be quite versatile if you know how it works :)<br />
it simply takes the Green channel as X coordinate and the Blue channel as the Y coordinate. The texturer then looks for these given texture coordinates in the texture buffer (selectable by a dropdown box... ok a won't-drop-down-box, because it doesn't work somehow :( use the cursor keys to select instead)

		TomyLobo: you need to make the combobox higher. The height of the visible control is always the same, the size of the dropdown menu is determined by the control's height.<br />
<br />
Your bilinear seems awfully slow though, and doesn't seem very useful because you're only limited to 256 possible x/y values anyhow?

		i tried to change the height of that combo but it doesnt work<br />
i can only change the width, not the height :(<br />
<br />
i just put bilinear filtering in for completeness *g*<br />
<br />
btw UnConeD I made a chrome remix of your &quot;Rainbow Ball&quot; preset from Final Whack. It looks reflective now :)<br />
well, it's not really a remix, i removed most parts of the original preset and only kept the DM (which i modified, too)<br />
<br />
i also turned the whole XOR chrome effect into an APE. it's faster and it stores the gradient with 16 bits internally, which improves the image quality a bit on large resolutions.<br />
I'm going to include the textured chrome effect in it, too. this should REALLY increase image quality :)

		If you use MSVC++, you need to click the down arrow on the combobox inside the resource editor, before you can edit it.

		The quicksilver drips is cool and you can clearly see the reflection effect, but the rainbow ball remix looks just like it went through the xorifier machine :weird: and doesn't look good at all, nor reflective.

		yes, you're right... they're ned another mapping, not the linear one it's using now... I'm working on this :)

		nice flow remix :)<br />
btw i changed/optimised the convo a bit since that version...<br />
it's now<br />
i attached the convo config file<br />
<br />
the filter is now round instead of squared and the scale is 64 now, which makes the whole thing a lot faster
