		wow, you dare to call these files avs-preset... that's risky here! ;)<br />
<br />
sorry to say, but those *cough* presets *cough* are rather simple. the usual very first ones you get when you start to fiddle around with the objects in the avs-editor.<br />
<br />
but if you're having fun playing with it, it's ok. just don't expect to produce great stuff ;).<br />
in case you want to learn more about avs (eg how it works or how to make 'real' presets) you should have a look on these <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">help-files</a>

Ok, about the presets. You aren't going to impress anyone here with these. Most people here are have good avs skills, and there are some that are world class avsers. So, if you came here expecting to get praised for your work, trust me, that ain't happening. If you came here asking for help, good, you're growing up, and we'll help you.<br />
<br />
I'll put this bluntly, your presets are typical newbie presets, that each and every one of us (me especially, since  I have to review them) have seen hundreds of those, and maybe even made them before we gained some skills. Preset number 4 (I think) is better than the rest and shows that you might just have some talent for this. Try harder, and wait till you learn trigonometry at school. Then, and only then you might just make presets that someone here will like.<br />
<br />
And you should really listen to what UCD says.

My first ones were just practise to see what would happen if i do this and that. But now i have been makeing these for a while i acually started these when i downloaded winamp 5. which was like 4 months ago. And i lost them becuase of a viruse but i found them and so here they are i dont know if you will like them or not i just want to know what do you think about these.

		hey, mikwiththestick. Take it from me, these guys are VERY hard to impress in here. That's not bad, it means they are just drop dead f-ing primo at making presets. This is something that you need to have a love for, and keep at it. Go to deviant.art.com and look at the avs presets there; when you can get even close to those you have almost arrived. (I'm a noob myself, that's why I know this. Make like 10 or so presets that REALLY impress yourself, then make 10 or 20 more. What I'm trying to say is strive for greatness in AVS. Then with luck and the motivation to learn as you go, you may get there.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and the best advice I can give you (for what it's worth) is try not to use so many &quot;pre&quot; effects such as roto-blitter and ring and dot fountain. Use Superscope, Dynamic Movement, Distance modifier. In other words, the effects that are most under your control. Yes, I'm afraid you will have to learn more than a few things. There are tutorials out there (look at the skicky threads). But it will be worth it.<br />
<br />
Damn, Sorry for rambling on for so long!:igor:
