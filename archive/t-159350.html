      <p class="post-content"><strong>How to turn off AVS ? ? ?</strong><br />
      Ya I was just wondering how I turn off the AVS. As it slows much things down, and I don't like the fact it starts up each timea new tune plays. Does anyone know how I may set it up so as this does not happen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually it's not that obvious, when some FUCKING PRICK decided to make an installer that fucked with all my winamp settings and turned that on it took me weeks to find that thing. (h8 dicks that fk w/wa settings.) that and i'm pretty sure that the "run plugin on play" thing isn't in the FAQ (too lazy to check right now)</p>
