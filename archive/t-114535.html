      <p class="post-content"><strong>Crash bug in AVS</strong><br />
      This afternoon I was playing around with the Superscope a lot trying to make a dancing 'stick man' and Winamp kept crashing randomly with the error (hope I translate correctly) "The instruction at 0xsomething points to memory at 0xsomething. The read or write operation ("read") on the memory failed.". Then I click OK and Winamp exits.<br />
      Until I came to the point where I got this error just after saving my new work-in-progress preset - and now I get it every time I try to open it!<br />
      While the error message is on screen the music keeps playing and you can even see the first frame of my stick man in the AVS. But I can no longer continue working on it. Of course I am not happy now :(<br />
      I attached the file to this post - please fix this bug soon or tell me how to work around it!</p>

      And to tell you that the same bug is in 2.78 as well. Should I post it there too?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah it appear to go wrong on WA2 also.<br />
      <br />
      It does appear to be a bug but moving this to the AVS troubleshooting where hopefully someone will find out why it is crashing winamp. Probably exceeding some limits with crazy values or something and needs better validation limit checking.<br />
      <br />
      Once we know why then maybe a fix can be made and hopefully a work around for your code as you should easily be able to get what you want in AVS another way.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This only happens when you've exceeded the limits on how many variables you can use. You saved a file where you're using too many variables. There's really no way to fix it, sorry.<br />
      We've already added expanded variable support to the wishlist (several times, in fact), but that wishlist has been there for months, and it looks like AVS is going nowhere fast.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The only thing you can do is hex-edit the preset and modify the code to use less variables (note that you need to understand the AVS format for this, unless you make sure the modified code has the same length as the old code).</p>
