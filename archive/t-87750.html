		I can see that it's a compilation...<br />
<br />
Pointers for previously released ones :<br />
<br />
There goes the World : I like the simple either in Lines or in Dots, not solid... more variation to the preset.<br />
<br />
Hmm, okay, maybe not pointer<b>s</b><br />
<br />
About the new preset :<br />
<br />
What in the... Hmm, I don't think you should've published <i>that</i>... Pure SSC presets needs to be quite better than that :(

		this is not the real pack.....i didnt even really improve anything...this wasnt meant to be published..i just want my friend to take a look at it.....i tried to give it to him using aol but it wouldnt work so i posted it up....<br />
my bad....<br />
<br />
ohhh i have a question:<br />
onBeat:<br />
sometimes when i make a ss....<br />
i do all the coding and stuff....<br />
then when i think im finished i find this new way to make it better...like using the y var....okay so i decided to make the orginal y var change in the new var every beat....so i keep the old y in the per point and i put the new y var in the beat section....when its a beat it doesnt do anything?<br />
<br />
if its confusing to u guys...im sorry..ill post an example of it when i have a chance..thank you....

		Ah, OnBeat change between 2 shapes eh?<br />
<br />
If it's to switch between the 2 SSC vars :<br />
<br />
You've downloaded the zip of the 2 levels i the last topic right? Get the Onbeat Invert - It's the base of the switcher.<br />
<br />
Instead of using Alpha, use y, instead of 0 and 1, use the vars.<br />
<br />
Once you've learned this concept and know how to use it, you can use it for great things.<br />
<br />
Examples : Duo's enVISION, El-Vis's Medicated, and El-Vis's Space Odyssee 2003.

		This is just a post to attach a file I wanted to send to YaPoNDeeZzZzz.  I'd offered to help using my &quot;guesswork&quot; that's been wrong more than once before, so I've been using PMs to try to fix it.  Hope it helps<br />
<br />
--Don't forget to review my preview pack (I have some repetitious presets I need opinions on which to throw out).  Download the Zip from my thread!  It's available at <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....threadid=87661</a> :) Enjoy--
