      it's a new try, i made... and i think i will go on with play with effects ;-)<br />
      the SS is a modification from El-Vis's 3D-SS... i wonder if you will see it in the preset ;-)<br />
      now, i would like to read any comments..<br />
      <br />
      watch it with diffrent kind of music (slow, fast, upbeat, lowbeat, brooding, funky, classic, rock, trance....)<br />
      <br />
      I hope you will have a pleasure<br />

      why is it you people are prone to leaving in useless code??? anyway, i don't like it too much, it doesn't render enough, and what it does render is kind of vague and doesn't follow the music</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thats a wierd preset. I like it, but I feel it could use some more refinement. Not enough is going on, unless of course you are attempting to do some kind of minimalistic art with your design, in which case you hit your mark.</p>
