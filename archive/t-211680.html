      <p class="post-content">Hey cool pack! A lot good work has been released recently, this is just another one! :up:<br />
      <br />
      My favourite is <b>06 12</b>. although i don't know that one from yathosho you refered to. However i like the colors and their shades!<br />
      <br />
      Some of your updated presets ain't much different from what they have been previously, but i already liked them before ;). And all in all they gained some more style though. :cool:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow. I was pretty amazed by this pack in all honesty. Althought there isn't so much of the technical complexity I usually praise for no good reason, most of the presets are stylish and polished with smooth clean geometric lines and nice colour tones.<br />
      <br />
      good work, especially liked the modern art remix of wireframe</p>
