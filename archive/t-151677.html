			<strong>AVSGrabber 2.0 alpha</strong><br />
		
		

		Fancy a test-run? :)<br />
<br />

<br />
This is the alpha for AVSGrabber 2. I'm working on adding audio capturing. Right now there's no GUI for any of that though, it captures raw audio in the format winamp supplies (usually Stereo 44100Hz 16-bit PCM).<br />
<br />
Instructions:<br />
- Put the out_grab.dll in Winamp\Plugins<br />
- Put the avsgrabber.ape in Winamp\Plugins\AVS<br />
<br />
Start up Winamp2, go into output plugins and choose AVSGrabber Audio Plug-in. Fire up AVS, capture AVI as usual. If there is a small button on the taskbar saying AGAC, then it means it is listening for audio.<br />
<br />
The output plug-in is a very barebones waveoutput (no volume/balance settings) that acts as a passthrough for the audio being sent to AVSGrabber.<br />
I recommend switching back to regular waveout/directsound plug-ins after grabbing. Mine is very sucky :).<br />
<br />
The main issue now is passing the audio data from the output plug-in into AVS and AVSGrabber. It should be fast and not hang any of the existing threads (otherwise grabbed audio would skip).<br />
<br />
If the sound skips, go into AVS options, display, Render thread priority: Lowest. This will slow down avs a bit though.

		Works great over here :) I love it, though it seems (I'm not sure) That the output file won''t show up when grabbing isn't stopped properly, and winamp is closed. Though I got a nice speedy capture WITH SOUND over here.<br />
<br />
Good work UnconeD

		Magic.X: unfortunately the DSP plug-ins receive the audio as it is decoded and NOT when it is going to be played. So a DSP plug-in has no idea when the audio it receives should be sent to the AVI.<br />
That's why I used an output plug-in. I use the feedback from the waveout procedures to tell me when a block is ready to be sent to AVSGrabber.<br />
<br />
Pixelcraft: not sure what you mean, it puts the AVI at the path specified. If you didn't specify an absolute path, it's probably somewhere in the winamp directory.

		Nevermind, I found it :)<br />
<br />
I played it and there was no sound, and no picture.  It was playing, but all there was was a black screen.  This is a problem I had with the earlier version, it only worked every once in a while... :(

		Daemon: when you stop grabbing, the .avi file is finalised and closed. If you shut down AVS/Winamp, the .avi is not closed properly and will be corrupt.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Virtualdub</a> should still be able to read it though. It's also a handy program to compress the raw video and audio into something proper (like DivX + MP3 or Ogg).

		Oh but I closed it properly, and I could view the AVI nicely, when I found it. It just took about 5 minutes before it appeared in the folder I grabbed it to.
