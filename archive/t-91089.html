      <p class="post-content"><strong>PiMP is gone?</strong><br />
      I just noticed that PiMP is no longer on the winamp developer site. Only NSIS...<br />
      <br />
      When you go to the old URL <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/nsdn/pimp/" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/nsdn/pimp/</a> you still get a message, but the links in the menu are gone. Anyone know why? I don't feel like having to explain NSIS to everyone who wants to submit a plug-in, and I don't think you guys do either :p.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Isn't NSIS the descendent of PiMP? Aren't they pretty much the same?<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I found it pretty easy to use, just modify the example.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah of course, but I think PiMP was still easier. I have no troubles with NSIS either (in fact I need it), but some people might.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway I was telling people to "use PiMP or NSIS" up to this point, so it's good to know it isn't there anymore.</p>

      Also select compiler type to 'makensis-bz2.exe' and you will get more compression ost likely as AVS is mostly text.<br />

      Help it helps folks.</p>
