			<strong>Colormap</strong><br />
		
		

		I was making a preset with colormap. But it seems like it doesn't want to work the on-beat map changes when I load it up sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any ideas?

		You probably don't have the latest version of colormap.  It has that bug in one of the older versions.  Get the new one, and it should work. ;)

		It is v.1.2<br />
<br />
IT has a new feature that prohibits cycling when editing the colormap (when the colormap is selected, even if the editor is not visible!)

		So if you have the new version, make sure you're not focused on the colormap, because it's made not to switch then ;)

		Okay, I got 1.2, hmmm. If I have colormap as the last effect in my list will it be the one that is selected by default when I load up my preset?

		@Deamon: Just like i said. :p<br />
<br />
No, nothing is selected by default. But it will stay selected when you close the editor.

		Even when I select another effect it doesn't seem to want to change until I select colormap and then select another effect. Freaky. <br />
<br />
By the way, Magic.X, do you mean yes, it is selected by default if it is the last effect in the list? It isn't higlighted by default in the editor.

		Nothing is selected when the editor is closed, but if you have the editor open, you can see which one is selected.

		Did you ENABLE all the effect lists you like to cycle though?<br />
<br />
Enable has not the same function as in other effects. It enables single colormaps.

		I don't have the colormap in an effect list, but the buffer that I'm using is in an Ignore in, Ignore out enabled effect list. <br />
<br />
Do I have to have colormap in an effect list?<br />
<br />
Or do you mean did I check all the color maps enabled? That I did.

Me = Dumbass :p<br />
Of course i meant this.<br />
<br />
I have no f**king clue what else could cause colormap not to cycle.

		You're talking about a bug in the pre-release of the new colormap. I suggest you download it again but then the officially released version. I dunno where you can get it though.

		Thanks everyone, but it still isn't working right. <br />
That new colormap seems to be the exact same file, only it was modified 2 hours later than the one that I had. Regardless, it's still the same version that I had, and installing it made no (noticeable) changes to the preset.
