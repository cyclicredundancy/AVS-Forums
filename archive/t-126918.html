<div class="posttext">Well hello...again.. to all the people that might remember me (i doubt anyone did). i stoped posting like a year ago, been busy but i did have time to make some presets and would be very thankful if you guys take a look at them and tell me how u feel...(Lets just hope i still know how to attach something;) )<br />

<div class="posttext">checkerd - Not that complicated and the edges are kinda ugly.<br />
Color Wall-Bright Mosaic - The colors are awful.  It is also very repetitive - try making it morph.<br />
Come Together - Not bad.  Try putting a morphing DM on top of that nice effect.<br />
Expanded - Once again I don't like the colors.  Don't like the DM that much either.  Try to instead use a non-default SSC with some DM's that don't do the same thing over and over again.<br />
Forbidden - Seen similar before and this one isn't that reactive.  Plus, that movement gives it some hard edges.<br />
go plese - Very repetitive and static.  The weird thing you did with the top half of the background doesn't appeal to me either.<br />
mountain - A somewhat decent DM, but use something that will tile better and look better than the blue &quot;mountain&quot; with the lines in it.<br />
My View of the World - looks terrible on the edges that aren't being cleared.  Colors also need to change some more.<br />
Thru the Struggle - Colors are awful.  As anyone here will tell you, I don't like the moving particles when used like this.  The SSC's are way too random and it shouldn't go all white like that, IMO.<br />
<br />
Overall: 2.5.  These are very n00bish presets.  Learn some more advanced AVS techniques and work with your color choices.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">By &quot;morphing&quot; I mean to throw something on top that may make them look fluid or flowing.  DL zamuz's pack &quot;Visions&quot; and look at the &quot;flowy&quot; preset.  Jheriko, UnConeD, and many others have made nice flowing presets as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You messed up the rotation matrix stuff.  Don't mess with any of the x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3 stuff.<br />
<br />
Here's a fixed version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Long time no see. WB<br />
<br />
Come together was definately the best of your new presets.<br />
<br />
Most of your rotation errors were in your second rotation. You were doing it backwards kinda, almost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah, if he had done it completely backwards I think it might have worked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here is my review of your presets.<br />
<br />
Checkerd : Interesting but I have seen better.<br />
<br />
Color_Wall_Bright_Mosiac : Kind of ugly.<br />
<br />
Come-together : OK but could be a bit more music responsive.<br />
<br />
Expanded : Not very good.<br />
<br />
Forbidden : Not very music responsive.<br />
<br />
Go..please... :  Interesting.<br />
<br />
Mountain : Looks OK but the triangles aren't music responsive in any way.<br />
<br />
My-view-of-the-world-dym.4532 : Doesn't look that good.<br />
<br />
Thru_the_struggle : Nice but could probably be better.<br />
<br />
Sorry if my review of some presets is too harsh. Some of these presets need work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">all i see in that box preset is a line but i think its not showing because the &quot;x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,z3&quot; need changing for each side so that its placed on the right sxis. change around the x1 to y1 and y1 to x1 and with the xy2's in all of them on one scope to shift the axis around. Just mess with them like that until you can see where eash one is and get them on the right axis. Also that rotation is a bit sluggish and irritating, work on that too.</div></div><hr />
