			<strong>Nullsofts supersecret superhidden AVS stuff! // Codename &quot;LASER&quot;</strong><br />
		
		

		Crawling through the AVS-related windows i found some mysteriously named, hidden elements on the &quot;Display&quot; config screen.<br />
<br />
I got curious and tryed to reveal them. Finally i succeeded but none of those damn things seem to work.<br />
<br />
If you like, see yourselfes i uploaded a small app that will show you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this shows that there is at least something going on.<br />
<br />
I could imagine that &quot;LASER&quot; is some sort of VJ'ing upgrade. On the other side there is a checkbox sayin' something about database stuff.<br />
<br />
I have no real clue jet, but this is definately a function that's already included but still not ready, otherwise they'd just leave crap in their code and make the download bigger.<br />

Had'nt thought of searching, as it's quite hard to detect.<br />
<br />
Forget about it then.

		That mpeg was cool.  Too bad the LASER thing isn't actually included yet.

		Um, how would it be useful except to people who actually HAVE a laser and have the compatible interface with their PC?<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, it's just regular AVS except that only line-drawing components are included. The line drawing commands are then passed to the laser, the image generated by AVS itself is just so you can preview it on the PC too.<br />
In the MPEG, you could see the component list, which was much shorter (and of course, no effect lists).<br />
You could see a regular superscope, plus a bigger set of 'standard' effects (precoded stuff that can be tweaked, like osc-star or such).<br />
<br />
It's still cool though, because the kind of stuff we've been used to (freeform, real-time pluggable effects with infinite customizability) is actually majorly rare in the VJ'ing business, which still relies much on videoloops. The last big party I was at with projections did feature some sort of geiss-clone and wildtangent stuff, but it gets boring quick (yes, the wildtangent stuff works exactly like we think it does: it gets people's attention at first, but then they go 'um , boring!'). Usually 'real-time mixed and captured' means having a camera on the audience and using that in some way.

		The laser thing would be awesome to see at a party though.  Too bad lasers capable of using something like this are really damn expensive.
