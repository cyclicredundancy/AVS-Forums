      <p class="post-content">don't see a need for the channel-shift, as you can do the same using the color-map.. this also gives you better transitions</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah, you get more variety though - instead of 8 you get 48</p>

      <p class="post-content">But why would you need 48 different color settings? Even 8 is too much, usually it's best to carefully choose a couple of good colors and stick to them. The preset is more focused then.<br />
      <br />
      And btw. Replace/Replace effect list does nothing else than suck up your fps away.</p>

      </blockquote>Not quite. A lot of AVS artist stick to other places such as Deviantart, i.e. Amphirion, VHS-Guri and many others. And just when you think you know them all, another great artist appears from nowhere with the most beautiful stuff.<br />
      Remember, I too had been AVS'ing for almost two years before I joined the community. (not suggesting that I'm a 'great artist' :))

      <br />
      But you're right, there are only a handful avs'lers around at the forums, compared to the real number. I was also messing with avs for 2-3 years before i joined the forums in september (not suggesting that i'm productive... but that i'm having fun doing my stuff ;))
