      i have no idea how i made this. but i like it:D<br />
      <br />
      tell me what you think!<br />
      <br />
      the reason why i call it a subwoofer is because well, firstly, it kinda looks like one. and it changes colors with lots of bass (if there isn't much bass, then its usually a red color. but its a purplish color with bass. (i love how it starts out when you first open it (with a song playing before you open it))<br />
      <br />
      also, if the beat is strong enough, the thing kinda flashes with at least 95% accuracy on every beat. (i have techno in mind(of course i have a constant party of techno music in my head 24/7:p ))<br />
      <br />
      bleh, i keep having to edit.<br />
      ok, this visualization looks best when the AVS window is about as wide as the default size for the main window for the "modern" plugin, and about twice as high. any other size and it kind agets distorted to what it looks good at.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is a pretty typical "newbie" preset... standard movements, standard effects, standard colors.<br />
      <br />
      If you're going to use standard effects you should at least try to do /something/ interesting with them. Heck, you didn't even touch the dot fountain colors.<br />
      <br />
      I played around with it. Not much of the original is left, but now it looks like a real woofer.<br />
      <br />
      The shading is generated by first drawing a linear black/white gradient (superscope) and then mapping it into the woofer shape with the trans/movement. You can generate fakey shadings like this by defining the height, then adding x+y to them. Doen't work for detailed things though.</p>

      </blockquote>well sorry that i'm not a computer genius and don't know how to make wierd equations that work. and i didn't change the fountain colors because i liked how the current ones looked<br />

      <p class="post-content">The point is, everyone loves their first presets, even though they are almost always very mediocre. Spend more time with your presets and with the program, and you'll make more interesting and unique presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">UnConeD, I just added my preset (which is also available here in presets) to yours.But in order not to have yours not move with mine I had to use ignore and maximun which lightens the colors... anyway to make title show up a bit darker? Main thing is I was wondering if title could be circled around the outside of the center circle instead of just across (and timer circled around inside of center circle? I think it would look dynomite ;)</p>
