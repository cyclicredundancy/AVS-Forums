Mr_Nudge Volume 11.<br />
<br />
Over two years in the making, and it totally doesn't show.<br />
Unfortunately, this will also be my last avs work, as i've found less and less time to work on it, and avs is unusably unstable on my pc now.<br />
Thanks to everyone who has helped me over the years.<br />
<br />
In the zip is the presets, some texer images, and a font file you'll want to put in your windows/fonts directory.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry for not replying earlier but as you have noticed, hardly anyone still visits here.<br />
<br />
Only 7 presets, but still 7 more than none. <br />
Your comment on P54b seems true for most presets - Some more aggressive movements would be welcome now and then.<br />
P42b doesn't seem to be correct for me.. none of the effects seem to work - If I remove everything below the T2 the preset remains the same. It's nothing like the one in WFC7<br />
Fusion is great! <br />
I have mixed feelings about Candy cube - The background is nice but the cube is ... Well, just another cube like all the others out there<br />
My Cartoon Life is the star of the pack for me. Much, much better than the WFC7 one!<br />
Heh Wireframe. At one day in your life you'll make Wireframe XX. it may not be in a pack but I just know you'll make it before your 50th birthday. You're addicted to it :)<br />
<br />
Sad to see another one leave.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it's a bad idea to distribute a copyrighted font really. i'd try not to use one in the first place, unless it's very common<br />
