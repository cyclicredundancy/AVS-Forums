i have a couple simple tutorials of stuff up atm.  i would really like a list of topics that need addressed, since i can't really think of them by myself ;)<br />
brought up so far are megabuf usage and aspect correction...eventually (i.e. maybe never) they'll get done.  <br />
<br />
so yeah. i'm not really &quot;in&quot; the avs community anymore, tho i'm still in the avs gang, and i'd still like to get this stuff done.  if you have any serious requests post them.  if you don't, just let the thread die, no need to bitch or anything ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, a couple of things from the top of my hat:<br />
<br />
1) Speed fixed on framerate<br />
<br />
2) Size of particles in texer II depend on resolution.<br />
<br />
3) How to render static backgrounds only once during startup or resolution change. (use of codable effect lists)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well not really sure were you asking for this sort of stuff or something more technical, like megabuf...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no, those are good ideas...i'm not intimately familiar with all of them but i'll look into what i can do with them :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Perhaps you could explain the code of 3D-superscopes. Also i'd appreciate some comments about dynamic movement (some dos &amp; don'ts would be nice either: how to avoid flickering on the screen or ugly edges...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that was the old primer, i'm writing a new one.  even if i wasn't, you still should have taken a look at what i had up before telling me to rewrite it.  and honestly, in your few postings here you're starting to get on my nerves really fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">1) I'm not telling you what to do!<br />
2) you asked for topics the new primer should contain and you said by yourself that the old primer &quot;dealt with 3d in a fairly crappy way&quot;. Therefore my suggestion. Can't you just take the usefull ideas and leave the rest unnoticed?<br />
<br />
--edit---<br />
Meanwhile i think this all has been a misunderstanding: I read this thread and you said no word about 3D when you listed up the things you planned. As 3D is very interesting to me at the moment i made that suggestion.<br />
For my part i excuse me if i said anything nasty.<br />
Hope you see things similar, Atero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, a little offtopic here but what exactly does (g)megabuf() do? As far as i know its just another form of storing variables to use in other effects to syncronize(spelling:confused: ) stuff. I know how to use it: a=assign(megabuf(##),var), but if thats all it does why don't people just use reg##? it's a lot less typing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">S-uper_T-oast</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th October 2004, 22:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">(g)megabuf is what we received when we asked for array support. What it allows it gives you a 1 million(right?) varibale buffer that you can use in your presets. It has ease of use because numbers can be easily stored to it using only<br />
<br />
assign(megabuf(##),  )<br />
<br />
and can then be recalled just by using the megabuf(##)<br />
<br />
That's for basics meagabuf can also be used for even cooler things using loops, like<br />
<br />
loop(N,exec2(assign(c,c+1),assign(megabuf(c), ##)))<br />
<br />
The possibilities are endless, and it provides an easy to control large group of variable. And then the gmegabuf, that is even better in that it can allow you to share 1 million variables easily with other parts of your preset.</div></div><hr />
