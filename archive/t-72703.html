      <p class="post-content"><strong>Attracting more people to the forum</strong><br />
      We need to attract more people to our forum. I look at all the other WinAmp forums and there is a hundred messages a day being posted while our forum has about ten. This is puzzling because there are certainly not a lack of AVS developers out there. Maybe we can all do a pack together and release it to promote the forum. We could also do a bunch of reviews and plug the forum somewhere in the review. What do people think about this? Anyone have any ideas of there own?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Other forums</strong><br />
      Name some other popular forums? This one is nice, but because it's on the Winamp site, it tends to attract a lot of newbies. Some people don't like this, so they don't hang around here because of the 'silly' questions sometimes asked.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm talking about this forum versus all the other forums on the Winamp page (General Discussion, Share-Your-Skin-Love Forum) nor versus other AVS forums. There are all kinds of AVS packs released each week, but only a handful of people at this forum. I just think it would be nice to have 10 or 20 more people hanging around here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, it's probably because the forum is relatively new, as opposed to most others, which have been around since late April 2000.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.<br />
      I'm a newbie here (obviously), but I have found everyone here so far very friendly and helpful! And it's great to meet like minded people who just love AVS (some maybe even more than me).<br />
      I guess attracting people here would be cool but at the same time I kinda like the eliteist feel we have here right now as we are part of AVS in our own little ways.<br />
      Maybe a better idea would be to have 2 AVS forums - a general one for everyone, and another more 'elite' forum for the "AVS Masters".<br />
      <br />
      Whaddya think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">While I do like the 'elite' feeling, I don't know if it would be a good idea to have two forums. For one, it would limit the newbies in getting any solid help and two, whether newbie or master we are all talking about the same thing.<br />
      <br />
      Either way, I still like my idea about attracting new people so what I'm going to do is plug the forum somewhere in my new avs pack. ;)Furthermore, if I rate someone elses pack that I think is solid, I'm going to add on a short line about visiting us in the forum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi there<br />
      I just wanted to say I think you are all lovely people, and if you stay as fluffy as you are you will attract new members to this forum like myself. Keep on being so helpful and wonderful, and I hope to add some new APE's for you all to play with in the next month, as way of thanx.<br />
      Stay sweet<br />

      </blockquote>Luck I guess or from Geiss' website. But as it is a Nullsoft product it really should be on the forums homepage now.<br />
      <br />
      Actually there are loads so-called 'hidden' forums like the MD ones.

      <p class="post-content">I have two things to say.<br />
      <br />
      1. I still want more people in the forum. So I posted up a note in the readme file of my new pack mentioning the forum. Because I'm lazy :), thats about as far as I'm going to take it.<br />
      <br />
      2. I'm starting a new thread about Milkdrop and AVS compairing the two. If you know anything about MilkDrop, go post something. :) Thanks.</p>

      <br />
      I will definatly be posting to your thread I will link to it from the MilkDrop forums so we can discuss it.<br />
