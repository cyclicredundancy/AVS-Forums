		Ok, I made this a long time ago, I straightened it up a bit, and now I still think it's the trippiest effect I've ever made.  Is this really even a preset?  I think it could be.  It looks like beat reactive gelatin or something.  Strange:igor:

		Nice, but it would be cooler if the pattern changed.

		I don't really like the crazy DM's like that one.  Made a couple myself, but never really liked it too much - it always seems to flash.<br />
<br />
Would be better if the pattern changed though - like Jaheckelsafar said.

		Ummm...Needs smth more! Get rid of the moving particles and add something more interesting.Or make a wavey DM :)

		Decent preset but slightly boring and it uses moving particles and a bunch of other  simple effects.

		Decent color tricks (though i hate xor, yuck...) , but very dull &amp; unresponsive.<br />
<br />
few suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Make the pattern change (more interesting)<br />
2) Make it music reactive or very beat responsive<br />
3) Get rid of the XOR (just my personal taste ;))

		The main thing I'm trying to figure out with coding now is shifting DMs.  I have read the huge thread the Nic01 wrote about it (and a few other things) and I'm sort of getting the hang of it.  That is a good idea though.  And don't worry Tug, I'll dispose of XOR.  It seems like a few of the effects created by nullsoft were weird ones created for the hell of it.:D(like XOR, rotating stars, etc.)

		Xor is good for solid shapes and likes, but for flows/gradient colors it just doesn't work... Example, you can &quot;invert&quot; a certain area by using a ssc rectangle shape and with xor blending.
