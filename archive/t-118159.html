				 <i>From the AVS FAQ....</i><br />
Question #4: I saw someone who had AVS running as his animated desktop background! How is this possible?<br />
<br />
First, start AVS and open up the configuration dialog (see Q#2). Now, click the 'Settings' menu, and then 'Display'. On the right-hand side, a box labeled 'Overlay mode' should appear. Enable this, and check 'set desktop to color', you should now have an AVS desktop background.<br />
<br />
If you don't see anything, try removing any desktop wallpaper you may have and turning off Active Desktop. Both can be done through the Display panel in the Windows Control Panel.<br />
<br />
If you do see AVS, but it's covered in a bunch of dots, you're probably running in 16-bit colour mode (High Colour). The overlay-colour that is used can't be properly displayed in 16-bit, and so Windows draws dots of the nearest colours to give you the impression of the right colour. Try a different (slightly brighter or darker) overlay colour, or switch to 24-bit/32-bit (True Colour)</blockquote>

		I read that exact thing in the FAQ and it doesn't work. Does that mean I need 32-bit?

shouln't it be on 24/32 bits anyway? <br />
why settle for less when it makes NO speed differences in windows?<br />
<br />
if your video card can't handle it then your PC is probably too old for AVS to be used for any decent use anyway.<br />

		I have 24 bit support in Win98 and AVS works fine normally and in fullscreen. In Linux on the same machine I get 32 bit colors, but WinAmp isn't available for Linux yet. I think I'll write an app to make it work or something.

		AVS calculates everything in 32-bit internally. Any other bitdepth on your display causes a small slowdown.<br />
<br />
24-bit is about the worst mode to use because it doesn't have word-aligned pixels, try switching your bitdepth to 32-bit or change your display res (some cards don't support overlay &gt; 1024x768).<br />
<br />
And about the Win98 thing, it's YOUR computer, not Win98. Don't you think it's kind of arrogant to assume that just because you can't get something to work that it won't work at all for anyone?

<br />

		update, yes it works on win 98. i set the display to 32 bit colour. also you would have to disable active desktop.
