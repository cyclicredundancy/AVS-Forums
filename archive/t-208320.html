<div class="posttext">This preset has a Sierpinski's gasket with draggable vertices. <br />
<br />
From the comment:<br />
<br />
Draggable Sierpinski by Ssssmemyself<br />
<br />
I made this after seeing PAK-9's awesome preset Night Bike. His slick sliders and stuff inspired me to make my own fancy mouse-controlled preset. If you drag the vertices too fast, or too near each other, stuff gets slightly buggy. I could probably fix this, but it would involve rewriting using gmegabuf.<br />
<br />
Feedback is appreciated, contact me at ssssmemyself@hotmail.com<br />
<br />
P.S. Is there any reason why we can't post avs files without zipping them first? A quick search didn't turn up much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">avs saves your presets in plain text, so putting them up here not in zips would probably screw up the file extension or something like that :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, the forums only allow certain extensions to be uploaded (I guess so people can'ty upload &quot;coolpic.jpg.exe&quot;), and plus if you zip it it'll keep all the images you may have used with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">If your interested, my latest and greatest mouse control preset is here:<br />

<br />
but to run it you will need this:<br />

<br />
and the triangle.ape which I ... er... can't seem to find on Tomy's Devart page so you'll need to get it from somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's a modified (improved) version of the preset for you to look at</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heh, yeah, I was planning on fixing up that text junk. I realized ~5 minutes after posting that the text wouldn't match up with the lines if the window was resized. That was an awfully stupid assumption on my part. I was also thinking about adding stuff in the background to make it look better, but this was just a little experiment of mine. You did a really nice job fixing it up. Thanks for the suggestions about hooks and stuff.</div></div><hr />
