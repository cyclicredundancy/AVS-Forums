		This preset has a Sierpinski's gasket with draggable vertices. <br />
<br />
From the comment:<br />
<br />
Draggable Sierpinski by Ssssmemyself<br />
<br />
I made this after seeing PAK-9's awesome preset Night Bike. His slick sliders and stuff inspired me to make my own fancy mouse-controlled preset. If you drag the vertices too fast, or too near each other, stuff gets slightly buggy. I could probably fix this, but it would involve rewriting using gmegabuf.<br />
<br />
Feedback is appreciated, contact me at <a href="mailto:ssssmemyself@hotmail.com">ssssmemyself@hotmail.com</a><br />
<br />
P.S. Is there any reason why we can't post avs files without zipping them first? A quick search didn't turn up much.

		avs saves your presets in plain text, so putting them up here not in zips would probably screw up the file extension or something like that :)

		Yeah, the forums only allow certain extensions to be uploaded (I guess so people can'ty upload &quot;coolpic.jpg.exe&quot;), and plus if you zip it it'll keep all the images you may have used with it.

		If your interested, my latest and greatest mouse control preset is here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/14766984/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/14766984/</a><br />
<br />
but to run it you will need this:<br />

<br />
and the triangle.ape which I ... er... can't seem to find on Tomy's Devart page so you'll need to get it from somewhere else.

		Heh, yeah, I was planning on fixing up that text junk. I realized ~5 minutes after posting that the text wouldn't match up with the lines if the window was resized. That was an awfully stupid assumption on my part. I was also thinking about adding stuff in the background to make it look better, but this was just a little experiment of mine. You did a really nice job fixing it up. Thanks for the suggestions about hooks and stuff.
