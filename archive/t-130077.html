<br />
ive wondered for quite a while how UnConeD made the tentacle Superscope, maby it would be possible for me to make one like it now :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Originally in UnConeD's comment for the original preset<br />
Basically, it animates a skeleton of a star-shape and then creates a polygon mesh of conical tubes around that.<br />
<br />
The rubber effect is actually very simple... each spike is made out of several joints which are rotated with a delay that increases with the distance to the center. When the star accelerates, the ends start to lag behind and they swirl around.<br />
The lighting consists of two omni-directional lights that move around.<br />
The actual rendering is done in software too of course: the shape is built out of 1440 gouraud shaded, z-buffered triangles. my effect sucks balls because theres no middle bit and theres no light and the 3d dosen't exactly look 3d but you can take that and work on it and give me some credit if you release it :)</div></div><hr />
