      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yea, this works well for live events</strong><br />
      Hook AVS up to some decks and then a projector - instant trippy fun.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Oh yeah!</strong><br />
      speaking of projectors, that's all I'm missing now, anyone know of any really good deals (best I've found so far is around 1000$..) I'm gonna do the rounds of the pawn shops though, maybe turn up a real gem, i hope!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>yeah..</strong><br />
      I looked on E-bay.. there wasn't much.. as a matter of fact, there was next to nothing.. unless I messed up and just didn't find them, therte a relatively few good deals on projectors on E-bay...<br />
      <br />
      But.. My buddy's dad owns a big-as production company, and I asked him what about hooking me up with a projector, and his dad might sponsor me bylending me a projector to do a few parties (sweet-ass)..<br />
      <br />
      He also told me he has at least one older but functional and perfect for my needs, projector that he might let slide at a really good price..<br />
