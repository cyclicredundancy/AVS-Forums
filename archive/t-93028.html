<div class="posttext">You only have to ask the question once, and this is more of a general AVS question than asking a question about an AVS preset you made or want to make, so it would be more appropriate to ask your question here :)  You're probably new to this; I'm just giving you a hard time :)<br />
<br />
This question has been asked so many times it isn't even funny.  (mainly it's the newbies that come in &amp; ask the same question...how do I make an AVS?  That queestion is answered in the FAQ).  You are probably beyond &quot;how do I make an AVS,&quot; and sometimes the existing things don't make sense.  <br />
<br />
But if you had already looked at all the threads I mentioned, at least say you looked at several threads &amp; still can't figure it out.  Then we'll come in on more of a &quot;tutoring&quot; basis.  DMs are a little harder to learn, so if your question fits in, it's okay to ask a question.  <br />
<br />
Be more specific!  There is an abundance of help out there...Just look for it!  :)<br />
<br />
Okay...I'll be nice and give you some spots to check out for starters.<br />
<br />
First, check the AVS faq (it'll be a sticky thread by UnConeD...right at the top of this page)<br />
<br />
Then check this thread http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90449 (be sure to download the zipped file in that thread)<br />
<br />
I believe Rovastar posted a hyperlink in the almost identical thread you started in the AVS Presets sub-forum; you might want to check that out.<br />
<br />
The following thread discusses DMs toward the end of it...and good DM instruction is kind of hard to find, so I'd take advantage of this opportunity.  The thread is http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661<br />
<br />
There's Atero's AVS Primer.  http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=88135 Be sure to read comments and txt documents.  They explain a lot<br />
<br />
Just look around a little-and most of all *TINKER* with AVS.  Take apart other people's work (but if you do use part of it, be sure to give them credit for it in your actual AVS pack release)<br />
<br />
This is just a start...hope it helps a little bit</div></div><hr />
