			<strong>Flat------------()-------Glossy</strong><br />
		
		

		I'd like to see an ape (or whatever) to adjust the gloss of colors from as flat as it can possibly get to as (see your face in mirror)<br />
glossy as it can get.<br />
   AND  don't say make it yourself, 'cause I'd have no idea how or even where to begin!!!

		How could a color be &quot;glossy&quot;?  You mean reflect the colors around it?  This would be almost impossible or incredibly slow.  Also, I see little practical use for it.  If you want something like ReflectOCube, then you have to encode the DM yourself, as AVS has no 3D support.

		Gloss as in how they make paint....there be  flat,satin finish,<br />
semi-gloss,gloss, and high gloss.<br />
   there could be some very nice effects  putting a flat color next to a high gloss one.

		Gloss has nothing to do with color but rather with the physical properties of a surface/material and its surrounding light environment.<br />
<br />
Your request betrays an amazing lack of understanding of optical physics and computer programming.

Search the web, rent books from the library, etc.<br />

But I have to admit, getting a higher education in the US is rediculously expensive. Like medicine, which is common good in places where the 'darn socialists' and 'damn commies' reign.

		Snoozin : Who says you need high and mighty level of education?<br />
<br />
*points to self*<br />
<br />
For now, just make a sphere and work your ass off to give it a nice finish - it's not exactly easy, but if you put some work into it...

		From what I'm guessing he means, he wants something which will at Glossy level, ramp the colours to create fake looking white highlights, and at flat level, reduce the ramp to remove those white highlights.<br />
<br />
Try combining a multiplier with a brightness.

		zevensoft has right idea about what I'm lookin for.. but miltplier &amp; brightness messes with color (not the shine [closest to what I need is bump]),trouble is I want the shine without the bump look.<br />
   I'd like an ape(cause I'd use it a lot in avs) but on more thought, the more proper place for it would be on the color chart/picker itself.  Wonder if paint store puters can show  flat &amp; gloss ?  Have to check it out next time I get to town.....

		Hmmh, then use Cmap, Conv Filter, fx lists, and prolly buffering - the whole shebang.

		Why don't use a photoeditor to create a glossy mask for any surface (your shiny effect). Then load the Bitmap into an effect list, save it to a buffer restore and it by a DM. Adjust the alphablending level from fully transparent (flat) and fully visible (shiny) as you like. Don't forget to use additive or max blending for the DM, otherwise it will replace the original.<br />
<br />
This should do as long as you dont want it to be a dynamic effect. And then again, you should still be able to do something by editing the DM.

		I appreciate all the help...  but lack of education makes a lot of it go over my head.  So maybe I can learn by seeing it done. So I attached an avs, what I'd like to see is the brown interleave with the shine (gloss) &amp; the yellow one flat. If anyone has time to play with it.<br />
     thanks again<br />
