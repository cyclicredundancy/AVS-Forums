Remote Sensor is just my second pack of avs's and I think they're just ok (so do other people). I was just wondering what I could do to make it a better pack. Plz don't suggest any big coding or stuff like that because I can't do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, remixes would be nice.</div></div><hr />

The key to a successful avs pack seems to be a mix of originality, technicality and plain old aesthetic beauty. This is why I think that EL-VIS, Tuggummi and UnConeD are probably the most popular avs artists around, most of their work is a good balance between these three things. All three of these things are also linked together, you can't be original without technical skill to some degree because more people have less technical skill and so there are fewer original ideas to be made with moving particles and blitter feedbacks, also a lot of the most attractive effects require some technical skill.. 3D for instance. Its also a pretty good idea to steer clear of filling a pack with lots of really similar presets or sequels.. I think this is why my eighth pack failed so spectacularly to have the effect of the two previous ones (and why my next pack will be great :p). There are a lot of different things that make a good avs pack and different people have different ideas on this, the best way would be to come up with your own conclusions by looking at the avs of others and deciding which *you* like best... then you know what sort of stuff you should make. I don't know about you but I tend to watch my own AVS much more than the AVS of others.. I think this is the best way to judge your own stlye.. by how much you like your presets. Even looking back at my more noobish presets I still really enjoy a lot of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The thing is, I don't understand dm's and scopes.<br />
Does it just take time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Code is just really simple logic.<br />
<br />
Here... think about it for a little bit.<br />
<br />
x=2*i-1;<br />
y=0;<br />
<br />
An SSC.. by reading the help that comes with it you should be able to figure out what this is without making it for real right? 'i is the position of the scope (0.. 1)' so by multiplying it by two and subtracting one the new range is -1 to 1 so by setting x=2*i-1 we are making the scope draw from -1 to 1 in the x axis.<br />
<br />
I really can not get what is so hard about it.. its not like you need to actually know anything more than the expression help, and that text crammed onto the SSC page, to code it. To code something specific however will just be a thing that comes with practise and mathematical knowledge. To start its probably best to experiment with the varying mathematical functions and remember the laws of code:<br />
<br />
variable=variable(operator)variable(operator)function(variable,variable);<br />
<br />
Avoid crazy invalid statements like x=y=0; that just confuses AVS. Or x+y=1;, it will not draw a straight line because AVS is not a math interpreter, it will do nothing because you are not assigning a value to a variable you are trying to assign it to x+y which you can not do.<br />
<br />
If you understand the basic rules then the only limit is your mathematical and programming knowledge.. expand both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't get u and v from anywhere, I made them, thats the whole point of scope code, you define values of variables and use them to set the x and y co-ords of the scope.<br />
<br />
u ranges from 0 to 2pi and v from 0 to 400pi, i then use these as parameters in that equation to define x1,y1,z1.. which is a set of coordinates on that shape.. the per point code is called repeatedly with a different value for i each time (going from 0 to 1) which in turn moves u and v through their ranges creating a sequence of points which lie on the shape. i then convert x1,y1,z1 into and x and y by doing 3 rotation matrices and a perspective calculation later on in the code.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero told me that AVS Primer v2.0 will not all be released this year, and it will be an ongoing project after the resource pack is released.  The first part (v1.75), however, should be out within a week, and after he gets all the bugs worked out he will release another version (v1.85). <br />

But it's going to be a really helpful resource once it finally comes :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hopefully he'll find some way of explaining how code works on a really fundamental level so that we can avoid this sort of thing. I find it hard to explain because I understood code from the first time I ever used it in qbasic.. a simple set of instructions that execute in order. I really can't see how anyone can get confused with the basic concept of code because it really is so really really *REALLY* simple. I can understand someone not being able to so some specific thing in code, because they can't see how, though. Perhaps you non-coders just don't understand what '=' does, I really don't know.</div></div><hr />

I find it very irritating that every time we make an explanation of anything, as soon as it goes off the first page it disappears into the void of threads, never to be looked upon by human eyes again. SEARCH FEATUTRE PEOPLE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Learning how to code takes time, of course it depends on the person and his/her will to learn new things. Also if you don't have any resourcers where you could learn things (like the forums) it probably takes longer. I have avsed since 1999 and i didn't learn how to code even the simpliest ssc until my 4th pack and by then i haved avsed for about a year or maybe a 1½ years, don't remember so well :p But the reason that i learned so slowly is that i didn't have any resources for information (nor i even didn't know where to look for) so i just basicly had to test&amp;try and try again and again and again... well you get the picture :)<br />
<br />
So it takes time, but don't be discourage by it. Only think hard before you decide how envolved you want to get in avs, because it really grabs you thight and won't let go :D And there are more important things in life than avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeh, same here. Thought I could never code, and I'm now even capable to define a rotating cube in a 3d space. Not that that is original, but hey, you've got to learn somehow.<br />
<br />
Here is another simple DM for you:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pixel:<br />
<br />
d=d*0.75;<br />
r=r+rt;<br />
<br />
frame:<br />
<br />
rt=rt+rts;<br />
<br />
on beat:<br />
<br />
rts=getosc(0,0,0)*0.1<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This will cause the whole screen to rotate slowly in a random direction. &quot;d=d*0.75&quot; is used to zoom in a little on the preset so you won't get any ugly sides. &quot;rt=r+rt&quot; will cause to add rt always to r, and not only once. &quot;rt+rts&quot; will cause to add rts always to rt, and not only once. &quot;rts=getosc(0,0,0)*0.1&quot; means that every beat there will be taken a number from the oscilope data between -1 and 1, and than smallened a bit, cause otherwise it'll go to fast. For now, remember getosc as a sort of rand(). The only profit in this movement is that it'll go left and right, instead of only one of the two.<br />
<br />
This is my most used DM, and also the one I learned first :).<br />
<br />
Play around with it a bit, slowly it'll all become clear for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For the fisrt thing, there are much better ways to, (in my opinion), make moving particles, but the only way I could think of making yours more beat reactive is by increasing the number by which you divide the sin( ans cos( by on beat using a variable that then decreses to a set point on frame. Second, you don't need  to get so goddamn crabby when somebody gives you a helpful suggestion, and from your response, I do think you are completly disabled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">s-t, i made a real moving particle system a long time ago, you'll have to search the forums for it tho...and yours isn't nearly correct, though it's a common misconception.  for a perfect, nondecaying orbit: an anchor point is randomized on beat, and the third derivative of the motion at any time is proportionate to the distance from that point.  so you have (ax,ay)=anchor, (px,py)=particle, (mx,my)=motion vector (second derivative).  at every step calculate the vector between (mx,my) and (ax,ay) on each axis, scale it down so you actually get a smooth movement, and add it to (mx,my).  to make the orbit decay then just do a logarithmic decay on (mx,my) every step as well (e.g. mx=mx*0.95)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'll look that up, I made my own semi-real moving particle system not that long ago, but I mainly just made up a system based on particle position and particle motion with a decay. <br />
