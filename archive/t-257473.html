<br />
I actually remember seeing similar patterns in someone's preset, which i dl'ed from visbot or deviantart I believe.  Can anyone help me out on the preset name/artist?  It was probably one of the most intense ones I ever saw.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
At second glance this should probably be in the 'presets' forum, so if a mod moves or deletes this that is just fine.

		well, basically it's just a matter of shifting and rotating.<br />
For a beginning artist (supposing you are) the best way would be a dynamic movement (DM for short) with rectangular coordinates (x and y) and one for the rotation (r).<br />
Add some absolute values (abs()) in x and y for the mirror effect
