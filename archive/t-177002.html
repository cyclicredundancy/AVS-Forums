		Good day 2 all winamp and AVS stuff.<br />
I'm TEDE  from Poland.<br />
That's my first AVS presets. I know they looks like old<br />
presets. But I need some lesson about a dynamic movement.<br />
A have no idea how use DM 2 for my ideas about it.<br />
I look at ELVIS presets and understand that DM has a great possibilities, <br />
but I can't use them. It's very sad. But nevermind I want 2 know your opinion about my presets. And I think that my presets can be used in another presets. May be ELVIS will use them? :) <br />
Please answer 2 me - 4 me it's important 2 know any reason 2 continue or stop my working on AVS. May be you'll help me, may be give me some literature or any manual about DM and superscope... who knows...<br />
<br />
With best regards TEDE. <br />
<br />

About the presets: they're actually quite good for first work. You're not afraid to start coding yourself, and the presets are quite attractive to look at. n00bish but attractive. Keep trying to mess around with stuff to get aquiainted [sp] with all AVS's possibilities. Also ty if you can learn from other's code, but don't rip; always give credit to whoever you use stuff from and ask for permission if needed.<br />
<br />
That'll get you there
