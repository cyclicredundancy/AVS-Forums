oh, and in case you couldn't complete sawg's thought, AVS also only runs AVS presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, except...no.  AVS's SVP/UVS loader is crap</div></div><hr />

yes, but the fact remains it can't really render svp or uvs  oh dear just been looking through some of your stuff. Initial thoughts was this is quite good artwork [site] <br />
saved that AVS 1.0 w[where the oh dear came from]<br />
<br />
I use XP [luckily] Seems theres a corruption in the installer. was the message I got. Thought you may like to check it.<br />
 And no Atero this is not a dig at you<br />
I was interested to see what you had done and decided to download ONLY after I had read comments on how good it was for  AVS NoOBS (like myself [sic])<br />
As I had A prob with the installer, I thought it right to pass theinfo back to you.<br />
I saved to standard ( it's requetsed location)/clicked install/Small GUI appeared saying  Corruption in installer<br />
no othe r info given.<br />
Thought you would like to know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Corruption in installer&quot; tells me nothing at all.  Most likely it's XP - it's a buggy piece of shit in the first place.  Both of the installers (one written by me and one by Jheriko) have worked fine for everybody else; at least I haven't gotten any other complaints.  I assume by &quot;AVS 1.0&quot; you're talking about TFF1.0 (maybe be, oh, I dunno, specific?) - that installer was made by Jheriko, and it's not been complained about in the forums once, and if I'm correct, that's the only place you could get the installer script anyway.<br />
<br />
And...what does this have to do with this thread?  Nothing.  I believe this goes back to that &quot;take 10 seconds to think about what you're doing BEFORE you do it&quot; :weird:</div></div><hr />
