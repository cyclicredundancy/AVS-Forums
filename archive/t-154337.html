		I would help,<br />
But nothing I seem to make here is of any good comparison to the standard.<br />
I make trippy and smooth AVS, ( I aim to anyhow. )<br />
Matrix just screams Jheriko grade technicality.<br />
And I can't do that due to a lack of brian cells :P<br />
But anyway... perhaps if im feeling real bored or down ill give it a go.

		Atero, Why you assume that everyone will start making new ones? Why not use the existing ones... Tho my Matrix preset was pretty horrid, i seriously advice to stay out of it!<br />
Use UnConeD's matrix preset (can't remember the name, but if memory serves me correctly it was in whacko II) or use Zevensoft's Matrix Reality... or any of the thousands of matrix presets... There are plenty just pick and choose, but of course you need to post everyone about permissions, so maybe this is a more convinient way, but that's also lazyness :p

		I can't really see what you can make of a preset in a skin ...<br />
but, if my preset named &quot;MatHarmo&quot; can be useful ...<br />

		New version (use bmp from above post)<br />
<br />
Some suggestions for the skin:<br />
A stretchable windowshade, like Modern's<br />
I really hate some WA3 skins' bulky 50-pixel-wide windowframes, make 'em nice and lean, maybe just one tentacle going round the edges.<br />
And maybe an 'avs friendly mode' button to switch off all CPU consuming elements.<br />
<br />
Ishan: Afaik it won't, it'll be in a seperate pack just like Venom AVS.

		Thanx for the pix, QuadHelix!:D<br />
I made a version with your background. It may be a bit too slow for older comps though, so I included an 'old school' version as well. I also updated the sentinel bmp.<br />
<br />
This 'micropack' also includes matrilogie (for downloading convenience).

		@every1 who DLd it (especially QuadHeliX): <br />
If you've got the latest Texer II switch off wraparound in all the texers in Matrilogie.<br />
I think I'll also update the bmp when it seems like the skin design is finished (the new glow looks much better in overlay).

		in my opinion it's a very bad idea (and annoying for the user) to use a static installer path. you can easily autodetect the installation path of winamp from the registry.

		A couple of things:<br />
colormap will be included with winamp5 final (dunno if it's already in rc10, since I didn't do a clean install, the avs2.8 in rc10 is apparently a buggy alpha).<br />
ae_player.bmp was only used in the first version of matrix invaders, ae_matim1-3 are used by matrix timescope, which you didn't include.<br />
I thought the framerate-independent game version of invaders (just called matrix invaders) would be enough, no need to include old/new school.<br />
Check your comments, the one in sentinel eye still says bullet tunnel :D .<br />
And it would be better imo if you'd put the artists' names in all the presets' names and maybe number them and try to put them in some order.<br />
