      <p class="post-content"><strong>Variable list.</strong><br />
      Hi I would like to know what all the variables used in AVS are and there meanings and ranges.<br />
      <br />
      I cannot find any documentation at all on any of these.<br />
      <br />
      eg Superscope<br />
      <br />
      px,py,pz,z1,x1, r, cx,etc,etx there seems to be millions of them<br />
      <br />
      The in window 'documentation' (term used loosely) it just says what x,y,i,v,b,red,green,blue,w,h are for but there appear to be loads more.<br />
      <br />
      The same with DM.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers,<br />

      <p class="post-content">The superscope contains 10 built-in variables:<br />
      <br />
      n - the number of points in the scope; 576 works best for most scopes.<br />
      i - the position along the scope, from 0 to 1; a percentage of n relative to which point is currently being drawn, i.e., if m=the point currently being drawn (counting up from 1 in integers), i=n/m.<br />
      x, y - the x and y coordinates for the point to be put<br />
      v - the volume value for the point at i; if you have a regular horizontal oscilloscope, v is the vertical position.<br />
      red, green, blue - the rgb values for any given point; overrides the selection under "Draw as: ..."<br />
      w, h - the width and height of the AVS window<br />
      <br />
      Movements use 4 variables, 2 at a time:<br />
      x, y - the rectangular (cartesian - coordinates) that span from -1 to 1<br />
      r, d - the polar coordinates; at any point r is the angle from the top of the screen to the center to the point, expressed in radians (divided by 360/(2*pi)=180/pi or about 57.29578); d is the distance from the center to the point, scaled (multiplied) by the square root of 2, or approx. 1.41421.<br />
      You can transfer between the two thus:<br />
      x=cos(r)*d; y=-sin(r)*d;<br />
      r=atan2(x,-y); d=sqrt(x*x+y*y)*sqrt(2);<br />
      <br />
      However, you can creaet other variables, that don't affect (or aren't affected by) AVS directly. Any combination of letters and numbers can be variables, so long as they start with a letter. They can pretty much be as long as you want, as well...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the info.<br />
      <br />
      I understand the user defined part.<br />
      <br />
      ALso it made things more confusing when the perpint equation of the SS I was loooking at UnConeD's smoking Kale8idoscope was bigger than the tiny 5 line box and I did not realise. Grrr.<br />
