      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      Really sick with the flu, can't wrap my brain around long division let alone the kind of fuzzy mathematics come trigonometry, come geometry, that is coding in AVS. Still I seem to be hopelessly addicted. I found myself downloading both TomyLobo's Triangle Rasterizer APE, and jaak's pack of presets.<br />
      <br />
      Well the presets I found were well, more like elements of visualizations than visualizations. A single twitchy-dancing plane, a single rotating sphere, and a single rotating torus. I can't make even a scribble yet so that's not a crit, it's just what I found:). I was amazed, to be perfectly honest. Solid 3Dimensional shapes "ooh, ahh, *drool*". I looked at UnConed's work with triangles(not my taste, too square, well, cubed), and learned where to place a color map.<br />
      <br />
      So I took the torus preset(has a bit of a naughty name, part of it's a word I reserve for extreme anger at extreme situations, so I'll just call it jaaka's torus preset). Made a color map, added it and color shift to the appropriate places in the tree. Then had something that looked nice, but still a single torus. I don't know what posessed me but I took Tuggummi's movement from Club Seizure(color enhanced) and pasted it into my little project. Looked pretty decent to my innexperienced eyes. So I added a Robo Blitter, and Colorfade.<br />
      <br />
      It's title: I can't code. So obvious, and so true. At any rate you have to have TomyLobo's Triangle Rasterizer APE should you find yourself curious enough to take a gander, it's located here: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7891629/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7891629/</a><br />
      <br />
      Obviously, suggestions, such as how to make it better, and even optimize it are welcome. For example, I'm pretty sure I could have improved on it by putting the colors specifically in the triangles rasterizer(will be called TR later?), and yeah, would be better still if I could code, but I think for an early try, and without knowing a lick of code(beyond having some of the stuff from Pak-9's manual memorized) it's not half-bad.<br />
      <br />
      Okay, sorry, it didn't upload my attatchment. Good thing I botherred to upload it to my freebie website <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/art2/nolita/I_can_t_code.html" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/art2/nolita/I_can_t_code.html</a> Yeah it's angelfire, I'm clearly a spaz.</p>
