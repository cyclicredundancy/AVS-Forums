      I'm about halfway through an entire pack devoted to the albumn KidA by Radiohead. This is the preset for the closing track, 'motion picture soundtrack'. I thought i'd put it up now to give you an idea of what to expect and also because i just finished it and it nearly put me in tears.<br />
      <br />
      Please dont judge this as you would a normal preset, cause its not a normal preset. And please, please, please try to find this song to listen to while you watch.<br />
      <br />
      i hope you enjoy..<br />
      <br />
      ps.. ive used this part of one of ucd's psuedo random dot-a-ma-jigs.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nice Preset. I like how it slowly fades from 'scene to scene'<br />
      <br />
      Maybe you should turn on some lights so you can see the brightness levels:D<br />

      <p class="post-content">wow, im glad you told him that.. he may well have gone through life not knowing otherwise.<br />
      <br />
      can someone fix up my preset so it is bright enough for ordinary liking, and then post it so i can see what i should be aiming for?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty stylish. You'd either have to make a pack of these or use it as an intro in a pack though. It's not the kind of thing you can just toss in the middle of any AVS pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, if you care to read my first comment,<br />
      <br />
      this is a preset among other presets of not necessarily the same style, as this is way too boaring to suit the other tracks on that albumn ie 'idioteque' or 'everything in ists right place'.<br />
      <br />
      You can imagine that this pack will not have the same contiuality as most packs.. but that wont neccessarily be a bad thing.<br />
      <br />
      It would be good if everyone got that albumn and really listened to it, cause its probably one of the best of all time, by ANY band, including pink floyd.</p>
