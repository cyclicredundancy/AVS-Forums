<div class="posttext">i keep trying to submit my latest avs pack to winamp.com but i keep getting 'an unexpected error occured when trying to submit your plug-in into our database' message whenever i try, my installer is an exe (i've tried three different installers an nsis, pimp and winzip self extractor) and the pictures are the .jpg's using the same encoding as other the .jpg's i used when submitting mu other packs. i'm wondering if it could be that i already have three packs sitting there waiting for review or if there is something else wrong, like is the site down or something? I've also tried submitting as a winamp 3 component (since the installer allows both wa2 and 3 installs) but that didn't work either.. is there something i'm missing?</div></div><hr />
