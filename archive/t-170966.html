      Made up some particle mumbo-jumbo using megabuf. Made the particles be spheres, gave the spheres independent rotatation and independent colors. Mad w00tness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Great! But what's the use of SetRenderMode when using linesize?<br />
      The particles come too near to (through) the screen though...<br />
      <br />
      btw, I think the lines are a bit too thick...</p>

      I dont understand what you mean by setrendermode, if you meant(sp) just drawmode, I didn't use it in the preset, if it is something else, please tell me.<br />
      <br />
      The problem with the particles coming to near has to do partly with the sphere shape I was using, the particle positions don't usually come close to the scrren, but the radius of the spheres is large enough that it fills in the extra space and then some, my only options were to either make the spheres smaller, move them further away from the screen, or to just blend out the dots that came to close to the screen, I chose(sp) to just blend out the dots that came to close.<br />
      <br />
      The lines are think to make the spheres seem more solid, it didn't really work though.</p>
