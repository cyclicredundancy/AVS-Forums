Bad.<br />

This was kinda discussed a while back: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=273522<br />
<br />
Milkdrop2 is now the default vis plugin with all new Winamp installs, which cuts down the rate any new people will see it too.<br />
<br />
Our saviour could be Fridge (http://code.google.com/p/fridge/), which is written by some of the best AVSers.<br />
<br />
I don't think Justin will make an AVS2 any time soon either. [Link] (http://www.askjf.com/index.php?q=87s)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmmm....at my advise, we need to keep high the true valor of AVS..don't you think? even if this is complicated...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I should say something about Fridge, not sure what though, development has crawled to a halt on account of both myself and PAK being busy with work and life...<br />
<br />
Give it a year or so and you should see something more like a visualiser than the interface we have hooked up to nothing atm, although there is a &quot;proof of concept&quot; for FridgeScript being used to render triangles here: http://groups.google.com/group/fridge-discussion/browse_thread/thread/c43a3325e034c431<br />
<br />
If anyone does want to pitch in for Fridge, here are the links to the relevent Google code projects. Contact myself or PAK-9 if you want to join...<br />
<br />
http://code.google.com/p/fridge/<br />
http://code.google.com/p/fridgescript/<br />
http://code.google.com/p/fsassembler/<br />
<br />
We are quite far off from needing resources and presets, but there is plenty of simple code work to be done for Fridge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Truly... The AVS community is no longer how it used to be some years back.<br />
I remember those times when the people forming the community were so active.. not only at the forums but at deviantart and mIRC...<br />
Those were the times when n00bs used to be flamed, when packs were released at an amazing frequency and even tournaments were held at the forums!<br />
I guess everybody has &quot;grown-up&quot; and have a life now.. :p<br />
<br />
and although jheriko, wotl, pak n yathosho are still doing their bit.. i guess most of the people forming the soul of community in those times are not active anymore.</div></div><hr />

everybody should write down their memories from those days :)  <br />
<br />
A small example, although it has a technical slant: http://jheriko-rtw.blogspot.com/2009/05/whittakers-method-and-brief-history-of.html<br />
<br />
I might have to write one about the Triangle APE/real-time dynamic lighting development at some point too. I really enjoyed making those presets, even though most of them never saw the light of day.<br />
<br />
I don't know if anyone still has a copy... I lost mine years ago sadly... but it all peaked with one preset that had dynamic shadows from animated lightmaps on a small environment.</div></div><hr />
