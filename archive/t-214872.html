      <p class="post-content"><strong>moving bitmaps?</strong><br />
      I didn't know where else to put this.<br />
      <br />
      I took a screen shot of a preset I did, and when I opened it (in plain old MS Paint) it was fully functional as a moving preset, but it was a .bmp! And then I sent the .bmp to a friend through Yahoo messenger, (without realizing she doesn't have Winamp) and she said it just showed her the Lotus logo (a visualization in another media player) so I assume that if she HAD Winamp, she would see this "moving bitmap" also. Is this some new feature that Winamp has recently implemented, or has it always been so and I have just been too dense to notice it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's just a weird thing that happens when you take screenshots of video stuff. They just show black but if you have something playing behind mspaint or whatever, it'll show through. It's not winamp, it's just an oddity.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So does that mean someone that was sent the .bmp file would or would not be able to see the movement? Or would it just appear black to them? Thanks for the reply</p>

      <p class="post-content">For them, it would appear black, unless they had a video or vis of their own playin, in which case that would show through. The thing you took a screenshot of would not show up for them at all.</p>

      it's called overlay<br />
      just deactivate overlay mode and that mysterious "feature" will be gone ;)<br />
      <br />
      in overlay mode, a program (such as winamp or wmp) just paints its window in a certain blend of black and tells the graphics card to paint everything, that is in this kind of black, with the video you're playing<br />
      <br />
      avs's overlay mode does that for the whole screen<br />
      it sets your desktop to that kind of black and then does the gfx card trick</p>
