      <p class="post-content"><strong>Frequency</strong><br />
      I am very new to AVS. Please excuse my questions if they seem simple, pointless or stupid. That aside I am curious if one is able to detect the specific frequencies in the song? My plan is to do beat detection. However from what I have read in the forums they are not tailored to what I would like. I want the avs to bump to the frequencies a subwhoofer would move to. This would be 25-100 hz for me. Can somebody help or give me a place to find what I am looking for? Thank you in advance.<br />

      <p class="post-content">m²k: that won't help one bit, if you don't know the spectrum and frame size.<br />
      <br />
      To figure out framesize, use a superscope like this:<br />
      x=i*2-1;y=getspec(i/576*3,0,0)<br />
      <br />
      The framesize is 576, so a width (relative to 0..1) of 3/576 gives you 3 samples in the spectrum plot.<br />
      As far as I know, framesize is independent on sampling rate.<br />
      <br />
      The highest frequency in the spectrum plot is the nyquist frequency, which is half your sampling rate. Most commonly the sampling rate is 44kHz, so the nyquist frequency is 22kHz.<br />
      <br />
      The lowest sample in the frequency component is the DC/0 Hz component. The second sample is 22 kHz / 576 = 38.2 Hz.<br />
      <br />
      The frequency scales up linearly, where frequency = (zero-based index) * 22 kHz / 576:<br />
      <br />
      So getspec(x,0,0), where x is:<br />
      0/576 -&gt; 0 Hz/DC<br />
      1/576 -&gt; 38.19 Hz<br />
      2/576 -&gt; 76.39 Hz<br />
      3/576 -&gt; 114.6 Hz<br />
      ...<br />
      574/576 -&gt; 21.92 kHz<br />
      575/576 -&gt; 21.96 kHz<br />
      576/576 -&gt; 22 kHz<br />
      <br />
      The frequency samples are discrete (as the superscope to discover framesize showed). To figure out in betweens, you would need to convolve the spectrum as dirac impulses, with sin(x****964; )/(x****964; ) where 2***960;/***964; = frequency spacing.<br />
      <br />
      However, you might get away with just linear interpolation though.<br />
      <br />
      For MP3s with other sampling rates, the frequencies are different. As far as I know you can't access the sampling rate from AVS, but 99% of all MP3s are sampled at 44kHz anyway. Maybe you'll find some at 48kHz, but then the frequency shift is minimal.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That helps a lot. I will have to learn some of the things you talk about but I get the jist of it. Just out of curiousity. Everything I listen to is wav files. So would the sampling be 48.1khz and the nyquist be 24.05kz? And if you guys could give me a link to a good site to learn more that would be great. Maybe like a tutorial? Thanks so much.</p>

      on what do you need a tutorial?<br />
      <br />
      To use what unconed just explained:<br />
      value=getspec(Hz/nyquist,0,channel);<br />
      or<br />
      value=getspec(Hz/sampling*2,0,channel);<br />
      <br />
      where channel is 0 for center, 1 for left and 2 for right channel</p>
