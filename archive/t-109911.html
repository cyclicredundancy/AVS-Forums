			<strong>Why dont Holliday Dancer work on WinAmp3</strong><br />
		
		

		Yo whats the deal with winamp3 plugins??? Valintine dancer works fine in 3 (it even created a Wild Tangent icon on the THINGER) however holliday dancer wont even install to winamp3. Considering it is made by the same organization, shouldnt it also add itself to the WT icon on the thinger??? I noticed that the vidio on thinger is crappy also. <br />
Maybe it needs drivers for the vidio playback like win media player???<br />
<br />
Is it time for me to delete winamp3, because winamp2 plays both fine and win media player took care of vidio up till now. The way I see it WINAMP is all about plugins, skins and other addon components, that is what sets it aside from all the other 100,000,000s of players, and it seems that vidio for WA3 is a fantasy. I dont understand the reason for the load up slowdown, where are the new (working) benefits for Winamp3 that would account for the launch slowness???<br />
<br />
As far as the AVS goes, it is cool, but needs more control. I have d/l alot of avs addons and cant just use the ones I like or set times for them. Winamp3 needs a playlist for the AVS with controls just like the playlist for music. A speed adjustment and change time set along with a queue of favorite avs would be sufficient...<br />
<br />
I really dont mean to bitch, but some changes are in order at least for the WT and Vidio mess ups. The avs is pretty cool the way it is, a plugin for the AVS controls would make winamp3 entirely worthwhile just for the avs...

		1.) Read the FAQ<br />
2.) WildTangent &lt;shudder&gt; has zip to do with AVS<br />
3.) WildTangent is spyware, and a low quality visualisation.<br />
4.) This post belongs elsewhere.

		a) Wrong forum<br />
b) Keep your post to one subject, instead of discussion a tons of unrelated things<br />
c) It's 'video', not 'vidio'.

		Aww, c'mon, jheriko, you know you love dancing chicks with large, bouncy frontal appendages<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, you've gone about this all wrong.  If you're going to bitch about WA3, go to the WA3 forum.  Your post really could belong in one of four forums on wa.com, none of them is AVS.  Also, if you have a complaint, don't just go flaming like a 9 year old.  You can flame them once they've ignored you or been bitchy about helping you.  Try asking politely why the thing is going wrong.  Which means this really belongs in the WA3 troubleshooting subforum, then, if you can't get an answer, in the WA3 bug reports subform.  All in all, very little of this post relates to AVS, so you should've made a seperate post for that instead of wasting our time with a thread that is disconnected from the forum.
