<div class="posttext">New question, same dumb newbie - what are the best programs for creating my own visualizations?  Free and otherwise is fine, but please mention if you know if the software you're listing is not free.  THANKS!!!<br />

<div class="posttext">Dude...start winamp and start AVS.Double click the AVS window...The AVS editor will popup and a + and a - will appear in the window at the upper left corner.You can add stuff with + and delete with -.Also check out Atero`s AVS primer which is going to be updated *soon*.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well you're in the avs forums so im assuming you want to make avs. did you not bother to check the FAQ (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567) staring you right in the face out there on the forum, erm thats hardly a new question. Somehow i think thats the first question everyone answers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">howlmoon you could also try MilkDrop.THere is a specific forum for it at forums.winamp.com and it is a nice visualization but AVS kicks ass with the graphics and the infinite posibilities of creation :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nice analogy :) I just thought i could be helpful not jerry seinfeld :) Anyway i tried milkdrop and ummm.....all the presets look the same IMHO and creating a new preset is too easy and you really dont have much posibilities. --:: AVS ::-- ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Heh, ya know Milkdrop is for those who want SPEEEEEEED!<br />
AVS is for thos who want to be ARTISTIC!<br />
<br />
http://www.htwm.de/mkrause1/polymorph/forum/images/smiles/smiley_flipa.gif<br />
I dont like Milkdrop at all, in fact i always feel like http://www.htwm.de/mkrause1/polymorph/forum/images/smiles/smiley_puke.gif ...<br />
<br />
But i won't say this too loud as this could finish in a sensless flame war.<br />
<br />
At least Milkdrop is good for those who like it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">True.Milkdrop is F A S T ! If you could combine milkdrop with avs...damn! it sure would be nice :o Instead of the avs editor you could have an editor on screen and it could be more simplified so that newbies could learn faster.I dont think everyone will agree with this idea but im just saying my opionion and how i would like avs to be :) Oh yeah and a skin for the avs editor :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I believe AVS is as good as it is because it is mostly based on 2D Calculations or could you imagine a 3D Water effect???<br />
<br />
But you're right there could be at least Hardware Supported 3D DM's and SuperScopes. But after 3D Calculation it all would hove to be mapped back into a 2D Picture. I dont know if that would really increase performance.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, 3D wont solve those things that really kil framerates, just like AVI's, Buffers or the PrOn APE for those who know and use... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So what? AVS in 64 Bit to accelerate it with an Athlon 64?? http://www.htwm.de/mkrause1/polymorph/forum/images/smiles/icon_confused.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">3D water effect as in the Water thing done in 3D, or looking at a picture through water?  The latter can be done with Water Bump quite easily, but a 3D water effect would be the same as a 3D blitter feedback or blur or anything else (that is, if you had the water you could get the rest of it, and vice versa).  The problem with doing true 3D trans is this: You're changing the complexity from n to n*sqrt(n), that is, n^2 to n^3.  Not only that, but you now need to a) layer each successive z-plane (uber, uber, uber, uber, uber slow, and static, too), or b) have a moving camera that raytraces the entire scene w/transparency.  If you want to know how slow THAT is, get a decent raytracing application (POV-ray or such), then find a scene with a whole shitload of smoke effects.  It'll take about five minutes to produce one scene at maybe 400x300 at best.<br />
So all in all a 3D effect would have to be very low-framerate and very low-rez, until everyone has dual 10Ghz processors in their system :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
AVS all the way. too many possibilities (Whether that's a bad or good thing =P)<br />
<br />
If AVS combine with MD, I'm out - my graphics card doesn't have any 3d acceleration...</div></div><hr />

It's not all PORN Mum, the APE is called Pr0n and inputs a constant Videostream from Video In Sources or Webcams directly into AVS - Awesome possibillitys but it makes your PC Crawl like shit... :hang:</div></div><hr />

If you can read french, you can have a look to this site<br />
<br />
http://perso.club-internet.fr/pcharpen  (click on AVS)<br />
<br />
If you can't, try to use an automatic translator (not so bad) by clicking on your flag at the bottom of the first page (english or german), and keep clicking on the links (in pages, not in menu) to navigate thru the 7 pages of my tutorial in your language ...</div></div><hr />
