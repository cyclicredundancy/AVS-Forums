<div class="posttext">ok in this preset(s) (there are two but they're almost the same thing) i tried to use the primary colors represented by fading particles to fade to the different colors in the spectrum, i notice it hardly ever produces green, and i would like any advice on what i would need to do to make it create a more full color spectrum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try using cyan, magenta and yellow. When you pick a color, go to the right side of the panel and fill in 255 in for two colors each time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the reason why green is missing in your presets is, that you used the primary colors of subtractive color combination (red, blue, yellow). Computers (and also AVS) use additive color combination where you have red, blue and green as primary colors! Also you have to set your 'color-donators' to additive draw mode (for the particles set: Blending Additive) cause otherwise you don't have any color mixing so that the other colors won't get mixed.<br />
<br />
I guess now you know yourself how to get that idea to work :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i think this will be my finished product, would love to hear what people think<br />

 sorry am going to have to double post, since i forgot to attach the file and it won't let me edit it in</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">^..^: the primary colors for subtractive coloring are /not/ &quot;red, blue, yellow&quot;, but &quot;magenta, cyan, yellow&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red, yellow, blue&quot; is an antique meme propagated by bad graphics teachers.<br />
<br />
And remember, the only reason there even is such a thing as primary colors is because we only have 3 different types of color receptors. Physics only knows the spectrum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">lol, ummm..... i'm not sure which one cyan is... :p or which specific one magenta is either lol, but do you guys like the end result?<br />
<br />
btw i may remake it if unconed tells me which colors are correct :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th May 2005, 11:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i'd say you should stick with red, green and blue (just as you did). It's the best way to get all colors mixed.<br />
<br />
In case you really want to use subtractive coloring in AVS,  use:<br />
(255,255,0) for yellow<br />
(0,255,255) for cyan    and<br />
(255,0,255) for magenta<br />
(correct me when im wrong again unconed ;))<br />
<br />
for more info about primary colors and coloring methods see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color<br />
and all the other links on that page</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i'll go change the colors and have a look to see what i like more<br />
<br />
i think RGB makes a fuller spectrum in this case, so i'll stick with that <br />
<br />
but you guys never answered my question : do you like it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the idea is not bad, but there are some things that can be improved.<br />
For example why is there a 'set rendermode'(set to 50/50) above the moving particles? Didn't you want to have additive draw mode?<br />
And why are you fading to yellow? That way you prefer one color in the result.<br />
<br />
Since this makes me think you're not that familiar with the components of AVS, i suggest you have a look here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">the fading to yellow was my mom's suggestion i think (i asked her about the primary colors and she started helping me with it) plus wouldn't it always favor some color? since i have to fade to a color? (even if it was black?) <br />
and about the render mode : i tried &quot;additive mode&quot; before for the dots and it resulted in kind of a white-out effect so i didn't try it for the set render mode.<br />
NOTE : i thought i still had the dots set to 50/50 also</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you were looking for a way to receive all the colors, I've attached a preset with particles of colors CMYK that does just that. As for the preset itself, as ^..^ said, the idea isn't bad. I'm not sure if this is what you may have been trying to achieve, but this is just my re-vision of it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Too-DAMN-Much</div><div class="date small text-muted">31st May 2005, 11:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">no that's not quite what i was trying to do, i meant the dots to be obliterated by the mosaic, and be there purely to mix colors, as a sidenote i do think using the scatter and blur trans defeat each other also (at least since i use blur to get the effect of being quasi anti-aliased.)<br />
i do like that, but if it's going to be done i think the mosaic and dots should definetly be a &quot;one or the other&quot; thing in terms of final visibility. <br />
i do think it was a rather nice preset though...</div></div><hr />
