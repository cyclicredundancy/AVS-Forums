			<strong>Quality of AVS screen</strong><br />
		
		

		I have used Winamp 2 for a year or two and i just downloaded Winamp 3 last night.  I like everything about the new version EXCEPT for some reason the AVS is running MUCH lower quality (resolution i believe) than 2 was. I understand from other forums that Winamps isnt as good as some other engines or w/e u call it.  I was unable to find a resolution control anywhere in the menu. I know its not my computer because the &quot;Water Girl&quot; that dances by Wild Tangent works great even on fullscreen.  I downloaded additional skins from other users and they were the same low quality as the Nullsoft ones. <br />
Can anyone please help me????????????<br />

		Most likely 'pixel doubling' is activated. Look in AVS' display options and turn it off (see the FAQ if you don't know how to configure AVS).<br />
<br />
AVS presets are not skins btw.

		Unconed most likely right.  You know that wildtanget installs spyware?  Use AVS or something better than any of wildtangets crap.  No spyware and better music detection.  AVS will be a little slower in winamp3 though since winamp3 is more processor/memory intensive.

		Do a google for &quot;Lavasoft AdAware&quot;. Note that Kazaa will not work after this.

		All you have to do is not delete cydoor :rolleyes: Besides, you could just get KaZaA Lite instead.  It's kind of a pain to set up, but DAMN is it worth it.

		Better than Adaware is Spybot search + destroy, it will replace the cyodor app and other ad apps with duds- Kazaa still works, except ad-free.  google for it.
