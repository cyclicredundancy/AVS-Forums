<div class="posttext">As many of you may know, presets using global variables are known to instantly crash Winamp when switching to a new preset. This occurs on all pcs running Windows 7. I have read that this phenomena only affects 64 bit operating systems but mine is a 32 bit os and I suffer the same problem. I have searched my hard drive for as many presets that I could find, that use global variables. On the advice of WoTl, I copied and pasted the code from the global variables into a superscope, and then disabled the ape plugin &quot;globmgr.ape&quot;. This wasn't as easy as it sounds, because in the process I would have to close Winamp twice and disable and re-enable globmgr.ape for every preset. If I didn't do things in the right order, Winamp would crash instantly. Fixing each preset took me several minutes.<br />
<br />
None of these presets are my work. I take no credit for the time and effort put forth by the original artists.<br />
<br />
I post these presets knowing that they now work fine on my Windows 7 pc. I hope they work on yours. Please let me know.<br />
<br />
I have included 3unfixed but renamed-to-make-inert copies of the following presets - synth-c - fallbot, synth-c - cool down in hell, and  synth-c - dancebot, with the hope that somebody who knows what they're doing can fix them. If there are any more presets out there that I have missed, let me know, I'd like to try to fix them!<br />
<br />
One last thing - you either need to delete or disable the plugin globmgr.ape in order to not crash Winamp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">don't forget gvm is able to read from .gvm files. usually a load of assign(gmegabuf(index),something); if a preset uses a .gvm file (i.e. for a 3d model) paste that in a separate ssc's init part. that has a character limit though so if the .gvm is too long the gmegabuf assigments can be separated through as many ssc's as you want.</div></div><hr />
