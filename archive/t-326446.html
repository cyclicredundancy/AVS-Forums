      <p class="post-content"><strong>Presets using Global Variables which I have fixed</strong><br />
      As many of you may know, presets using global variables are known to instantly crash Winamp when switching to a new preset. This occurs on all pcs running Windows 7. I have read that this phenomena only affects 64 bit operating systems but mine is a 32 bit os and I suffer the same problem. I have searched my hard drive for as many presets that I could find, that use global variables. On the advice of WoTl, I copied and pasted the code from the global variables into a superscope, and then disabled the ape plugin "globmgr.ape". This wasn't as easy as it sounds, because in the process I would have to close Winamp twice and disable and re-enable globmgr.ape for every preset. If I didn't do things in the right order, Winamp would crash instantly. Fixing each preset took me several minutes.<br />
      <br />
      None of these presets are my work. I take no credit for the time and effort put forth by the original artists.<br />
      <br />
      I post these presets knowing that they now work fine on my Windows 7 pc. I hope they work on yours. Please let me know.<br />
      <br />
      I have included 3<u>unfixed</u> but renamed-to-make-inert copies of the following presets - synth-c - fallbot, synth-c - cool down in hell, and synth-c - dancebot, with the hope that somebody who knows what they're doing can fix them. If there are any more presets out there that I have missed, let me know, I'd like to try to fix them!<br />
      <br />
      One last thing - you either need to delete or disable the plugin globmgr.ape in order to not crash Winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">don't forget gvm is able to read from .gvm files. usually a load of assign(gmegabuf(index),something); if a preset uses a .gvm file (i.e. for a 3d model) paste that in a separate ssc's init part. that has a character limit though so if the .gvm is too long the gmegabuf assigments can be separated through as many ssc's as you want.</p>
