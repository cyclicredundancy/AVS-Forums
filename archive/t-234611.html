<br />
<div class="posttext">ITs about half done as of now - a 4 more presets are in the works, and i still have to tweak some of these (and think up a name for UNTITLED)<br />
Any Comments would help me immensly.<br />
Anyway - Here it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd January 2006, 23:36</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Cool pack, some very nifty ideas and styles in here, im pretty sure i'll have to steal atleast some of them to use myself :p<br />
<br />
My favourites of the pack are as follows:<br />
<br />
Black Kandy<br />
The convolution and color fade create a very nice mellow effect, but the preset lacks some serious music response, though i don't think you can even apply it very well to this kind of presets.<br />
<br />
Central<br />
I quite like this one, but the on-beat pumping doesn't fit in my opinion or at the very least tone it down a bit.<br />
<br />
Never Strikes Twice<br />
Hands down one of the coolest lightning scopes i've seen ever, gotta steal that from you.<br />
<br />
Sparkle<br />
Ooh, shiny and somewhat original too only bad thing is the music response which could use some tweaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, for a first pack this is definetly a good collection, but i think you need to focus a bit more on the reaction side of the preset in the future. Most of these presets seemed to work the same no matter what kind of music you were playing.<br />
<br />
Well, keep up the good work :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JFASI</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2006, 02:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Very good stuff. I think that as far as reaction goes, you're fine (I dont listen to very beaty music :D). The colors and such are really good, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Kar-mAVS</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2006, 03:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks Tugg, and JFASI. I'll try and tweak the response before the release -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2006, 06:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">For a first pack, this is quite good!<br />
<br />
As Tugg mentioned I think you need to focus more on your response, because so far it seems you have a rather good style-- the presets are very pleasing visually-- but they do become a bit repetative.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my favorites include Black Kandy, Evil Eye (If you only slowed it down a bit, this would be a pretty sweet flow.), Flurry, Power, Sparkle, and Untitled (Which could use just a little fix up with the background, e.g. change the coordinates to 16 X 16 and zoom in, and perhaps add a bit of rotation or even a scatter in an effect list before the interleave with adjustable blends on the input and output.).<br />
<br />
But again, this is a rather good pack. And at only 13, you should have some grand ideas and visuals to present to us in the future! Keep it up! :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">13 years old work? Not bad, but mostly great :up:.<br />
<br />
Great Work<br />
--<br />
<br />
Black Kandy<br />
Holy shit, what can I say bout this.. It's really cool preset and such of simple. The convolution on the top works as well and produce nice spread effects.<br />
<br />
Flurry<br />
One of my favourite.. ;) Nemo's style.<br />
<br />
INTRO<br />
Uh, :) I've tried it before and it came up such like you done here.<br />
<br />
Organized Chaos<br />
Such a great techno preset. It's killing me :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Gud Luck! :D</div></div><hr />

If your stealing from me - can I steal your water reflection effect from here here little jellyfish for my half-done electric eel preset? PLZ<br />
<br />
:EDIT: Sorry about the triple post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th January 2006, 14:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well when i say steal, i mean the idea, i never directly use components of others (unless remixing of course) I just can't  understand other peoples codes.<br />
<br />
But i think i've stated in my comments what you can or can not do with my presets, just give credit and you're all clear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Saw the pack yesterday, was amazed but had to go, so now here's my big comment for this great first pack:<br />
<br />
-PYW [goo mix]<br />
up:nice mix,<br />
down:but the main effect is still from DasNoob, so not one of my favs<br />
<br />
-Black Candy<br />
up:gooey, yummy, the best b/w preset I've seen in a while! I'm not that much into b/w but this one is a +fav.<br />
down:beat response only<br />
<br />
-Central<br />
up: good oldschool preset, really good trip factor<br />
[could use more colors for my taste, though]<br />
down: gets too bright sometimes [although my music became mellow at one time], beat response only<br />
<br />
-Evil eye<br />
up: very good flow, simply a joy to watch<br />
down: colors a little too much colormap shine, beat response only [I'm copypasting now]<br />
<br />
-Flurry<br />
did that came from the &quot;macOS flurry screensaver?&quot; thread?<br />
up: if, well done! if not, well done + good idea ;) great preset, +fav! did you write the rotation by yourself?<br />
down: beat response only<br />
<br />
-Intro<br />
after having seen Flurry I thought: how old may he be? and was quite stunned when I read 13... you've got some skills for your age, looks promising!<br />
up: funny sphere<br />
down: overall apperance to RGBish imo<br />
tips: ~second Movement is useless I think and thus the AddBorder too, simply set the sphere in the 1st Movement a bit bigger [d = if(above(d,.42),... or sth like that].<br />
~and the super scopes could do with only n=2 since the z-dependent linesize is hardly visible with such little rotation and you'd avoid the ugly line-jittering.<br />
~an intro doesn't need to be responsive but let's do it here: in the texer you could've used getosc() to have a random but music dependent positioning of the dots.<br />
<br />
-Lifted<br />
up: good coloring, icy look, music response is better here. +fav<br />
down: nothing I could spot<br />
<br />
-Mecurys Rising<br />
up: v cool flame and ice effect you've created here!<br />
down: the object in the middle disturb though, looks like you had a good idea, but the grey thing didn't quite turn out that good<br />
<br />
-Never strikes twice<br />
up: nothing to say - awsome bolt effect!<br />
at first I thought you used the grassfield from ShockValue's football preset and looked for the DynaMove but found none and then I saw you made it with movements alone!<br />
down: although you have some good effects here I couldn't watch this for some time to enjoy, couse it still needs some style tweaking [this shouts for a remix :)]<br />
<br />
-Organized Chaos<br />
up: a very good rendition of a SimpleAsPossible preset +fav<br />
downs: none<br />
<br />
-Power<br />
up: metaballs, flow, mosaic, interleave. long story short: you pulled about every old trick to create a pleasing and +favable preset! :)<br />
down: response is ok, but could be better<br />
<br />
-Sparkle<br />
up: fast 'n stylish, good movements, response is ok,<br />
down: [though only volume]<br />
<br />
-Strands<br />
up: quite nice 3d movement/distortion imo<br />
down: standard coloring<br />
<br />
-Trailer<br />
up: though the concept is known, a preset that hugged my eyes! +fav<br />
down: beat response only<br />
<br />
-Untitled<br />
uncertain about this one, a bit color tweaking maybe...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, all in all really good pack!<br />
work on your music response and most of all keep making presets!<br />
I'll maybe do a remix or two...<br />
