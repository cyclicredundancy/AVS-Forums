<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's my detailed comments:<br />
<br />
A Mere Grid - A mere grid with lovely colors.  Movement isn't anything spectacular and the edges definitely show, but doesn't detract from the preset too much.<br />
Shine! - Even without a flowing DM this preset flows wonderfully.  Love the colors and the shine.<br />
The Core - Nice DM(I thought it was a morphing SSC until I looked at the code - amazing), but the preset as a whole doesn't do much.  Great DM, though.<br />
Shine - Oozic Remix - Different effect, but I liked the first one more.  The Channel Shift in this one is a bit too obvious.<br />
Comatose Gone Mad - Best effect I've ever seen using the colorfade/water effects.<br />
Particle Cube - Excellent even without the particles.  Really slow, though.<br />
Particle Cube - Texture Cube Remix - Like this one more.  Nice &quot;texture&quot; effect.<br />
Swirling Mass - Definitely looks nice.  Would be even nicer with some horizontal and vertical movements.<br />
Oldskool Stuff - Nice oldskool stuff.  Not my favorite, but has a nice effect to it.<br />
Nuclear - Turns a bit too white(and I don't really think it looks like Paranoya's - maybe if you threw in a starfield and some weird SSC's:p ).  Nice movement.<br />
The Snowflakes - Not the most exciting preset, but I like the synching of the &quot;wind&quot;.<br />
Codeless Warping - Kinda interesting but not really.<br />
Floating Lines - Interesting, but needs something else.  Maybe a moving camera or something.<br />
Alphacore - Interesting, smooth preset.  Kinda mesmerizing.<br />
Sea of Colors 2 - Very smooth, and the colors work well.  Really like it with the kaleidoscope stuff.<br />
Pillars of Thought - Looks awesome except for the lines going across the screen(you could probably just increase the camera distance a little to fix them).<br />
Your Typical Oscilliscope - Really nice looking.  Try adding some horizontal and vertical movement to make it a bit more interesting.<br />
Randomly Walking - Very nice effects, and is interesting.<br />
Polygons - Would be better if it slowly changed the number of sides, but that is difficult to code.  Nothing amazing, but I do like the fill.<br />
Liquefy - Colors get kinda weird looking sometimes, but it's a nice flow preset.<br />
Dot Warpin' - Is very interesting to watch.  Quick preset and looks nice.<br />
Back To MP - Edges get a little nasty at times, but very nice beat responsive preset.<br />
Containment - Weird movement with the MP's - I like it.  Also a nice trail effect.<br />
Interaction - Looks like the same movement of the particle in Containment, but in 3D.  Like the flashing sides.<br />
System - Very interesting with some cool fake 3D stuff.<br />
Bass Spin - Don't like.  The Bass Spin is one of the worst effects in AVS(IMO).<br />
Zero Render - Don't really like the moving/shaking, but I do like the getspec movement.<br />
Intro Pack 6 - Why is this at the end?:p  &quot;See you in Â±4 months???  So you will release the seventh pack sometime in between four months ago and four months from now?:p   Also, not all of the beams are shooting off correctly(like the top right of the 'C').<br />
<br />
Overall:4.0.  Excellent pack.  Cut down on the Channel Shift use though.  Can't wait for the seventh pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">apparently i've started a trend with my style of reviewing. Anubis has already got here so i'll do a small one for you.<br />
<br />
Wow, there are some amazing presets in here. There is some *real* eye candy in here to chew on, but there are some presets that just seem, rushed to me. Like you worked real hard on about half the pack and then just let it slide towards the end. Some presets didnt even show up properly for me. You maybe should've held out a little longer to make the pack more complete because the presets that are good, are amazing but they're brought down by some of the others. Example, my favroutes were the intro and snowflakes but particle cube was boring and just showed a white blob for me until about 15 seconds in when a vague cube shape appeared, i really liked the remix though. Like i say there are some amazing presets though. Great job and well done for them :up: 4.3/5.0 oh yeah one last thing, you need to chill with the channel shift, its not a good effect when its on almost every preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Raz, I've been doing huge ass reviews since before you.  I even bolded the titles before you.  I just started using the red text at the end, although I used to give an overall rating as well.  Don't like rating each preset though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 20:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Hehe, this is my fat ass review :) ( raz and anubis,learn smth from this heheh)<br />
<br />
So lets begin :<br />
<br />
A Mere Grid - colors very nice and the dm is quite cool.The wrap function does some pretty ugly edges here but if you disable you`ll see it looks better. 4.2/5<br />
Shine - looks like a worms preset ;) Looks pretty nice but could be better,a rotating/zooming DM could help. 4/5<br />
The Core - a circle with a wave DM and a color scope :) Looks nice but its a bit slow(like in not dynamic) even without the custom BPM. 3.8/5<br />
Shine Oozic Remix - looks better then the other one.The channel shift aint such a good choice here,a scope with some good colour code would be better. 4.3/5<br />
Comatose Gone Mad - water + rotoblitter :D I really dont like those colours much but the shine they have is very nice. 3.7/5<br />
Particle Cube - quite sweet but it would look better if the dots would have some colour :)<br />
 Also try optimize it a bit more,it is SLOW. 4.2/5<br />
TextureCube Mix - same as the last one only with stronger colours.Like it more. 4.5/5<br />
Swirling Mass - eye candy :D looks like shine only with other colours and other movement.<br />
Still it looks nice. 4/5<br />
Oldskool Stuff - pretty cool but...but...you get bored after 10-20 seconds :) The color <br />
 effect in the background is cool. 3.7/5<br />
Nuclear - Too damn bright ! Not a good preset to watch at night ;) Again i can see the <br />
 channel shift in action. Like raz and anubis  said you used it a bit too much. 3.5/5<br />
The Snowflakes - best snowflakes i`ve seen yet :) Good job, it looks good and the trail <br />
they leave behind is very cool. 4.7/5<br />
Codeless Warping - pretty cool, has nice effect and it can hypnotise you,kinda.The colours <br />
are again TOO bright :)  3.5/5<br />
Floating Lines - hacked snowflakes :D looks like UnConeD`s insane architect preset a bit <br />
and i just love that effect in the background.Channel shift again...hah  4.5/5<br />
Alpha Core - nice alpha blending :) Looks like fsk`s pickin dim 3 presets in the first part.Congrats on the sigmoid :D 4.2/5<br />
Sea Of Colors 2 - aint gonna say nothing about brightness ;) Its quite relaxing and nice.<br />
 The flow dynamove is very good.Oh and the cartoon version looks like crap and the  kaleidoscopic one is pretty cool. 4.1/5<br />
Pillars Of Thought - Nice scopes ! This preset looks very good(well a little too blurred) and it reacts great to bass :) Good one. 4.6/5<br />
Your Typical Oscilloscope - i really like cartoon like presets so im gonna give this one a full 5 stars cause i just LOVE it :) Btw what song ??? You are a singer ? Or you just shout in the mic then add some computer effects ? :D<br />
Randomly Walking - quite sweet...seems like many people these days do random movement scopes, so i must make one too :P The blending is pretty nice and really works here. 4.4/5<br />
Polygons - hahha,great idea :) love this one, looks cool. 4.8/5<br />
Liquefy - Woohoo ! Channel shift ! The green version is pretty afwul...This preset requires some more work and you can make it a 5 star one. 4/5<br />
Dot Warpin - SWEEEEEET ! Texer really shows its &quot;skills&quot; here :)  Oh and the SSC is very cool. 4.6/5<br />
Back To MP - hehe,nice idea :) Looks like a canvas sometimes. 4/5<br />
Containment - Worm preset ? Tugg had one a few months ago ( january if i can remember right) and it looked very similar to this.Its pretty nice but the other colour versions except that green kinda destroy it... 3.7/5<br />
Interaction - eye candy again :) Good looks but the interaction isnt that good...Needs (even) more coding. :D 4.4/5<br />
System - a bit chaotic but it`s OK.What dont you understand about raytracing ? I thought you know it...3.6/5<br />
Bass Spin - heh, good use of the bass spin :) (which really should be erased from Render or replaced with a more advanced and customizable one).Love that cartoon look :) 4.1/5<br />
Zero Render - you showed me the uglier version some time ago and you really made this one look great.A bit slow but its cool. 4/5<br />
Intro - this should be Outro...:D Great coding and those rays looks very good but they arent quite well coordinated.There are 2 rays that arent put corectly in the picture :) 4.7/5<br />
 <br />
Overall pack rating -&gt; 4.4/5...neah! 4.5/5 cause i know you :P I hope you`ll submit it to the winamp staff cause its great and should be shared with everyone not just the DA and winamp`s AVS forums community. <br />
Main bug - channel shift,which ruins some presets with the<br />
other color schemes.Great job, i hope in 3(not 4) months i`ll see the Nic01 Going Higher (nice name eh?) pack :D<br />

<div class="posttext">yeah well, mine are more detailed, contain suggestions, almost perfect grammer and spelling and almost no emoticons for easy to read-ness and i wrote them so obviously im going to think they're great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 21:09</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">but you spend 1 hour at least and i did it in 30 minutes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">24th March 2003, 21:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yah well, i dont mind spending an hour on making my review more helpful, what would you prefer. Something done in half and hour hardly readable and not much help or something with suggestions, clear and concise in an hour, and don't say the half hour one you know the answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">And another thread goes offtopic.  Enough talking about who makes better reviews.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This isn't a reviewing contest, it's giving someone feedback on their presets. I just happen to not mind giving them a lot of feedback.<br />
<br />
Moving back on topic...<br />
Nic, cant wait to see 07, I thought these presets rocked but you put them down. I expect 07 will be really something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i hate you nic...you're so much better than me :( ;)<br />
Here goes...<br />
<br />
A Mere Grid - Nice movement, but there's these strange lines across the edges.  I *think* this has to do with you mirroring the image in the DM and not beforehand.  If you did that asin(sin()) thing in a static movement before the DM I think it'd fix it.  Also, is it just me, or is the texture coloring a bit too similar to the textrure you did in your remix of Plad? ;) 8/10<br />
Shine! - Very nice, but those particles should rotate.  8.5/10<br />
The Core - A bit too bright, and too centered.  Maybe make the scope move and the dynamove's center with it?  Just a little bit tho...nothing drastic.  8/10<br />
Shine! - Oozic remix - Don't think I like the black bands in this one very much :/ I think just a regular outline filter (ala Cartoon Trip) would work better.  6/10<br />
Comatose Gone Mad - I REALLY like the effect in this one, but the coloring isn't too great imho.  I like it with a subblend on the last buffer save better.  Picked it apart a little...now I'm wondering how the fuck you did it....  8.5/10<br />
Particle Cube - Don't like this one too much.  Pretty, but not very reactive.  Too slow too...especially coming from you :/ 6.5/10<br />
Texercube Mix - Same as the original...not very reactive and rather slow.  6.5/10<br />
Swirling Mass - DAMMIT I wish I could do presets like this :( Very excellent, nic....  9/10<br />
Oldskool Stuff - Nice effect, tho the scope in the center could use a little improvement.  7.5/10<br />
Nuclear - I liked the core better...this is kind of grainy and the bouncing is really repetitive and distracting.  And what's with your DM that says &quot;d=d1&quot;?  I want the story behind that one...;) 7/10<br />
Snowflakes - Don't like the in-out-in-out-in-out of the coloring, and the snowflakes seem to come out of nowhere (can be fixed by setting it to wrap from -1.2 to 1.2 or something).  Might want to add some actual &quot;wind&quot; somehow...otherwise this is a great effect, you didn't really need to go much farther with the snowflake imho :) I'm guessing you used an l-system or something?  Anyway...cool preset.  8.5/10<br />
Codeless Warping - Could've made this entirely codeless by using a series of effect lists and mirrors :) Pretty cool effect here, nontheless.  8.5/10<br />
Floating Lines - Mmmm...I think the movement should be a little more random than sinusoidal.  Great effect tho.  8.5/10<br />
Alphacore - Too soft for beat-y music, too &quot;jolting&quot; for soft music.  Looks very nice...but I can't figure out what to listen to with it :p 8.5/10<br />
Sea of Colors - Ooooh...ahhh...I love it :D Just a bit too bright for my taste though.  9/10<br />
Pillars of Thought - Great scopes, I get the feeling you couldn't figure out what to do with them tho....  7.5/10<br />
Your Typical Oscilloscope - I like what you did with the scope a lot, and the movement's nice, but it keeps warping in the corners.  8/10<br />
Randomly Walking - Nice, but there's that same asin(sin()) problem as before, and the foreground DM needs to wrap further.  BTW, a true random walk is defined as a walk in which every step is of gaussian random distance from the previous and a random angle :) 7.5/10<br />
Polygons - Okay, let me rephrase that: I CAN make presets like this, I just wish I got as many ideas as you do...  9/10<br />
Liquefy - Odd...very S_KuPeRS/Degnicish.  8.5/10<br />
Dot Warpin' - Nice...this could go places...not much of anything atm tho :/ 7.5/5<br />
Back to MP - Very cool :D Try the conv. filter on absolute.  8.5/10<br />
Containment - Very, very cool :D 9/10<br />
Interaction - Dammit nic, I had this really cool idea for a preset...and here you come along and do it first :p 8.5/10<br />
System - Augh...this is too much... 9.5/10<br />
Bass Spin - Now THAT'S cool.  Once again, I'm wondering how you did it...<br />
Zero Render - Doesn't count cos you used the colormap like a clear screen :) Pretty cool lookin tho.  8/10<br />
INTRO PACK 6 - ...Why is this the last thing in the pack...?  Number them dammit :p And use NSIS...in any case...this r4wkz :D:D:D 9/10<br />
<br />
OVERALL - Great pack, but some could use a little work.  Get an NSIS installer (I'll do one for you if you'd like).  8/10<br />
<br />
<br />
that was painful...</div></div><hr />
