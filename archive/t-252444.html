			<strong>An AVS pack</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		Been here a few times over the years, posted a pack or two.<br />
I'm not that into code like some so these are mostly pretty 2d things with simple scopes.<br />
<br />
Some of these I might have posted a previous form of, but that was years ago. I've been tweaking them and making new stuff occationally since then.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!

		Haven't heard anyone use the singular of dice in a long while. Even heard &quot;roll the dice&quot; when there's only one.:igor: <br />
<br />
I liked Vapour Trek, but I have to see the pack again on a faster computer than this Celeron 300A I'm using right now.

		mmmh, very nice things to watch!<br />
<br />
my favourite one was &quot;labrynth&quot; [typo?]. somehow i find the colors to go just great with this psycho i'm-inside-my-pc-trip look!!<br />
closely followed by &quot;blaze ball&quot; [looks just fine, only needs less darkness or a background] and &quot;emerald silver&quot;. the latter seems pretty loaded in the editor and runs very slowly. too bad, cause the look is nice.<br />
<br />
keep them coming!<br />

		Allright, I'll be back in a few years, hah.<br />
E S has actually been sped up alot, it used to be gold and the shape was rendered twice. It could do with a different fill. Remix anyone?
