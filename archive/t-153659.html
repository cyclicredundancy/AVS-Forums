			<strong>scope ghost</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm new to AVS.  The forums have been great help so far but I can't find an answer to the following question.  I was wondering if one could get a blur effect without actually rendering the object that creates the blur.  In other words I'd like to render the blur of a line or dot without actually showing the line or dot that created the blur.  This way I could create a &quot;ghost&quot; of a scope.

		Some buffer tricks might be the only way I could think of doing it. I don't know how you could do it exactly, I'll look into making something though...

		i am not catching your drift<br />
<br />
edit: maybe i got it.  perhaps changing the colors to get a white dot or line on 1 frame, to get the blur, then the render goes back to black...

		so you want the blur risidual but you don't want to see any of the render?<br />
<br />
The only way I think of doing is having a bunch code &amp; some trick with an on beat effect list most likely.<br />
<br />
You're best bet is to just really blur out with the Convo filter. something like:<br />
    1<br />
  1 0 1<br />
1 0 8 0 1<br />
  1 0 1<br />
    1<br />
<br />
base 16 or whatever.

		fix on the convo:<br />
<br />
----1----<br />
--1-0-1--<br />
1-0-8-0-1<br />
--1-0-1--<br />
----1----

		if you're able to write your blur in a DM, you can do it with buffers.

		Deamon: this might work if there would'nt be the grid size problem.

		something like<br />
<br />
-scope<br />
-buffer save<br />
-blur effects<br />
-effect list (ignore/minimum)<br />
---clear screen (white)<br />
---effect list (ignore/buffer blend) <br />
-----clear screen (black)<br />
<br />
would also work.. you would need to play around with it. I havnt tried the above example yet.<br />

		Toying with the convo filter seems the best bet for getting the effect I was after(thanks Nemo).  Sidddhartha your idea makes a great looking smoky sort of a scope but it didn't quite get rid of the distinct dots of the scope render. Maybe I can tweak it somehow. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions.  I'm impressed by the quality of this community.

		Emphasis on <i>this</i>.  If its quality you want, steer well away of General Discussions and the Recycle Bin.

		General Discusion is terrible, that is for sure. Now the recylce bin is another story! Great things happen their like, the ANGEL AVATAR CLUB! Check my signature for a link to join, and if you sign up now it's 100% free after three easy payments of nothing! I am glad you like it here in the AVS fourms though, it is probably the best one out there. I'll be looking forward to the presets you post here.

		umm...so...basically all you want to do is render the blur but not the object.<br />
<br />
sorry bud, isn't possible.  only thing that'd come close to what you're thinking of is putting the blur after the object, or texering it to something blurry before you started the blurring.
