      <p class="post-content"><strong>First vis pack - need feedback</strong><br />
      Ok, this is my first set of visuals and I'd like some feedback.<br />
      <br />
      The rotation matrix in some of the scopes I stole from PAK_9's tutorial, other than that everything is original.<br />
      <br />
      Some of the presets will look the same and will only have minor variations from one to another. I couldn't decide which one I liked more so I threw them all in.<br />
      <br />
      Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tip: use Set render mode before a texer and set the output mode to maximum blend or something like that. It looks much better.<br />
      The 3d superscopes you've used look more like flat plates rotated in all the 3 dimensions. Many of the presets are basically the same, with minor differences.<br />
      Finally, in the .zip file specify a path.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I'm still workin on the 3d scope itself. I have no clue how to do that though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd just like to say for the record that noone needs to credit me for stuff they took from my tutorial, its there to be used however people want. If you want to credit me its fine but just dont feel obliged.</p>
