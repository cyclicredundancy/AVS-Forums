      <p class="post-content">awesome.. just amazing!<br />
      <br />
      this was the most amazingly apt place to post this thread!!!!<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      er..With the thing you asked..<br />
      <br />
      If you just want the red ones to weave in and out of the blue ones, then all you need to do is use three layers: blue stripes &lt; red stripes &lt; more blue strips. in that order.<br />
      <br />
      That would make it look like your wallpaper.<br />
      <br />
      But, if you wanted to make the blue ones weave aswell (so it would looks like the weaving on a straw hat for example), you would need to get much trikier. I cant think of a simple way to do it :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">I havent looked at the attachment but I would suggest skip. i.e. n=10, pixel: blank=bnot(blank);skip=blank; ... something like that, then you can extend that to weaving them in and out of each other by skipping every 3, point=(point+1)%3;skip=bnot(point); ... thats really badly explained sorry but I think u get the idea.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This sin't exactly the place for preset help, this more of troubleshooting and posts like<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        OMFG MY AVS IS TEH FUCKORZ!@!@!!!@# WHAT WRONG WIT IT??!@&gt;
      </blockquote>It would probably do better in the AVS presets subforum, since thats were most usually post presets to get advice/help.
