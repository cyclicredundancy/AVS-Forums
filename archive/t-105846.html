      <p class="post-content">Aaaargh...<br />
      <br />
      Stop. Please.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You've seen AVS packs. You noticed the cool presets tons of people made. And you found out you can make your own. And now you're going to do exactly and submit them to this website.<br />
      <br />
      The result? You'll get cracked down and get a nice 3 star rating (the reviewers don't give out zeroes) because the things you consider special and cool have little meaning to someone who's seen a lot more presets than you.<br />
      <br />
      My advice: enjoy making presets and practice making them. Try to experiment and create new effects, but you won't learn everything in 1 day. When you think what you've created is realllllly good, post it here and we'll give you advice.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If you think "what the hell is he talking about?", here's what I mean. Fire up AVS, create a preset. Add a "Render / Ring", a "Trans / Blitter Feedback" and a "Trans / Water". Whoa! A cool, psychedelic tunnel! How cool!<br />
      Now if you save that and submit it, almost no-one will consider it cool, because it's so darn easy and everyone's seen it before.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In any case, I wish you welcome to the AVS community and hope you stay, but I'd hate to see you make the same mistake as most newbies: to rush in and create stuff that they themselves will think is horrible 3 weeks later. And this counts for *every* online publishing community... take for example Quake skins: someone fires up photoshop, recolors a standard skin to be cyan-blue and submits is as a 'cool plasma armor!'. If everyone does this, those cool custom skins that hours were spent on will be lost between a mass of crap.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      As for your original question, it doesn't really matter. If your presets are very unique, you'll probably make 10-15 presets. Or you might do a lot of variations on the same thing and get 30 presets.<br />
      Just remember it's not the quantity (there are already thousands of presets), but the quality.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah. Like what he said.<br />
      <br />
      Take your time to fully explore AVS before releasing anything. As to the maths, there's a whole whack of related links in the FAQ (sticky thread at the top of the forum).<br />
      <br />
      As to pack size, I'm shooting for 12 originals for my next pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thought i'd better make a decent reply to this post...<br />
      <br />
      i have used 10-20 presets in each of my packs, usually by making about 40 then picking the best out of them.<br />
      <br />
      also i recommend that you search the forums for help on superscope about a million people have asked that question before, you should find some answers. if you cant find them then try this in superscope:<br />
      <br />
      x=2*i-1;<br />
      y=v;<br />
      <br />
      that is the tutorial i had... now i can make spinning 3d geometry.(see avatar)<br />
      <br />
      have fun making avs.</p>
