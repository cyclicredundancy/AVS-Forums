<div class="posttext">Holy crap, it's been a while. The last time I was even remotely involved with AVS, I was in high school. I'm glad to see that it's not dead. <br />
<br />
Updates! I am now a Mathematics and Computer Science double major at Fordham University, transferring to Columbia, and I'm looking for hax to work on. Why? Cuz I have to take humanities courses to fulfill my core and I'm bored...:(<br />
<br />
I've been working on parallel computation, using nVidia's CUDA system, and hopefully on OpenCL once it comes out on something other than Snow Leopard. I was thinking that there are concrete optimizations that could be put in place in some areas, specifically the Superscope and Dynamic Motion. <br />
<br />
Obviously, the downside is that you need to have a decent graphics card, although as time goes by more and more computers with these things are rolling out. The way I see it, the bulk of the operations will still be performed by the CPU, but some things can easily be offloaded. <br />
<br />
So yeah, what's new, and what do you think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I really don't give a fuck how much you've advanced in life tbh.<br />
<br />
AVS is dead. There's nothing you or anyone else can do to revilitalize it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">thousands of people still play NES, and listen to vinyl.<br />
nothing really dies, it just becomes obsolete.</div></div><hr />

wanna take advantage of your GPU?<br />
Maybe Pixelshader programming with Milkdrop (http://dev.winamp.com/wiki/MilkDrop_Preset_Authoring#PIXEL_SHADERS) is interesting for you ;)</div></div><hr />
