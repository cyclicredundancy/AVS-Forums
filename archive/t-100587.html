You can always use Minimalistic Nothingness for relaxing presets, but even then, beats are needed...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think most people use techno styles because of the nice clear beats. Personally, i like to expose my presets to as much as possible.<br />
<br />
I listen to a lot of metal, though, so in the end my presets probably seem a bit unresponsive to some people.<br />
<br />
In the end i'd have to say the music that really shows me what my presets can do is a short assortment of Led Zepellin tracks. Almost any of them will do. I think it's something to do with how they're recorded or something because they just work. I don't know why. Tool is pretty good too, especiallly if you want to test a range of volumes, big crescendos, combined with subtle moments.<br />
<br />
A bit of folk is surprisingly good, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I basically creat emy presets based on what looks good when it reacts to what's currently on. THat's how most of mine were done, especially some of my very early presets (except for the &quot;Transitions Intro&quot; AVS, which was inspired by work done by Jaheckelsafar - and I credited him for his isnpiration).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the best way in my opinion since you can see how it reacts to different types of music. I also like to make mine do something to nothing I often test my presets with no music too just to make sure that they wont look like cack with calmer or quiet tracks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No as I said, it's really the subliminal messaging which does the trick.<br />
<br />
Try searching WinMX for &quot;I Love Techno&quot; (a large techno event in Belgium). You should be able to locate some DJ sets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It depends on how I feel<br />
<br />
When I really try to make a beautiful preset i use something with a loud, constant beat such as Darude, but Darude is way too commercial for me. Otherwise i play the music i like such as Metallica, Nirvana or KoRn.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but you'd need to use superliminal messaging to work on me.</div></div><hr />
