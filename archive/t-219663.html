      <p class="post-content"><strong>No Signal AVS on Fullscreen Mode</strong><br />
      New Media Center Computer works good except...<br />
      <br />
      I have NVIDIA 256MB Video card, when I switch to full-screen mode in AVS, the monitor says "No Signal" and the screen goes blank.<br />
      <br />
      When I hit ESC (presuming exiting fullscreen mode), I get back to my normal screen...<br />
      <br />
      Couldn't find the answer by searching..<br />
      <br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">So you have a TFT now? I don't have one myself, but as i understand TFT's have trouble viewing other resolutions than what they were build for (the so called "native" resolution), so the problem might be just that. What your gfx card is should not matter at all.<br />
      Pixel doubling for 1024x768 should work too and you can try checking "Use fullscreen overlay mode" in the Settings -&gt; Fullscreen options.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have DVI going into a DVI input monitor.<br />
      <br />
      Max resolution is the 1024 X 728.<br />
      <br />
      When I go into fullscreen mode it goes fine now. But when I try to get out it takes a few seconds to switch back.<br />
      <br />
      It's definitely slower than with a traditional CRT/Analog output.</p>

      <p class="post-content">most TFTs dont support more than 75 Hz, some only support 60 Hz. you have probably set your graphics driver to "override refresh rates"<br />
      you should disable that and try again<br />
      <br />
      if you dont know what i'm talking about try this:<br />
      can you play older direct3d/opengl games in 1024x768 resolution? half-life (or any of its mods) for example</p>
