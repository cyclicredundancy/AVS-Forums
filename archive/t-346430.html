<div class="posttext">Hello there.<br />
<br />
I'm a DSP developer and I found the source of the AVS dll. I wonder If there's documentation about how can it be hosted in another application (not winamp).<br />
<br />
I checked the source code and I saw the winampVisGetHeader() I must call, and more stuff. I suppose I would go through this through trial and error, but I 'd like a more practical documentation so I could use the DLL myself.<br />
<br />
Best Regards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hehe so would we all. No sorry, there isn't any.<br />
<br />
I'm not a programmer at all, but I've seen experienced programmers to call it wizardry</div></div><hr />

They are searched professional programmers for participation in nonprofit art-project of interactive visualizations (no marker seizure) of the moving (motion detection for live video) and musics (audio detection for live sound). The Technical requirement: Design software AVSMmP (AVS Multimedia Player) or plug-in, similarly existing plug-in [vis_avs.dll] of visualizations studio AVS WinAMP (Advanced Visualisation Studio by Nullsoft). Player\plagin must support the active AVS code and all types of already existing avs-preset, but must have herewith advanced user interface, new function on preset processing, new possibilities &quot;alive&quot; sound detection since mike and &quot;alive&quot; video detection since web-cameras. For player advisable cross-platform provision, and for plagin desirably ensuring to compatibility with different player. For base of application is offered AVS Nullsoft programme code (source code).<br />
<br />
AVS TROUBLESHOOTING<br />
<br />
 Sound and Visualization management are on different consoles.<br />
 The interface compatibility is not provided.<br />
 M3U and APL playlists Synchronization is not possible.<br />
 Start the avs-file from Windows Explorer is impossible.<br />
 Presets in Explorer are not visually represented.<br />
 Open the presets from the visualization studio window very difficult.<br />
 Presets sort in directories is not possible.<br />
 When you configure the &quot;Presets/Hotkeys: Preset (sub) directory&quot;, folders are not sorted by the tree.<br />
 By default &quot;Vertical screen height to render (percent): 80%&quot; nothing is not conditioned.<br />
 By default &quot;Fullscreen Settings: Fullscreen video mode&quot; is not optimized.<br />
 Many of the video mode become unstable or lead to system failures.<br />
 Switching on the second monitor is not provided.<br />
 Screen saver and screen blanking not blocked.<br />
 Even &quot;empty&quot; presets, providing fps&lt;60, give almost 100% CPU utilization.<br />
 Refresh rate more 30 fps, in principle, does not make sense for visual perception.<br />
 Presets editing is difficult, the editor font is very small, the size of the windows are not regulated.<br />
 On the start editing effects, all Effect list are open, which is inconvenient for the review.<br />
 Key &quot;del&quot; in the effects editing are not involved.<br />
 When you insert a Effect list, options Clear and Blending is not preinstalled.<br />
 Rollback is only valid with restrictions.<br />
 Autosave is not provided.<br />
 Can only be one and only one-dimensional array.<br />
 Characters positioning in the Text output effect is not programmed.<br />
 Text moving via Dynamic Movement gives a greater load on the processor.<br />
 Work with web-cam is not provided.<br />
