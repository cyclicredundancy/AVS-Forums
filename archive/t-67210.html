			<strong>neat</strong><br />
		
		

		its pretty cool..   but i think its a little slow.<br />
averaged 10fps on my system at 640x480, P4 - 1.4ghz, 512mb RAM<br />
<br />
maybe remove a few effects that dont effect the overall AVS to much, to improve impromance.  otherwise I like it.

			<strong>Low-resolution</strong><br />
		
		

		Don't expect to gain lots of FPS at that resolution. I usually tune my AVS'es to get at least 10fps @ 320x240 on my P2-350... but when you create complex presets it's simply not possible. The trade-off between cool effect and fast preset is hard, but there's enough boring and fast stuff out there already.

			<strong>opinion</strong><br />
		
		

		I think it's pretty neat. Though, I thought that it was a bit bright, so I added a color clip that changes color 255,255,255 to 128,128,128- for the &quot;near&quot; selection (set a bit less than half).

		Something strang is going on...<br />
<br />
It uns at about 27 fps on my 333MHZ pc... but it does has 1GB RAM and it's a dual thingamagig, but it's still crap.<br />
<br />
Plus, I just lost all my Presets... All ready to go online... there were hundereds of them! Now I have to start all over again!:cry:
