      Ok this should be a surprise!Ive created a preset, that you dont watch! Anyone who gets really stoned knows that too much light can suck, but not enough lights sucks too, so the point of this preset is too leave it on while your listening to music and sparking up and it will create a nice "mellow blue" hue to the room, just right too sooth your redened eyes... then when desired baked-ness is acheived you throw on all those great presets from everyone else in the avs community and kick back.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      P.S. the truth is that i think i just figured out buffers and effect lists and this was a successful test.<br />
      <br />
      P.P.S. I know this preset could have been created more efficiently but<br />
      that wasn't the point.<br />
      (rename to .avs)(BTW- if you think renaming is harder than unziping see the last two posts of this thread: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=86499" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....threadid=86499</a> )</p>
