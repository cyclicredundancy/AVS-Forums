      <br />
      aight.. this problem is kinda hard to describe... aight.. i really really really dont understand half of the values you can do.. so i probably just over looked it.. i just started messin with it &lt; ty unconed for your detailed instructions !!!! &gt; and im a complete nEwBiE! so.. plz.. bear with me here. i really would like to get a circle, that around the ring has beat detection &lt; variable would be a v &gt; and have the whole circle like dance around on the screen zooming in and out based on the beat. the circle itself will shrink and grow on beat as well. i would like the circle's position to move around randomly &lt;&lt; most likely by way of beat detection since thats the only real variable availabe cuz math is too cut and dry to make a variable, i think &gt;&gt; ... so..... is there any one that can help me at all? i mean completely explain in NeWbIe terms? i got the idea kinda from making some other crazy @$$ presets without superscope, and they werent random enough for me.. then i saw what el.vis's preset zero-g did... the floating circles with the crazy background.. i liked that, /me gives props to el.vis for that!.. but anywayz.. i have no F###ing clue on the math.. i mean.. i do.. i think.. kinda... see what i mean? sooooooo.... if anyone could help me out on this problem.. even if not solving it.. if you just explain what every variable does.. it would really really really help me out.. cuz like.. ima dumba##.... so yeah....plz plz plz plz help me!:cry: :cry: :cry: :( :igor: :igor: :cry: :cry: :cry: :cry:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ugh, n00b-ism taken to a new level... ouch...<br />
      <br />
      First of all, don't post like that - I can barely read anything... It looks like a very complicated code - You look at it, letters everywhere compact together, you decide not to read it.<br />
      <br />
      _________________<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      First of all, the step that you've done, go to the FAQ.<br />
      <br />
      Second, learn the math! It's better to screw around knowing the math than not knowing it.<br />
      <br />
      Third, Apply the math! If needed, use a graphics calculator to "practice"!<br />
      <br />
      Fourth, If you haven't, make your own SSCs. It's simpler than you think.<br />
      <br />
      Fifth, Study from other artists' SSC! Don't panic at the first sight - Break the code piece by piece - if needed, copy and paste into a notepad.<br />
      Look at it carefully, study it, use your new knowledge.<br />
      <br />
      Sixth, Ask the forum members - Not on "How to make SSC?" but on "How do I make an SSC do ______?" - Make sure you fill in the blank not with something simple :p<br />
      <br />
      Tips :<br />
      <br />
      -If you want to go 3D right away, download El-Vis's 6th pack - contains a 3D SSC guide. Search for "El-Vis" on plugins to find it.<br />
      <br />
      -Since you're in early stages of AVS... Post your presets here - Then we can see what you can and can't do, and we then can give you tips.<br />
      <br />
      -<br />
      <br />
      -<br />
      <br />
      BTW, what level of Math have ya learned?</p>

      aight.. if ya not going to post something important plz.. plz pzl plz.. to keep flaming down adn to keep me from getting even more discouraged.. just dont post. ty.. i mean.. half those things you said.. i have done, which if you even read half of what i said in the previous 2 posts in this thread you would know by now that i did check the faq and i did ask a specific question, as in how do i get the ring to do such and such.. so.. plz.. dont say anything unless you fully understand what i was saying.... and i dont know what arccosine and all that means.. i tried to check out a trig book, which i mentioned in a previous post in THIS thread... so.. before you start listing things I need to do.. plz.. take the time to fully read and comprehend the things i am posting.. ty.<br />

      I'm going to patent my new, revolutionary technology, called .... *drum roll* Paragraphs(tm)!<br />
      <br />
      The reason we only read half of your post is because that's how much we can read before getting a headache. Well I don't know about the others, but that's true for me. Just read it yourself! How do you expect others to be friendly and helpful, when you're giving them every reason not to be?<br />
      <br />
      In fact, it looks like *you're* the one not reading other people's posts. Nic01 said:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        First of all, the step that you've done, go to the FAQ.
      </blockquote>He acknowledges that you've read the FAQ, yet you say:<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        if you even read half of what i said in the previous 2 posts in this thread you would know by now that i did check the faq
      </blockquote>And just look at this:<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        but anywayz.. i have no F###ing clue on the math.. i mean.. i do.. i think.. kinda... see what i mean?
      </blockquote>How do you expect us to know what you're saying, when you don't seem to know yourself?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      We're not a secret club who hate newbies... we try to help you, point you to *existing* resources, and all you say is "I don't understand! Explain it to me again! Personally!". Sounds to me like you're simply trying to learn too much at a time. There's tons of nice guides peppered around the forums that you can usually locate with the search feature. If you don't know the maths, sorry, but that's not something you learn in 1 day. Most of the people here have been creating presets for many months, some for more than a year.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and I fail to see where Nic01 was flaming you: he simply pointed out that your post was hard on the eyes, and then proceeded with a *very clear* helpful answer. It seems you only replied to the initial 3 lines and ignored all the rest.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>please note</strong><br />
      FrYnTeHkReW, you can make up and use almost any variable that you want. Except the few that are mentioned in the text in the superscope window:<br />
      <br />
      "x and y are the coordinates to draw, i is the position of the scope, v is the value at that point, b is 1 if beat, red, green, and blue are all 0-1, w and h are the width and height, in pixels".<br />
      <br />
      Those variables are what makes the superscope. Any other variable you see (such as pi, dx, tri, ry, wakka, etc) is one that was made up. They just hold a number.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry guys.....</strong><br />
      its just that i was up for about 2 days figuring out what to do with this circle.. if i seem a lil bitchy.. plz.. just dont mind it.. ill see if i can explain a lil better..<br />
      <br />
      ok.. meh problem is this.. i havent taken trig.. i did however take geometry &lt; i know.. laugh come on, you know you want to ;]~ &gt; so when i see cosine and those other things like that, im not sure what exactly those variables mean. i know what x y i v b h w all mean. ive read that thread and have it bookmarked. that was very helpful to me. thank you unconed for giving us all that detailed explanation about superscopes.<br />
      <br />
      so. now that i figured out how to make a circle and got the whole circle to have beat detection, ive been wanting to make the circle itself move around the screen, rather than staying stationary in the middle of the screen. thats the problem ive been wanting to figure out.. and i dont know how to do that.. cuz i suck at math.. thats what this whole thread is about.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      im not trying to piss anyone off .. i am a nOob so i dont know exactly how to explain all this yet..<br />
      <br />
      i did read a couple other faq's as well. they showed me how to get a single line to move back and forth along the x axis and have y move to beat detection.. i was successfully able to get it to flip around and stay within the boundaries of the screen.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      this is the whole reason for this thread:<br />
      <br />
      so how am i supposed to get a circle to move around the screen &lt; randomly &gt; ???????????<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">You just need to know how to move things?<br />
      <br />
      It's<br />
      <br />
      x = xvalue + xmoveamt<br />
      y = yvalue + ymoveamt<br />
      <br />
      then you chage how much you change xmoveamt and ymoveamt by. Kinda like:<br />
      <br />
      aa=aa+.1;<br />
      a=sin(a)<br />
      xmoveamt=a*.02</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>SSC movements</strong><br />
      Ahhh... glad those crying smilies are gone.<br />
      Now that you've calmed down quite a bit, I think I can help you more.<br />
      <br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      SSC Movements<br />
      <br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      Back and forth :<br />
      <br />
      Frame : t=t+0.05 (Or 0.1) &lt;-- Speed of movement. Higher = quicker<br />
      Pixel :<br />
      x=xcode (Shaping code)<br />
      y=ycode<br />
      <br />
      To move them, add to the x's or y's line "sin(t)" or "cos(t)" - This moves them back and forth.<br />
      Use both sin or cos in both lines for diagonal<br />
      Use sin in one line and cos in the other for circular movement<br />
      Use *(number) to determine the size of the movement area.<br />
      You can use different variable for the sin or cos function for different movement - just remember to include it in the per-frame area and the "speed" of movement.<br />
      <br />
      For OnBeat change :<br />
      <br />
      Beat : t1=rand(101)/1000-rand(101)/1000 &lt;-- Remember what I said in my last post : Take it step by step to understand this.<br />
      Frame : t=t+t1<br />
      <br />
      For pixel, use the same movement code.<br />
      It's not smooth, I know :(<br />
      Just like the linear movement, you can use different variables - this time, also remember the OnBeat part =)<br />
      <br />
      For more things, you can either ask it here (Faster answers, more likely) Or PM one of us (Private messaging) - You know how to do it dontya? :)<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully, you'll develop to a good - I mean, great AVS artist.<br />
      When will it happen? Time will tell...<br />
      <br />
      And to end the reply, the phrase that is used a lot - Good Luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>omfg... almost there!!!!!!!!!!</strong><br />
      omfg... im really really really glad i posted something here.. jeebuz...<br />
      <br />
      ok.. check this out.. i have gotten close to where i need to be so far..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      bleh! ok, here is what i got so far, go ahead and plug it in and check it out.. its a lil crazy.. not what i want exactly but it will help ya understand &lt; possibly &gt; what im trying to do.. ;]~<br />
      <br />
      init: n= whatever you wanthere i have 200; tpi=acos(-1)*2; t=0<br />
      beat: p=rand(1)/1 ; c=rand(1)/1<br />
      per frame: t=t+.5*v; rad=.2;<br />
      per point:<br />
      x=(cos(t)*p)+(cos(i*tpi)*(rad+v/5));<br />
      y=(sin(t)*c)+(sin(i*tpi)*(rad+v/5))<br />
      <br />
      i like to keep things as neat and simple as possible ;]~ considering my handwriting is ghetto, i can keep the math here neat and tidy ;]~<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ok, so now your looking at a moving circle bouncing around on the screen randomly to the beat.. im trying to get that to be smooth, dunno if ill have that done by the next post or not.. but im working on it..<br />
      <br />
      i know that if i plug in a rad &lt; radius variable &gt; and have it tied to a random value &lt; such as rad=sin(t)/2+.05 (cuz will =t-.05 or something like that &gt; it will make the circle get bigger and smaller ;]~<br />
      <br />
      the thing with it is i want it to be smooth... what do i want smooth exaclty? well, the circle's placement on the screen..... grrr.. ok.. not explaining it well enough..<br />
      <br />
      when the circle moves from point a to random point b, i dont want it just jumping there, i want it to be moving in that direction.... i think i might have meh math a lil ghettofied, but im doing this all without the proper knowledge of trig.. so bear with meh hear.. i'm a nOob in every since of the werd, but i pick up extremely quick, and im creative<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      soooooo.. check it out, ima go have a smoke and continue with this madness ;]~ have fun with it guys, and ty for all the help ;]~</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hehhehehehe... another question for ya ;}</strong><br />
      okay... so i figured out that i can stick meh rad variable in the on beat area and take it out of the per frame and get a more randomized circle ;]~ hehehehehe... /me stares in aww ;]~... ok..<br />
      <br />
      now..meh next question/puzzle/sumfin-or-other is .. How now brown cow can i get the radius not to be smaller than a specific size.. i.e.: not bigger than a, but not smaller than b? such as i dont want the circle being smaller than say.. ohh .2<br />
      <br />
      how would i do that?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ill include what ive gotten so far.. albiet it aint much.. but ive been goofing off too ;]~ so i havent got much work done on it.. hehehe<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      init: n=200 ; tpi=acos(-1)*2 ; t=0<br />

      <br />
      rad=rand(4)/9 *note!---- here is where i am asking the question....<br />
      <br />
      per frame: t=t-.05*v;<br />
      <br />
      per point:<br />
      x=(cos(t)*p)+(cos(i*tpi)*(rad+v/4)) ;<br />

      <br />
      <br />
      ohh, make sure its not clearing every frame and drop in the fade out trans and set the fadeout to really slow... enjoy!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>rand(1)/1</strong><br />
      I noticed you used rand(1)/1... this is probably not doing what you want. Rand(a) returns an integer in the range 0...(a-1)<br />
      (a is not included, contrary to what the AVS help says). So when you use rand(1), it's always 0. And dividing by one won't do much either.<br />
      <br />
      So if you want a random number between 'a' and 'b', you use:<br />
      <br />
      somevar = rand(a-b) + a;<br />
      <br />
      First, we ask a number between 0 and a-b, and then add a. If you don't immediately see why, just think of an example. If we want a random number between 10 and 20, first we take a random number between 0 and 10. Then we add 10 to that number, and now we have a number between 10 and 20.<br />
      <br />
      The mathematical formulas might be confusing at first, but if you take them apart and fill in some example values, you'll see that it's not at all that complex. Play around with it and try new things.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and if you don't know trigonometry, I wrote a short explanation which covers the very basics a while ago. The link is in the FAQ. I'm not sure if it's clear enough for people who haven't had any trig, because it was mainly written as a quick refresher.</p>

      <blockquote>
        now..meh next question/puzzle/sumfin-or-other is .. How now brown cow can i get the radius not to be smaller than a specific size.. i.e.: not bigger than a, but not smaller than b? such as i dont want the circle being smaller than say.. ohh .2
      </blockquote>Off hand, I can think of two ways.<br />
      <br />
      1 - Use the sine of a number. Sacle it and shift it to corespond with your two end values.<br />
      2 - Use 2 if statements.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        when the circle moves from point a to random point b, i dont want it just jumping there, i want it to be moving in that direction....
      </blockquote>Just change your move value. Something like this<br />
      <br />
      x=x+((x-destx)/2);<br />
      <br />
      that will move x 1/2 the distance between where it currently is and where it is going. The down side is that it never actually gets there.

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry guys ;]~</strong><br />
      wellpppp... i havent really been doing much in the way of presets cuz ive been under alot of stress.. so i think im going to continue trying to make some.. i got a few more brain teasers though... these you should like ;]~<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ok.. here it is:<br />
      <br />
      i need to get the circle to be like say... like an egg.. kinda... but more like a skrewed up circle... say the middle of the circle is 0,0 on the grid right? ok.. take one point on the y axis and make it 0,.4 and another on the same y axis as 0,-.4 the x axis will have two points as well, those will be .8,0 and -.8,0 ... draw the circle now.. can you picture what i want at all?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ok now that you see what im going to be playing with... here is what i want it to do:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      i want like a continuous line comeing from every dot around the ring of the circle and i want it flowing upwards.. so that when the whole circle has it done it will kinda look like smoke..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      then i want to get the lines to move with the beat... jesus, this is where it will get hard to explain.. say a typical point on the circle makes a certain bounce to a specific height... when that dot starts traveling up the line.. as in a stream, it will hold that form.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      yes.. im wanting some fucking crazy ish from avs.. but hell, it will look pimp as shit when im done, no? ;]~<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      but yeah stuff..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      its pretty much going to move around as well ;]~ i love random things.. they make me so happy ;]~ it means that i can stair at one visualization and not have to ever change the preset.. of course things like giess and gforce arent ever going to be recreated up here on avs.. unless lil ol me can figure out a way to have that sort of randomization for it.... ohh shit.... ;]~ *lightbulb* i gotta go now.. ill explain later</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>ok, back to the old one now as well...</strong><br />
      for the movement... i never really understood what ya meant by yvalue + ymoveamt ..... what does that mean.. i have no clue..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      ok<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      what i need now is this.. i want the middle of the circle to be travelling along a path from point a to point b.. in a straight line.. i got a set randomization using a custom bpm setting, but on its way to point b.. all of a sudden the beat will move point b to a diff point on the grid and wherever the circle is at becomes point a .. so the process of the circle moveing from point a to b will start over again.. only this time the two points are different.. ohh... yes.. if you can get it so that the circle will move back and forth along the line.. that would be cool ;]~<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      example if possible<br />
      <br />
      ==== is the old path..<br />
      ---- would be the current path..<br />
      0 another beat would hit here causing another change in direction<br />
      a new point a<br />
      b new point b<br />
      a. old point a<br />
      b. old point b<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      1st: a-----0 b<br />
      <br />
      2nd: a.=====a b.<br />
      |<br />
      |<br />
      |<br />
      0<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      b<br />
      <br />
      3rd. a.=====a. b.<br />
      ||<br />
      ||<br />
      ||<br />
      a-------0 b<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      b.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      its kinda hard to show on here... its a really easy equation im sure... at least im hoping... but yeah.. it would really help if you could give me the equation .. and if other vars can be made for it .. can you explain it.. and where it goes..</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you just want the dots to move up in a straight line, just use a movement and a fade. If you want them all to move around, use a DM or a dynamic shift and a fade.

      hehehehe... ok.. for the circle you posted.. the one that moves in a direction.. i want to keep it so it doesnt go out of a certain boundery.. such as i dont want it going to the edge.. like say 0,1 is the farthest to the right the center of the circle can go right? well, i dont want the far right side of the circle being cut off by the edge..<br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>ok... another riddle ive been toying with</strong><br />
      bleh bleh bleh :weird: ok, so i figured out that i can get the circle to have its radius grow and shrink using a specific equation in the per frame area<br />
      <br />
      it is:<br />
      <br />
      rad=sin(t)/5<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      basically, i want to keep it from going too small... i want it to grow to a certain amount then shrink but not smaller than a specified amount... so how would i get to do that?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Attached is the SSC you want - Radius change, 45° diagonal movement added, always in area.<br />
      The diagonal movement might seem not diagonal at times - This is because I couldn't get them to bounce off the edge, and the sine/cosine function is the only way I can do it...<br />
      <br />
      I'd prolly work on the bounce later on... But since I'm a very lazy person, you'd prolly need to clutter my PM box with a lot of PMs =)<br />
      But then, you'll also need reinforcements from a lot of other people to convince me =þ<br />
      <br />
      If you want the SSC to go to RANDOM direction (Not the 8 basic directions), tx and ty into :<br />
      <br />
      tx=tx+tx1;ty=ty+ty1<br />
      <br />
      Change tx1 and ty1 to :<br />
      <br />
      tx1=rand(101)/1000-rand(101)/1000;<br />
      ty1=rand(101)/1000-rand(101)/1000;<br />

      For the first SSC, delete the whole *if stuff on the perframe part. Both outcomes from the if command are *1, so they're useless.</p>

      ok, first, i would like to make shapes, like a triangle, or a parallelogram, or a square, or a rectangle, or maybe... well... a prism.. or a cone.. how would i make these shapes?<br />
      <br />
      second, how would i make them filled in?<br />
      <br />
      b., how would i, using the dynamic movement trans, make the trails comeing off of the shapes all move upwards?<br />
      <br />
      16., i would like some basic equations and an explanation of some kind for the dynamic distance modifier thingy mahbobber...<br />
      <br />
      2000000., can you do the same thing as in number 16 as well for the dynamic movement trans thingy???? plz ????<br />
      <br />
      green, what is possible with the superscope? like is anything pretty much possible? or is there limits of some sort?<br />
      <br />
      peaches, is there a way to make a shape that is all wierd looking such as the shape of a pear or that of a banana?<br />
      <br />
      fruitjuice, is it possible to answer all of meh questions????? plz???<br />
      <br />
      4, what exactly does if(????) do? and how does it work, and what is all of the exceptable values for it?<br />
      <br />
      orange, can someone explain plz, what all the diff var thingy's do for the superscope???? plz... like the movements each would produce.. or just a sample problem for each variable available and an explanation for it plz.. just something simple..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">First : Apply your math knowledge, use point-by-point assignment, or, for the prism and cone, use the 3D SSC code (You can acquire this from El-Vis's 6th pack).<br />
      <br />
      Second : For 2D shapes, use s=bnot(s) (Screw around with this to figure out how to do it), for 3d shapes, use separate SSCs that are filled in w/ 3d code. Might want to fade the color out depending on the distance.<br />
      <br />
      b : Check rectangular coordinates, and put in y=y+0.01 (Or was it y=y-0.01? I forgot...)<br />
      <br />
      16 : DDM? The same thing w/ DM, but only D is configured.<br />
      <br />
      2000000 : DM? Uh... I believe other people have asked this in other topics...<br />

      4. If? Use it for point-by-point assignment and many, MANY other things... Using Above, Below, and Equal is quite essential for the condition part...<br />
      Otherwise, dig up others' AVSs to see what you can do with it ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">The if statement works in english is like this.<br />
      <br />
      if(check1,value1,value2)<br />
      <br />
      if check1 is equal to zero, return value1, otherwise return value2<br />

      eg.<br />
      x=if(equal(x,1),0,x);<br />
      <br />
      if x equals 1, make x 0, otherwise, make x what it already is.</p>
