      Just something that has bothered me for a while:<br />
      <br />
      If you go to the featured components in the Components section, you'll see WdM 3D Space (a set of red-blue anaglyph presets) is featured. However, the image that is used for it, has nothing to do with WdM, in fact, it's a duo preset.<br />
      <br />
      I can't imagine how this could've happened though :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">(I'm talking about the featured image btw, not the image that was submitted with the component)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wouldn't know what address to send it to . I noticed they did the same with Whacko AVS V on the Winamp2 part of the site: the featured image was a blur of colours which I'm sure couldn't have been created by WA-V.<br />
      <br />
      I get the idea that any email @winamp.com or @nullsoft.com is sent to /dev/null :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wonder if they're even aware of those kinds of blatant errors...Sort of like AVS presets getting published in the general use plugins section :rolleyes:</p>
