<div class="posttext">Here are those packs: &quot;The History of the House&quot; r1,<br />
                  and &quot;Chromatic AVS&quot;.<br />
There are quite many new 2d and 3d developing methods used<br />
                  in the presets, 3d in HOT House,<br />
and both 2d and 3d in Chromatic AVS,<br />
so that they need your insight from here.<br />
                  Although, here is still the first release<br />
of them, but, probably, there will be SE for them all.<br />
                  May be, they will become better.<br />
Notes: 1. Additional plug-ins required:<br />
          Picture II, Conv. filter, and Global Variables.<br />
       2. My new address is equaker9@yahoo.com.<br />

<div class="posttext">The message shown over is a reply to the introducing question really published.<br />
According to the subject of this:<br />
I have designed the update for Chromatic AVS; it is an update to the whole pack; of course, some problems are fixed there, and it caused the framerate to increase in some presets to *1.2. It became a serious pack now: all slack presets are filtered; but not all problems are fixed.<br />
:( That is not well<br />
:cry: so i need help<br />
the next is very serious:<br />
Frame Work 1.2b: it has a half framerate!:cry: why it is possible? When it appeared, it had average framerate, but the view was rather shameful for the pack.<br />
Then, it was needed to improve. The logical timer was added, and it made SSCs to calculate in the background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">The Earthquaker</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2006, 08:41</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I had to (1) add timer control to SSC Effect Lists (there was one such list), this was made successfully, and (2) add screen update control (last List). It was still not very fast then, and for further improve this, I've doubled the engine, added the progress stripe, added text for the first black frame, simple effect for that; but the old-date timer (just gt=(t-floor(t))*6 for SSC, bt=(t-floor(t))*2 for screen updating) couldn't work with additions. The ver.1.11 worked a few better than all previous, but I've failed to build the correct dual timer. There is needed that the second counter to start as the first, but from half scr. update time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry Earthquaker, people are usually a bit more active than this (but not much)<br />
<br />
Tip for getting people to view your presets: Do not upload lots of different versions and updates. People cant be bothered to see marginally different versions of a preset, they just want one version, regardless of its state of polish.<br />
<br />
As for your presets, they are ok, it is good that you made an effort with coding but a lot of them are essentially the same preset with minor tweaks which is quite boring to watch. Pick one and stick to it. Some of the others were quite nooby, i would explore your coding a bit further.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree in general with Pak's comment. Packs consisting of small variations on a single preset are, well, boring. You obviously know how to code, and some of the presets are quite nice, but, as Pak said, some looked quite nooby (like the &quot;puzzle one&quot;, basically, that &quot;shaking&quot; DM is unnecessary). Also, you shouldn't put the pictures in a directory. They belong to the AVS root dir.</div></div><hr />

 Also, you shouldn't put the pictures in a directory. They belong to the AVS root dir. Yes I forgot to mention that, please do not put pictures in a seperate directory, it just means more time spent hunting them out and putting them into the root directory. Also if you must release lots of different versions have them all in a subdirectory of your name, for example &quot;Earthquaker/Pack 1&quot; and &quot;Earthquaker/Pack 2&quot;. Your AVS directory may be quite small with mostly your own stuff in it, but mine is not and I dont like having to hunt for packs!</div></div><hr />

I dont understand.<br />
<br />
Is it supposed to look like a point light, or something else. Cos if its supposed to be a point light, there is some mistake somewhere :P</div></div><hr />

This could be not similar to the illumination in real life, because &quot;position eval&quot; section had a strange evaluation method - its timer was other than in &quot;global timer&quot; component, that caused incomplete torus rendering, not point light. The best way of it was to make &quot;position eval&quot; to give position every screen update time, but that makes a small problem<br />
      Screen update timer works with a linear time input, and the only way to make a reaction of it is probably the common gt=(tr-floor(tr))*2 or anything of this kind and making output of pos needs above(gt,0.99)<br />
this is a crashing approximation. So how much better was to make a complete light torus (or a circle of point lights). So to this topic above:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you repeat that in English please?<br />
<br />
If you are going to talk tech make sure you use the correct terms and such... or it is incredibly confusing.<br />
<br />
I'll check out your attachment and see if i can make sense of it, but I can't dl at the moment :/<br />
<br />
EDIT: Looking at the attachment i still cant understand what you are trying. I will hazard a guess though: You want to make a volumetric light source shaped like a torus. If this is the case, then why is the highlight produced so strange (point like, yet distorted)?<br />
<br />
Also, the interactivity is terrible, its just far too slow.<br />
Another tip is to use the correct words. Instead of having help saying 'gamma' inverts the colors, call it 'invert' and the help becomes redundant. 'gamma' means something else, so its confusing.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: I don't mean to offend you for being foreign... its just genuinely hard to understand for me.</div></div><hr />
