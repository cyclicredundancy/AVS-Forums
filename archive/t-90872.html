      Just another experiment... creating a somewhat realistic swimming movement.</p>

      They look like a circuit! Awesome preset! I'd never thought of doing fish in AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>actually no</strong><br />
      I originally was going to say I couldn't see what was happening, but I kind of could if I turned off mosaic. Then it switched to a song with regualar beats, and it started doing cool stuff. I was going to suggest putting an eye on it so I can see which way it's pointing. I totally switched my message around even before the edit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well the mosaic was on purpose... I can make the fish clearer when needed. I just haven't found a better effect to apply to them. On their own, the fish are pretty boring :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a clean version... you can add lots and lots of fish because it's very fast :) Or run it at a high-res... the superscopes should adapt to width/height changes.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and the fish now move, even when there are no beats (though not as fast though, and not synchronized).<br />
      <br />
      Ps: What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nifty. And I still manage to average over 28 FPS with 35 fish. :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sick! Mine averaged 14 fps with 44 fish, with the render mode switch on. When off it jumped up to 20. I'd say you've got a winner here!<br />
      <br />
      Could I use this in a preset? Credit will be given of course. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ooh, cool!<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, is it possible to eliminate the "turn back" and make it so that when the fishies are outta the screen, they "teleport" to the other side of the screen?<br />
      <br />
      I'm not exactly sure whether or not this would make a nice effect, but hey, instead of seeing the fishies from outside the aquarium, viewing them from the inside would be nice =)<br />
      <br />
      Too bad putting them in an aquarium would be too much more work =(<br />
      <br />
      Hmm, is it just me, or UnConeD had moved from the 3D DM domain to the 3D/Nifty SSC domain?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks UC. :) I wasn't intending to release it anyway until I finish NDD2, which won't be for a while (seeing as I only have 5 presets ready). If push comes to shove, I could always hold it until the pack after that.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>LOL!!!</strong><br />
      I remember UnConeD saying he made the rollercoaster preset instead of studying for exams! You know that all these presets are just basically appetizers for the meal yet to come! This is just fluff; the best is yet to come. Now being smart enough to have great "fluff" and still have waaay better stuff coming means you've gotta be extremely smart :D<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>how do you speed up the presets?</strong><br />
      I've always wondered how you figure out what stuff is slowing it down to speed up your presets like you do. BTW: I got your joke about fish without eyes :D funny. Makes me think of Lord of the Rings and Gollum. To tell if he's really asleep, whisper "Fish" in his ear. If there's no reaction-he must be asleep! LOL.</p>
