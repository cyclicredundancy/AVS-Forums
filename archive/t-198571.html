      <p class="post-content">Wow, these are both really good. It's great to see you've already got the hang of 3d! Did you write it all yourself? Nice stylish presets, good colours, but "scope" sucks a lot of fps. Multi filters are the worst, instead use a colour map with black at both ends and white in the middle, and most of the time the same effect can be acheived with a convo filter, although they kill fps as well (try to keep them set on multiples of 2). Simple things like d=d*0.95 don't need to be in a dynamic movement, use a regular movement. Try not to have as many black backgrounds, put a unique tone on a dark colour and put invert and additive on. Or just a simple invert.<br />

      I fixed them up a little for you and kept the old ones so you can see how they differ.</p>
