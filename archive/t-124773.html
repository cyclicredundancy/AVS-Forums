<div class="posttext">How cool would it be if we all got together in groups of 2 and made AVS! If we made Presets in pairs and compiled them all into one large pack, Itd ROCK!<br />
If your interedsted apply below, This would be awesome, You should try it out~!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Too busy with school, my own pack, my own wa2 skin... sorry.<br />
Though it would be cool if everyone would participate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There has been posted threads like this couple before, but if I remember right they collapsed before even started. It's pretty hard to gather lots of people to one single AVS pack, if I'm right Deviant Blend 4 (unpublished) with 13 AVSsers involved keeps the record of this.. that would be a hell of a milestone. I would take a part of this, buuut I'm just too busy right now :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">This is a very different adn exciting concept though, AVS presets, 1 preset made in part by 2 people, Itd be cool as!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Most people here don't have the time to work on a preset with someone else.  Some of my presets have taken 3 weeks to make - for one preset.  I don't have the time right now to do this either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Pairing off would be difficult - I think it's a good idea to pair up with people who have opposite style of AVS as you do, but still is very good (Example : An aesthetic person pairing with some heavily technical person)... or a remixing chain (Remix and reremix and rereremix and rerereremix and... you get the idea).<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a good idea, but pairing off and creation of the presets would be a chaos.<br />
<br />
Anyways, should we call dibs on who can we partner up now? (Make sure both sides agree) :p :p :p<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I had this idea long time ago...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think we could draw the names from Random, me and Nic01 would be an interesting match up for sure, or me adn Atero, <br />
<br />
Or me and UnConeD or Jheriko ( The Ghods of AVS )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The only problem is to have the other side agree with you and make it so that it's a balance... It's pretty hard with not too many intermediate people around, somewhat nice amount of pros, and a handful of newbies in this forums. This *will* be an interesting event...<br />
<br />
I call Atero :)</div></div><hr />
