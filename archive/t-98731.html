      <p class="post-content">Hey, not too shabby. You're not afraid of coding a SSC, that's always a plus. I never really did like that combined movement and water effect you use in waterland. (quite the name by the way :) ) Some were pretty basic, but that's to be expected considering it's your first stab. I did quite like 'beware the xx' and 'crazyeye'. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dunno about experienced. :) I have one pack, and it got 3 stars. I assure you, the stuff I'm working on now is more impressive.<br />
      <br />
      Personal fave in the pack is the tripping mix of moving kalidescope.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>my favorites in your pack</strong><br />
      man; i _really_ like hall of mirrors mix for your kalidoscope<br />
      (and that "evil" one is pretty damned erie(is that how u spell it?)<br />
      i for one; would have given yours at _least_ a 4<br />
      i do like the 3d superscopes; but i think it is a little more "artsy" to not have to use them (or maybe that is just the lazy part of me speaking up :)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      oh yeah; i _can not_ find where to submit my pack; and i assume it is becuase the website is under construciton; kinda.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have a working 3D star, to be released, but it's floating around here somewhere.<br />
      <br />
      As for submitting an AVS pack, plugins are now called components. it's under the component menu.</p>
