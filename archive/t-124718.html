<div class="posttext">Okay guys, please forgive me in advance for asking what I'm sure has been asked and answered too many times:<br />
<br />
I just got Winamp 3 and a video cable to output the visualizations to my TV.  Only problem is that when I go fullscreen (TV on or just the computer's monitor), the patterns slow down to a crawl and don't keep any kind of sync with the music.<br />
<br />
I'm not very good with computers, so if someone has the time to help me understand how to speed up the full-screen patterns, I'd really appreciate it.  And please note, use small words :igor: .<br />
<br />
THANK YOUUUUUUU!!!!<br />

<div class="posttext">Set pixel doubling (it will make avs uglier but faster) then buy 2400000000 GHz processor and then U can run AVS smoothly everywhere...<br />
...and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.<br />
I allready like U...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Search the Forums.  This has been answered before(several times).  You will find all possibilities for speeding up AVS, but the only one which will make a notable difference is to buy a computer with a better processor(i.e. PentiumIV 3.06GHz).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd say he's most likely a) not using overlay mode b) using a much higher fullscreen res.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd say B. A doesn't make nearly as much of a difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">to butt in, you could also buy an athlon XP2600 - faster and cheaper than 3.06 HT! :D *multiple grins* :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Update: An Athlon XP 3000+ if at all! :D<br />
But i wonder how much boost an Athlon 64 will give to AVS!<br />
(maybe  Nullsoft can't publish AVS 2.6 cause they're busy recoding it in 64 Bit :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th February 2003, 21:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">1) AVS will never see 64-bit EVER.<br />
2) HT is not to be underestimated.<br />
3) With AMD you get what you pay for, hope you have your fan and warranty ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Besides the fact that Pentium is slower in general, I've been told AMD is a lot better for AVS.<br />
That and - hey! - ever heard of a cooling system?  Fuck overclocking, just freeze yer damn comp.  I heard somebody stuck his 586 in a freezer full of alcohol and played Quake fullscreen at full speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th February 2003, 11:44</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or you can spend 200 $ for a hydrogen and water cooling system that keeps your amd2400+ at 20 degrees celsius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th February 2003, 12:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or even better, a fluid Nitrogen Cooling System - It'll freeze your AMD's Ass off! But you can't pay that kind of stuff - unfortunately :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th February 2003, 15:05</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Or you can buy a damn fast CPU to run AVS at 30+ fps and a medium size cooler to keep it at 50-55...Also keep the case open :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Dude...this is all it is: a freezer, and about five cases of high-proof (I believe that's the term used for %age of alcohol) vodka.  Find some way to purify the vodka if you really want to.  Now run some cables through your freezer door - insulate them properly! - and stick your comupter in there, with the bottles of alcohol sitting all around it.  If you've got one of those big-ass freezers it's even better because you're probably not using all of it :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, that'll take your computer down so damn low, if you had a decent proccessor you could run Water Cube at 640x480 with a 320x240 DM at full speed :p *drool*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">How about doing this with on a computer with dual Intel Xeon 2.8Ghz processors.<br />
<br />
*me drools at thought of any of UnConeD's presets on 800x600 with this*</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Won't happen on the Xeon processors. They aren't backwards compatible. Now the Optetron... (sp?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't be possible because *puts on teacher suit* electrons move at light speed if you shrink the length of a cycle so damn low, the electrons wont be able to pass through the CPU within one cycle.<br />
<br />
See, we're physically limited. :cry:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Smaller CPU's then.  What is the maximum frequency we can use then?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ummm... lets see:<br />
At 5 Ghz Light moves 5,994 cm far per cycle.<br />
At 1 Thz it would be only 0,2997 millimeters.<br />
<br />
But its not really exact as the speed of electricity is a bit below lightspeed, depending on the matereal it has to go though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bad pun time!<br />
<br />
If you use the IUPAC naming system for elements, &quot;pentium&quot; would be the fifth element - boron.  I don't think I need to say more about that one.<br />
Now the new &quot;Xeon&quot; processors are quite close to &quot;xenon&quot; - a noble gas (that won't combine with anything).  Hey kids!  Can you say &quot;software conflict&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, i can!!! :up:</div></div><hr />
