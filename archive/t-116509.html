      <p class="post-content"><strong>Various aspects tuning</strong><br />
      Wanted ability to tune various aspects of AVS from preset code - window size, pixel doubling and even overlay mode. Of course, beat detection and else. Probably some people dont' want allow presets change these parameters. Therefore it must be flag disabling internal tuning. Of course this flag must not be accessible from preset code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What good is it if you can turn it off? It won't be 100% sure that the preset is viewed as it should if the feature can be turned off :igor:<br />

      Besides it would totally piss of n00bs and then they would come to this forum and yell: "<b>AN AVS PRESET CHANGED MY SETTINGS!!!%&#194;&#164;#! HOW DO I PREVENT THIS!!!"!&#194;&#164;#"!%&#194;&#164;"# PLEAAAAZZZZ HELP!!!! IM DESPERATE!!</b>"<br />
      <br />
      I can't deny though that it is a nice idea, the window size setting would allow to create really different presets, but i don't think that's absolutly necessary since you can code scopes and dm's to work in all different kind of resolutions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Guys read again - I told there must be flag disabling internal settings change. That means in Settings\Display must appear setting with 2 values:<br />
      <br />
      On - Enable preset change internal settings of AVS<br />
      Off - Disable preset change internal settings of AVS.<br />
      <br />
      If user is smart enough it can turn this on. For others it is off. And preset itself cannot ever change this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't see the point in controlling overlay mode from code... how do you think people would react when they're browsing presets and suddenly their desktop background changes?<br />
      <br />
      Similarly, why control beat-detection? Write your own beat detection then...<br />
      <br />
      The only option I do want is the ability for effect-lists with a different internal resolution.<br />
      <br />
      For example, a half-size (or percentage size) effect list that is rescaled to normal size when blended with the rest. Similar, a fixed-resolution effect list. If they add the option for bilinear-filtering or not, this would be a better replacement than messing with the user's pixel doubling setting.<br />
      <br />
      Besides, if a preset were to include code to change an option, where would it be turned back? We'd have to add an 'on unload' piece of code to every component just for this purpose. Seems wasteful to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok there are points to talk about...<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        I don't see the point in controlling overlay mode from code... how do you think people would react when they're browsing presets and suddenly their desktop background changes?
      </blockquote>Overlay mode assumes that some overlayed color must be set on desktop. It is controlled by user. Of course, WinAmp could automatically change this color and run in overlay mode. For example set desktop to 0x000001 and overlay this. But it MUST warn user about it and do nothing if user declines. I do not insist on auto-overlay feature. But some presets have good look on desktop. And I'm sure many users even dont' know about desktop overlay ability. We can show it.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        Similarly, why control beat-detection? Write your own beat detection then...
      </blockquote>Hm. Why should I write my own if I could just change settings of AVS? It already has two modes - they are completely enough. I noticed my presets better look with "standard" detection. But some others with "advanced". I want set option as I see.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        Besides, if a preset were to include code to change an option, where would it be turned back? We'd have to add an 'on unload' piece of code to every component just for this purpose. Seems wasteful to me.
      </blockquote>I had an answer for this question before. But right now I just got better idea. All this can be implemented as APE. Name it - "Override settings". You can get idea from it's name. If such APE appeares in tree - AVS ignores it's default settings and uses provided by preset. And in this APE it MUST be ability set window size and position. Just imagine - window can change it's position and size while working. If expressions and variables will be available in this APE - window can even dance on screen... Jump on beat... Wow... I want this.<br />
      <br />
      Of course if there is no such APE - AVS goes as now. Of course it must apply default settings each time when preset starts. Then if user selects even old preset - AVS will appear as usual.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>No offense but this sounds like a HORRIBLE idea. Why the hell would I want the window to dance on screen? And besides, how much 'dancing' can a rectangle do? It would only make it harder to view the preset, IMO. Just think about it practically. A rectangle that is bouncing around on the screen. How would you change the preset if it keeps moving around? How would you close it?<br />
      This sounds like one of those things that might be cool in your head, but suck practically.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>This depends hugely on the music playing as well. There is no reason to say something will work better with one beat detection than with another.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Don't get me wrong, I'm all for progress, but you're thinking from a preset author's point and not a user. Any feature that is added should be made to allow the user to see prettier presets, nothing else.<br />
      <br />
      Users *hate* anything that changes without their knowledge. I would hate it if a preset changed my overlay color or turned overlay on/off.<br />
      <br />
      If only one feature could be added to AVS, I would certainly not want this, because I would turn it off the first moment it annoyed me, and never look back again.

      <p class="post-content">Dude, think for two seconds. If the AVS window suddenly started moving around on the screen without you telling it to, what would YOU do? If you simply accept what's happening I suggest you run Norton a few times and see how many virii you've let sit around your system for years on end.<br />
      <br />
      Nobody but NOBODY wants to have messages popping up for 'Can AVS switch to overlay mode?' and 'Can AVS change your window size?' and 'Can AVS change your color settings?' whenever they open presets. Like I said before, if some n00b all of a sudden sees AVS switching corners of the screen every few seconds he'll wonder what the fuck is happening to his computer, NOT what's happening to his AVS window. Thus anyone who actually uses 'aspect tuning' is never going to be very highly regarded in the AVS community. You want your presets to get deleted a minute after they're installed? Fine by me - just do it somewhere else.</p>

      <p class="post-content">First of all I wanna set window size and change "pixel doubling" from preset. About dancing window - I would like see it on my screen. It can not only jump but float or change it's sizes. On your 3D preset camera can be synchronized with this window (if only global variables appear...). It will look as you see at large 3D world throgh floating window. About how to close it - it must stop changes if music mutes. But again - this is just an idea which I like see. As user.<br />
      <br />
      And here is another problem with AVS - how to tell user what he will have while preset runs. What he must do to get preset properly looking - as author recommends. Of course there is Misc\Comment window - but to access it user has dive to preset code. O course README.TXT can be compiled and shown while installation. But it lays deeply in directories structure - not useful for further views. Special intro preset can be created and placed first in stack. But how much text can you place there? This all is not so useful to use and to create. I did not see detailed introductions. I'd prefer ability place some readme.html file to collection directory. And this file must appear on top of collection. When clicked - this file openes in internal WA browser. This allows do many things. So many.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're not listening, gourmet. NOBODY WANTS AVS TO DO THINGS THEY'RE NOT TELLING IT TO DO. If I'm just randomly switching presets, I do NOT want a pop-up asking me if I want my settings changed. No one else does either. If I'm not in control of my computer, it's virtually useless to me - my computer is here to do what I tell it to; it always has been and it always SHOULD be.<br />
      And I will say once again: If you're new to the world of AVS - not just writing, but watching - and all of a sudden you get a popup saying "The screen's going to start moving now" and every time you try to stop it you can't get a hold of it, you're not going to like AVS very much. Think about what you're asking for...just because YOU want to see that doesn't mean everyone else will.</p>

If this name selected then just DDE it to WinAmp mini-browser. Period. All other non-avs files will be ignored. When doing auto switching presets AVS will ignore all non-avs files. As it does it now.<br />
      <br />
      Why use other viewers if you already have mini-browser near and skinned?

      <br />
      Examples would be:<br />
      <br />
      1) The Winamp Minibrowser<br />
      2) Netscape Navigator<br />
      3) Internet Explorer<br />
      4) Opera<br />
      5) Mozilla<br />
      <br />
      I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Also, some people don't always use the Winamp Minibrowser, so, if the Minibrowser isn't enabled, they can choose to either:<br />
      <br />
      1) Activate the Minibrowser to read the HTML/TXT readme<br />
      2) Use the default Web broswer on their system (usually Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to view the HTML readme<br />
      <br />
      or<br />
      <br />
      3) open Notepad/WordPad/other word processing software to read a TXT readme.

And this is more universal and easer to implement - no code needed to tune to operating system. Just "open default Web-browser" even for .txt file. Simple.

      <p class="post-content">I agree with Atero... if you're so bent on it, write it yourself as a 'misc / comment HTML' ape or something, it's not that hard. But aside from Clashman no-one seems to want it. I think it's a horrible feature, and I'd refuse to download any pack that popped up annoying HTML when I'm viewing it.<br />
      <br />
      (Idem for installers that close down your Winamp, change your preset-switching options, change the resolution, etc.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just 'cause you two think Gourmet's idea sucks doesn't mean EVERYONE does (case in point: ME).<br />
      <br />
      Also, who ever said that the readme had to pop up every time a preset from the pack was loaded? It could easily pop only the first time a preset was loaded.<br />
      <br />
      Example script for such a thing (in the completely fictitious but easy to understand ClashScript language):<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />if TimesLoaded&gt;0 and Preset LoadedFromDirectory=yes then noexecute #onload </code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This checks the PresetLoadedFromDirectory flag, which answers the query "Was a preset loaded from directory c:\Program Files\Winamp\wacs\avs\{directory}?" and the Times variable, which answers the question "How many times was a preset loaded from this directory?". If both answers are negative, then the #onload string executes.<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />#onload(c:\Program Files\Winamp\wacs\avs\{directory}\*.avs) set PresetLoadedFromDirectory=yes,TimesLoaded=1,loadfile(c:\Program Files\Winamp\wacs\avs\{directory}\readme.txt)<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      This sets the Preset Loaded From Directory flag in the script to "yes" and the variable Times to "1" - these are the key flags for the previous ClashScript line.

      <p class="post-content">Looks like you didn't get idea... Preset or else will not pop-up anything if you dont' want.

      <br />
      About write APE - I'll think. If only it is possible create an APE which can access and change presets list collected by AVS. Right now I have no C++ compiler installed on home computer. At work I do rather different things.</p>

Even if you DID get half the community, that's still half that are opposed, and that's half the people's AVS that you're going to be virtually smashing to pieces since half the people that see yours are going to say 'screw AVS, it's a piece of shit.'<br />

      <br />
      Yes, but no...<br />
      <br />
      Switching windowsize is all I want - It will help other people to get the most out of a preset, but...<br />
      <br />
      1) Newbies will make this a source of problems. Defaulting it to off will only delay their pleads for help, not prevent it.<br />
      2) Newbies with fast comps might set it to a high resolution, which will annoy people with slower computer.<br />
      3) Newbies will have bad reactions to presets that change AVS around (Example : AVSociety packs...)<br />
      4) It's likely that only experienced people will use it properly - Newbies will do odd things with this, trust me.<br />
      5) Default resolution for non-windowsize changing preset.<br />
      <br />
      So, my final decision? No. I like the idea and it might come in handy, but only experienced artists will use it properly, and with the sheer amount of newbies...</p>

Author of AVS <i>(with it's limited scripting language)</i>? I'd better follow UnConed recomendations but not your's. Cause you have no recomendations. I tried find any component submited by you. No one. Since Jun 2001 - date of your registration - you didn't submit anything. You are just a "poster". Poster posting postings. They are not significant at all. You dont' give any positive idea cause you have no them. You are just characters on my screen wasting bits in RAM of my computer. Then shut up and go read manuals in the corner. Probably you will get smarter than lame moron. Someday.<br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>When I'll have time - maybe I'll make it. Now I'm a businessman and have few of time to create anything more complex than presets. And I have another more complex idea about 3DVS - same as AVS but with OpenGL built-in. I'm going download and read NullSoft programming docs after NewYear. Until this I'll have no much time. And I have a point - readme feature must be supported by AVS intebally. To simplify create readme - just drop a text to folder and viola.<br />
      <br />
      Can anyone tell me - does AVS allow for APE change collection submenu content?

      <p class="post-content">I've submitted 4 packs - the nullsoft search engine just sucks, that's all. The first 3 were getting used to AVS, the other one was The Forward Flow 1.0 and it's on the presets forum somewhere, and on deviantART; I haven't gotten it submitted because some WA.com glitch won't let me. TFF2.0 is done, the installer needs work before I'm submitting it. TFF3.0 is started with 4 presets so far.<br />
      <br />
      You, as far as I know, have submitted 1 pack of VU-meters, the easiest effects on earth.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now, I've told you several reasons why this idea won't work; UnConeD and Nic01 have just repeated them. Newbies will not like this because they won't be able to figure it out - you were a newbie once (and as far as I can tell, you still are), think about it: You, at one time, fiddled with the undocumented settings of AVS to figure out what they did. Chances are nine out of ten people new to AVS are going to do the exact same thing and freak out when they see the window changing or jumping around on the screen when they don't know why, even if you provide a readme - who reads readme's anyway?<br />
      <br />
      The only part of this that could possibly be useful would be radio buttons for "Snap window size to..." for 4x3, square etc. Otherwise we get complaints like "AVS is freaking out!!! PLZ HLP!!!!!1" As Nic01 said, with the sheer amount of n00bs that play with AVS we're gonna get swamped with shit like that.<br />

      2nd - may be they are simple (for me) but no one created same before.<br />
      3d - You cannot calculate. There were 2 packs of VU-meters. Even you tried tell something stupid in comments for second pack. And there is already another one pack of presets submitted by me. All 3 packs appeared in 2 mounths. And latest packs already had several updates.<br />
      4th - "The easest" 1st pack earned more than 50 000 downloads in 2 mounths... If you would more clever - you'd probably understand - not <b>complexity</b> is important. "All genious is simple" - that is ancient truth.<br />

      <p class="post-content">A bit full of ourselves, aren't we...?<br />
      <br />
      First of all I meant AVS newbie, which you have to have been because you can't be experienced at AVS the first time you use it - it's not documented at all. Even my AVS Primer (which I forgot to mention) isn't enough to go off of when you first are introduced to AVS.<br />
      I don't give a shit how many downloads you've gotten, you're still not good enough of an AVS-er that you can brag about them. Complexity doesn't actually matter in your actual presets; it's how complex you can make them that shows your experience.<br />
      <br />
      I don't remember your second pack - frankly I didn't pay much attention to them. Also, just because you were first doesn't mean it's good. The reason nobody (else)'s done VU meters is because nobody has bothered with them.<br />
      <br />
      And honestly, I wouldn't go to that much trouble just to get my packs submitted at WA. The Winamp AVS reviewers (staff and users alike) are assholes - you saw what happened to Whacko VI...The only reason I submit to deviantART is because it's quick and easy - I'm not "big enough" in the AVS community yet that they'd actually get very much attention. I'd MUCH rather post them here, to the people I know and who aren't just going to shoot it down at first sight.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Whether the AVS window is jumping around on the screen or popping up some annoying HTML document every time you load, it's still fucking annoying and nobody's going to look at any presets they saw that used this. Newbies would either abuse it and/or get fed up with AVS because of it. Once again - if you're so bent on getting this into AVS, WRITE YOUR OWN FUCKING APE.</p>

      <br />
      Gourmet: if you want this feature, code it yourself or find a coder who'll do that for you. An APE cannot modify the menu's itself, but I layed out an easy way to get around this earlier, without having to recode AVS at all: i.e. everyone's happy.<br />
