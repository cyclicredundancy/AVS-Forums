      <p class="post-content"><strong>Full screen AVS on secondary monitor on Dual Monitor System</strong><br />
      Hi all,<br />
      <br />
      Is it possible to get the AVS or other fullscreen effects on a specific monitor?<br />
      <br />
      I want to have a normal windows desktop on monitor 1 and on<br />
      monitor 2 I have connected a beamer to beam it on a wall.<br />
      <br />
      If I do this nou the second monito goes black or is showing only<br />
      the taskbar but you can do nothing... :(<br />
      <br />

      No-one can help me, but I can help you.<br />
      <br />

      The way I do what you are trying is to set the tv/projector desktop as Primary. I then run winamp on the monitor (secondary desktop now) and bring the taskbar there. If you are using a nvidia card, you should be able to select where dialog boxes pop up with the desktop manager which you can use to get boxes to pop up on your screen instead of the display monitor.,.<br />
      <br />
      You run avs in a window on your monitor, and use the overlay function to get it "full screen" on your tv/projector. This way, you can pick the best resolution for the windowed avs to give you the speed/definition you want on the "beamer".<br />
      <br />
      I actually have three desktops, and have run into some issues, but with only two, I found that it's quite easy/practical.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck. If you need any other help, don't hesitate to ask me, either e-mail or private message. I've been playing with avs on dual-displays for some time now and have gotten quite good at troubleshooting it.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you use a matrox g400/450/550 connect the beamer to the secound display(as TV), run winamp, and activate overlay mode(the backgroundcoulour doesen't affect the tv out put).<br />
      I used a g400 dualhead max and the settings above on many parties in the last months.</p>
