      <p class="post-content">Well i couldn't download them from your site...<br />
      <br />
      And usually we submit the presets here right in the forums (except if it goes over the forum size limit which is 100kb) So please submit your presets here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok these are some really simple presets, most of them just seem random stuff thrown together for an effect. For help in AVS check out the AVS FAQ right here in the AVS forums.</p>

      These are very very noob presets, the kind everyone makes at first. They aren't necessarily bad presets but everyone has seen the same things done over and over again and are sick of seeing them. Don't worry though, we've all made them like that, it's just a case of improving now and you've come to the right place. I'll point you in a few good directions :)<br />
      <br />
      The tips and tricks thread<br />
      The tips and tricks for beginners thread<br />
      The FAQ<br />
      Ateros primer<br />
      The search feature for the forums. There are countless threads full of valuable information for you to use and learn.<br />
      <br />
      Try and use things like the dynamic movement and superscope. Don't start by looking at hugeass pieces of code, start with simple things like a static circle, try and learn what simple code functions in avs do.<br />
      <br />
      Welcome to the forums and good luck on your avs journey :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh i agree, simple isn't bad. I love simple presets. But as for these presets... well i have seen same kind of presets too many times that i could enjoy them or scream "whoopy-doopy-doo" when i see such presets...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, pretty nooby. We've all been there. Don't sweat it. This is about having fun. Nobody's gonna smack you if you do something wrong. :)<br />
      <br />
      If you do use people's code though, you should include a commnt saying so in the preset. Credit where credit is due and all that.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, there is an edit button at the bottom of each post. Use it instead of posting 3 times in under 10 minutes.</p>
