The problem was that Raz and Qforce wanted to join even after that the originals had been spread for remixing, so they were not able to participate anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd really have loved to include Raz and Qforce back then.<br />
Raz spoke of 'red tape' but that's not the case really..<br />
<br />
The originals had been spread in a balanced way already. No presets were left to be remixed, and no other artists left for the remixing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Most people are really busy in late-december so I suppose we have to set the final deadline just before that. <br />
If we take a month for the remixing, then I suggest that we take November 19th 23:59 GMT for the first and December 17th 23:59 GMT for the final deadline.<br />

Is it okay with you guys if Yath and I manage this round?<br />

Posted by Warrior Of The Light<br />
The only thing I could say is that Nuclear Core is basically a remix.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a fresh preset. I made the oscilloscope orb, and decided to make a core to go along. I made a background that was origionaly a plain, but then I decided that If the orb were rushing through a tunnel, It would look 20x better. I just didn't know how to raytrace a tunnel so I looked at a tunnel by UnconeD, simplified it and put it in my preset with my  own texture and everything else. It was never a remix.<br />
<br />
What makes you think it was a remix? Is it simular to something youve seen before?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In this case, with remix I meant 'not a pure original' - From the comment(s), I thought you just used his DM without altering it.<br />

Also, can we have a fairly short remixing deadline, I think that historically most people are done with their remixes pretty quickly (remixing is easier than original work I think most people would agree).

if you can't send in originals, then there's nothing to remix because it wouldn't be fair towards the others.<br />

<div class="posttext">why again did i get 3 presets to remix?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You could've gotten 4 presets - two from two artists, in case some originals are 'not remixable' - but not everybody sent in two presets so you only got 3.<br />
<br />
I'll repeat for everyone that you don't need to remix them all, aim for about two remixes. Please don't do more than two unless they're really good because there are 18 originals in total and 11 artists. Do the math yourself.<br />
<br />
Raz: I don't know why the deadline would be anything else than December 17th?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Very good pack. The quality was much better this time around I think. No noob presets whatsoever.<br />
<br />
But .exe in a .zip? What were we thinking here people? Getting around setups that don't let you download .exe? Pointless and mildy annoying.<br />
<br />
So.... WFC6 anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th December 2006, 12:14</div></div>

<div class="posttext">thats alright wotl.. just making sure though lol.<br />
and i think we should take a little break before wfc6 J</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Damn, i totally missed a cool idea. Start the intro off looking into the inner cube thing and bringing the wfc V out, then when the V extends zoom out to reveal the whole winamp, curses.<br />

edit:<br />
oh yeah, great fucking job all.</div></div><hr />

You could also have 'traced out' the grid in the cube at the beginning for some extra niceness :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Great pack, guys. I'd normally comment at deviantart but I can't log in for some reason. At any rate, this is very impressive. I don't have much else to say but there is one special mention: Grandchild. My jaw fucking hit the floor when I saw your Class-Sick remix. Truly amazing, very nice job. :up:</div></div><hr />
