			<strong>Effects disappear - strange problem</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi. I have a really weird problem with the AVS:<br />
<br />
When i'm starting AVS everything seems to work fine (usually) but after a few changes of the presets it looks like most of the visual effects have disappeared. The screen is either completely black, white, keeps flashing in different colors or some (only 1 or 2) effects are still there and moving to the beats as they should or they're just still. The presets keep changing and it happens to all presets even those which were running correctly before. The only thing i can do is restarting Winamp but sometimes even this doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I'm running Winamp 2.91 with AVS 2.60 (Winamp 3.0 crashes :() on a 1.6ghz Athlon/768MB RAM and Win XP. Yep and i have re-installed Winamp ;)

		This MIGHT be a driver problem.  Reinstall your video drivers.  Also, try using 2.5(.1)

		I have the latest detonator driver installed (Had different versions but it didn't fix the problem) and all other graphic applications (Games etc...) are running fine.<br />
<br />
Do you have a quick link for the avs 2.51? Otherwise i'm gonna try to find it myself...<br />
<br />
thx for the tip :)

		My guess is that it's another AVS is changing question cleverly disguised as something hardly recognisable because this person doesn't regularly distinguish between presets.<br />
<br />
Just a guess. :p

		Thank you guys! I simply replaced the vis_avs.dll from my avs 2.6 with the .dll from avs 2.5!!! and now everything works fine! :)<br />
<br />
The 2.51 seems to have the &quot;bug&quot; too. I guess it could have something to do with process priorities cause with the dll version 2.5 it runs a bit slower and uses more processor power...although it runs fine :up:
