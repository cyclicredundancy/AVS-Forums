<div class="posttext">I want to know why undefined has falling in his works?<br />
<br />
I saw better packs from undefined with 4 or 4.5 stars, But, today I see his works with max 3 stars.<br />
<br />
If anybody knows or undefined is online please answer my question.<br />
<br />
I like his AVS packs &amp; I am adherent of his works.<br />
Thanks.:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the admiration! :D<br />
<br />
As for the lower rating of my packs recently (I assume you're talking about the MiniPak series), some of the themes I tackled weren't really brutal tests of my abilities, and the packs themselves are kinda small too. I don't know how the reviewers' minds work, but I'll bet these reasons play some sort of part.<br />
<br />
However, I aim to change all this with my next major pack. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can speeak for the b$w pack - it was alright, but there have been much better in that theme.  I really liked one of the presets(can't remember which one off the top of my head), but it was an average pack - hence the average points.  definitely not n00bish(which I give 1-2stars normally), but not UCD quality either - :p .</div></div><hr />
