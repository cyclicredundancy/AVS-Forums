      I just created this cool shiny starfeild thing, it's not much, but I think it could be a good addition to presets using starfields.<br />
      <br />
      It might get a little bright sometimes (becuase of the bump) but it's not too bad.<br />
      <br />
      (This isn't a preset, just an effect)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i don't really like this, even as an effect. It looks too distracting to be inserted into a preset. also, there are a few mistakes in the preset:<br />
      the second effect list does nothing<br />
      in the bump, you have<br />
      x=0.5+cos(t)*1;<br />
      the *1 does nothing except slow the preset<br />
      then you have y=0.5+sin(0)*.5;<br />
      sin(0) is the same as 0 (i think), so it is two unecessary operations<br />
      <br />
      plus, the movement is jerky and not very smooth.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Used something like this once.<br />
      <br />
      Slow the starfields down and toss on a decent DM and you might get a decent preset out of this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Uhm.. i don't think many will be "inserting" this into anything... add-on presets? Won't fly... Part of the fun does come for most of us that we do it from scratch. Besides do you really think anyone will credit you if they use same kind of effect? Simple things like this don't "belong" to anyone. If i would be to use a same kind of effect i wouldn't credit you for it just because you did it first :rolleyes:</p>
