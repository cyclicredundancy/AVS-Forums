      <p class="post-content">Well, I didn't care much for Fun. It didn't click with me at all. In Hypno v2 I didn't see a huge chage from v1. It looked like the same preset only using a simple osciliscope with one more movement thrown ontop. Trip v2 was pretty cool, except that the reticle didn't seem to follow the blob at all. It looks like it should.<br />

      I still think these need a bit of mork my man.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hypno was awful in my opinion. Noobish and it did that effect you get when mixing a water with a roto blitter. Eugh.<br />
      <br />
      Fun was better, nothing too great but better, and i think you should take off that godawful grain :p<br />
      <br />
      Now trip, that was much much better, but why must you people who are new to 3d DM's Stick a god forsaken interleave on all your movements :p come on man you can do better than that. Take a flow preset and stick a mirror on it and theres a much better one. Come on,you can be more creative than that. Good work mind but i really hate those interleaves ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is what I think of these presets:<br />
      <br />
      Fun - Decent but it would look better if the colors changed.<br />
      <br />
      Hypno - Everything in this preset (except the DM's) is n00bish. The colours should change.<br />
      <br />
      Trip - Fairly nice but the colours need to change.</p>
