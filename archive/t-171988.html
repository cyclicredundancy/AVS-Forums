<div class="posttext">Alright im Very new to this and i was wondering if i could get a little help... <br />
<br />
~My Puropse<br />
<br />
i take pics for night clubs here in New Orleans and i have a lot od DJ friends. They know me to have cool things that end up bein a hit with the clubs... <br />
<br />
~My Asking<br />
<br />
I have been kinda messing sround with the something very simple. they came to me and asked if i could make a visual to put on the projection screen at the club. we use winamps visuals and plugins all the time. <br />
<br />
what they asked me to do is make something cool to introduce them as the dj playing. i came up wit something like this as an example... <br />
if you could try one of the avs that i have here. (http://soccrfool7.intrac.net/SHIZZ/) <br />
(feel free to look at the pics too!!)<br />
<br />
now i am stuck... i wanted something a little better than that. i dont know the code and the math yet. <br />
<br />
is there someoe that can help me out with this or if you have a lil free time make something similar. <br />
<br />
do something that makes the text readable but move... change colors... explode... what ever? <br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
Brent</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Using render/text doesn't allow you a whole lot of freedom. You can make letters with superscopes  and that would give you pretty much complete control.<br />
<br />
Letters are not that hard to set up. Just a whole whack of if statements.<br />
Then you make them do some funky stuff. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll take up my little project to make the alphabet again. I got about half way through last time. :)<br />
<br />
I made the attached preset for my GFs b-day. Feel free to mess with it if you want.</div></div><hr />
