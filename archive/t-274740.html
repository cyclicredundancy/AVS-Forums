      I'm not sure how much time I'll have for remixing but I'll do my best. I'm on my honeymoon in the last two weeks of september, and the two weeks before our wedding will be pretty busy I think but I guess I can find some time</p>

      But, if we'd go for a 5 week / 3 week schedule as yath suggested, which is a really good idea by itself IMO, I fear that I can't join.. there's no way I can create 2 quality remixes in just the one week that I'd have.</p>

      </blockquote>I thought about that too from WFC1 on, but I couldn't think of how to accomplish that: Most likely their originals are going to be remixed by others - and a remix can't be included without the original, or can it?<br />
      <br />
      can it?<br />
      <br />
      -<br />
      <br />
      This community is not that large and everybody knows everybody (apart from perhaps some newbs).<br />
      I was hoping we could at least trust each other to keep our word. Sadly experience tells otherwise.<br />

      If you don't want to participate in both parts, then don't join.

      <p class="post-content">i highly encourage you to make two originals and remixes, there is plenty of time. as for wotl, if enough originals have been submitted before the first deadline, you will get the presets to remix earlier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">question: the presets have to be new or released before. because my last pack was full or remixes.<br />
      and remixes of the other people's presets submited here, or remixes of any preset we like?<br />
      and just to be sure. how many presets do we have to submit? 2 originals and one remix?<br />

      What you asked is very good. i do not know the answer but to me your no noob if you can ask a simple question instead of going nuts with random topics you need to know.<br />
      <br />
      I myself was wondering the same thing about the WFC system and how it is really done.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">The way it works is everyone sends their two presets to an e-mail address, then two random presets are sent back for remixing once they've all been collected. The only presets you will see prior to the release are the two you can remix. That way nobody but the organiser knows what kind of pack it's going to be, makes it more interesting.<br />
      <br />
      I like the mystery system, but I still suggest a more lax approach to what people 'have to' submit. It's supposed to be creative and fun, not a day in court, remember.</p>

      but then again the choice to choose who you remix would be nice.

      <p class="post-content">about remixes again.. i think it would be better if people receive extra presets to remix. if they can't do anything good to one, they'd still have another to try on. maybe this will produce motivation for the artists to remix. to keep the balance, there's still a limit of 2 remixes you can submit.</p>

      Is it possible to resend a newer version of a preset?<br />
      There is a very big convo-filter that costs some fps that could be done faster.<br />
      <br />
      I'd like to send a newer version of this preset.<br />
      I will send the newer preset when you give your OK.<br />
