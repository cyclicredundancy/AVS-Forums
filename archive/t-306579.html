      I'm not all that smart when it comes to programming or debugging, so I'm not sure if it's my preset that is wrong, or if it's a bug in AVS. before the latest version (5.5.5.2460) it was working fine, even on 5.5.5.2353 it was working. what the preset is supposed to do is take the getspec data and make sort of like VU meters. now it doesn't do that, and I don't know what is wrong. I'm posting it here because perhaps someone can help me figure out what's wrong. I have several presets based on this concept and they all are suffering from this problem.</p>

      <p class="post-content">it's gotta be something(s) in .2460 since that is what changed. I can't understand why an older version of AVS would work properly with a broken version of Winamp, although I can imagine it happening.</p>

      <p class="post-content">aww, poor DrO. it's ok, we still love you. to be honest, I get a little confused with all the bug reporting locations, I'm not sure where to post and I don't want to crosspost, so I choose one location and pray for the best</p>
