		Hey MaTTFURY.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest.  :) <br />
<br />
It was on purpose that I did't make more choice's to vote on. This is my first AVS! So either people like it or not! :D <br />
I did start from scratch and suddently 8 hours was gone! At this point I don't really understand the code for the diffrent effects, but any way I did change some of the values in the dynamic distant modifier and move around with the effect-list's. <br />
In the end I'll did't want too much to go around because I think it will get meassy, on the other hand I'll did't want too little, because then the AVS is getting boring! (My point of view). <br />
So is it an act of balance. :igor:<br />
At some time i'm getting it, if i'm fooling around enough ;)<br />
And maybe i'll be better to write in english!<br />
