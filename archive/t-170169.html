<div class="posttext">Not sure if this ever occurred to you, but we do indeed have a subforum called Presets for the specific purpose of posting presets...   See how that works?<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoa... you posted that a few seconds before I did...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;Say it once, say it twice. Say it three times&quot;<br />
<br />
Next time post your presets to the AVS Presets subforum, posting your presets in the main forum doesn't exactly strike confidencuality into our minds and might prevent us from checking out your work. That's why all this negative input on your post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm really sorry about it. If i took a wrong place here then could you move my post in right forum please. Sorry again. But still there is a question - do you like it? (or dislike)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The first one is alright, kind of noobish, but the second one is very nice. However, both are way too slow. Try to speed them up, even if you have to remove some minor effects.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for your FIRST positive comment. Yes, i know that. It is my first try to make my own DM with my own code. It simple, maybe somewhere noobish, but anyway that 2 presets better then my 20 last ones. I tried to remove some effects but my preset looks very cheap without them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yup... First preset, as Shock said, a bit simple, btw, can someone remind me what is nuclear winter (seems that i forgot)? Second one, yes it's nice, first fast brightness could be changed by doubling the numbers in conv. filter and takin fast bright. out, this seems to be a bit faster.</div></div><hr />
