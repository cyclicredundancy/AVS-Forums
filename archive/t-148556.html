<div class="posttext">Anyone check out the AVS in winamp 5?  I took a brief look at it, and it looks as though it is version 2.6.1, which is one whole minor number newer than the one in winamp3 :)  or am  i just on crack?</div></div><hr />

It's not out yet.  Wait for it to come out and then discuss.</div></div><hr />

Mentioning it in reference to AVS imnprovements is ok, just don't offer it for download.<br />
<br />
Justin's just done some new things for AVS:<br />
http://www.webdog.org/cgi-bin/finger.plm?id=314<br />
Added some new AVS effects, at mig's request. Gonna make AVS for<br />

<div class="posttext">But is that the upgrade like 2.5.1 that came with wa3. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Although I am not holding my breath about the new stuff just yet folks.<br />
<br />
Sadly effects can mean anything from a new preset or whatever. Still awaiting confirmation. It could be news we have all been waiting for  Stranger things have happened or maybe we have just had too much of moltarx's crack. :);)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Glad to see the new effects are at mig's request... they're bound to be jaw dropping if they come from a guy with such an enormous grasp over the power of AVS. Bound to be much better than the huge list in the AVS Wishlist forum from all of us lamers, I guess nullsoft keep visiting there and don't update AVS because our ideas are so lame.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Perhaps it's mig who is reading the forums and requesting the top wishlisted items to Justin who is too busy to check.  Perhaps you should reserve your comments until they come up with the new release...or fail to...<br />
<br />
Lack of time, resources, and manpower to develop doesn't make wishlisted ideas lame, just not doable.<br />

<div class="posttext">I &lt;3 all vis plugins.  I've still got a winamp folder full of every vis plugin I could find under the sun, from something like 3 years ago.<br />

Heh, I just recalled one of my early favorites, G-Force, and I went to check if andy o'meara still existed in online form and it seems he is about to release a new version...cool<br />

<div class="posttext">We'll see, I'm quite curious what they made of it :). I too wait before posting anything about it, till the final version is out. There could be some major improvements in AVS. Some extra effects are sweet, but removing bugs and other things mentioned in the wishlist would be great.</div></div><hr />

You do know that you can use either vis_avs 2.5.1 and vis_avs 2.6.1 on any version of Winamp 2x don't you? And switch between them whenever you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yes, but 2.91 has a few bugs that 2.81 doesn't have.  WA 2.91 AVS 2.51 is the best combination.</div></div><hr />
