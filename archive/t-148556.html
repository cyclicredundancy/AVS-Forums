      Anyone check out the AVS in winamp 5? I took a brief look at it, and it looks as though it is version 2.6.1, which is one whole minor number newer than the one in winamp3 :) or am i just on crack?</p>

      Although I am not holding my breath about the new stuff just yet folks.<br />

      Sadly effects can mean anything from a new preset or whatever. Still awaiting confirmation. It could be news we have all been waiting for Stranger things have happened or maybe we have just had too much of moltarx's crack. :);)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Glad to see the new effects are at mig's request... they're bound to be jaw dropping if they come from a guy with such an enormous grasp over the power of AVS. Bound to be much better than the huge list in the AVS Wishlist forum from all of us lamers, I guess nullsoft keep visiting there and don't update AVS because our ideas are so lame.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Perhaps it's mig who is reading the forums and requesting the top wishlisted items to Justin who is too busy to check. Perhaps you should reserve your comments until they come up with the new release...or fail to...<br />

      Lack of time, resources, and manpower to develop doesn't make wishlisted ideas lame, just not doable.<br />

      <p class="post-content">We'll see, I'm quite curious what they made of it :). I too wait before posting anything about it, till the final version is out.
