			<strong>vis transition in WA5</strong><br />
		
		

		Hey, I noticed something about newer versions of avs and winamp.  There is no auto-switching for vis-presets except with random switching every xxx seconds...  I can remember with winamp 2.76 or 2.78 (can't remember) there was an auto-switching that occured when the song changed; completely non-random.<br />
  Now, don't get upset about this, but what happened to that option.  Wait, wait, was it an APE that I may have dl'd?  I really liked seeing the transition when a song changed.  I don't mind the transition at random, but having such anal customizability is nice. :up: <br />
<br />
  Thanks :P<br />
<br />
 and BTW, I have searched pretty much all the avs help and tech info threads, only coming up with ppl who can't find the check box for turning on/off the random switching.  sheesh

Uhm... sorry, i posted a &quot;solution&quot; which didn't work at all after all :igor:<br />
[/edit]<br />
<br />
I have no idea how you could do this, maybe you could use Hotlist by magic-x? (search)

.<br />
  I never would have thought of that.<br />
.<br />
  ...<br />
.<br />
  I mean, really.  I had to rehinge my jaw when I got your reply.  Has this always been a feature? Or did it start with wa3?<br />
.<br />
  damn.<br />
.<br />
  you are definitely a Major Dude for  reasons just llike this.<br />
<br />
  Thanks :P<br />
<br />
  I just tried it and it f*ckin' worked!  I mean, WOW!  I can't really express how gratefull I am that feature is still there.  And the words escape me to give you the appropriate thanks for your help...  Thanks... :D

		You mean the hotlist or the wrong solution i posted, but erased a minute after?<br />
<br />
That setting to zero and then autoexecute thing didn't work afterall, i thought it worked, but further testing and i noticed that it... just didn't work :(<br />
<br />
You could still try hotlist?<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Oh and btw. the title &quot;major dude&quot; &quot;member&quot; &quot;forum king&quot; etc. they are based on the post count ;) (how many posts the user made to the forums since he joined) Not on anything else.<br />
<br />

Damn why didn't i think of this before? You can manually load a random preset in AVS by pressing space bar! :p<br />
Just do that everytime a new song starts or whenever you want ;)<br />
Make sure though that you have &quot;All&quot; in the &quot;Preset (sub) directory to use for random/cycle&quot; which is in the &quot;Presets/hotkeys&quot; menu of the avs editor.

		you can also press U if you want.<br />
But i think that this would be very great if the AVS could change every time the song changes, specialy if you have a visualization in a pub or a disco ;)

		sorry, you guys are of course correct on what you've said about the vis advancements.  I'm a dumbass :hang:, cause I thought it worked, and I didn't even look at it long enough to see it didn't (using 0 as the random switching interval).<br />
<br />
I guess I'll use hotlist, but I'd prefer the feature, as simple as it is, be built into either the avs or winamp itself.  I already know the shortcut key strokes to change the vis, but ... wait, I need to post this on the wish list now, don't I?  Well, thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
  My original question was, wasn't there an avs (or wvs) way back ( a few years ago) that came with winamp that had (random or not) vis switching when the song changed?  I wanna say it was 2.76, but I can't remember.  All I can remember is that it must have been an option in the wvs itself, cause what I want to happen now with the vis switching is what happened then... oh well.<br />
<br />
 BTW, Tuggummi, your presets rock.  And I still think you're a Major Dude, which I hope is a good thing.  :p
