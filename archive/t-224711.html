      <p class="post-content"><strong>Well hello</strong><br />
      Hey everybody. It's been awhile.<br />
      <br />
      I was at friends house the other day, and we were listening to muzak on his computer, and he had the windows media player visualizations on. And everybody was like "Man, I could just watch all these pretty swirly colors and stuff all day...." and so I was like, "Hey man, you haven't seen nothin until you checked out winamp's visualizations. They'll blow any other visualizations out of the water!" :p<br />
      <br />
      And then I was like, "wow, I haven't used AVS for a long time...." And somehow like 90% of my .ape files got deleted.<br />
      <br />
      So I was wondering, is there a certain place where I could find all the latest .apes and stuff?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ey PC! been a while indeed.<br />
      I don't know exactly when you left, but here I think these are the latest common ape's:<br />
      <br />
      &gt;Texer2 (I suppose you know it, it also comes with with winamp)<br />
      &gt;Color Map (ditto)<br />
      &gt;Jheriko's Global Variables Manager<br />
      &gt;TomyLobo's Resizer APE (for adjusting the editor size)<br />
      &gt;TomyLobo's AVStrans Automation (enables you to code.. differently - a bit more c++-like or so I've been told; Frankly I haven't looked into it yet)<br />
      &gt;TomyLobo's Triangle APE (for rendering solid objects)</p>
