<div class="posttext">Hey everybody.  It's been awhile.  <br />
<br />
I was at friends house the other day, and we were listening to muzak on his computer, and he had the windows media player visualizations on.  And everybody was like &quot;Man, I could just watch all these pretty swirly colors and stuff all day....&quot; and so I was like, &quot;Hey man, you haven't seen nothin until you checked out winamp's visualizations.  They'll blow any other visualizations out of the water!&quot; :p <br />
<br />
And then I was like, &quot;wow, I haven't used AVS for a long time....&quot; And somehow like 90% of my .ape files got deleted.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering, is there a certain place where I could find all the latest .apes and stuff?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ey PC! been a while indeed.<br />
I don't know exactly when you left, but here I think these are the latest common ape's: <br />
<br />
&gt;Texer2 (I suppose you know it, it also comes with with winamp)<br />
&gt;Color Map (ditto)<br />
&gt;Jheriko's Global Variables Manager<br />
&gt;TomyLobo's Resizer APE (for adjusting the editor size)<br />
&gt;TomyLobo's AVStrans Automation (enables you to code.. differently - a bit more c++-like or so I've been told; Frankly I haven't looked into it yet)<br />
&gt;TomyLobo's Triangle APE (for rendering solid objects)</div></div><hr />
