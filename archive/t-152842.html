			<strong>An AVS problem...</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm new to this forum so I don't know if this is the right place to post this or what, but I'll give it a shot anyway. So i go into my Winamp player (2.91) and try to start up the AVS visualizatins. They don't come up... What happens is it looks like it is coming up, the screen flashes, the avs box comes up, then it immediatly goes away like I closed it. This sux big time because because the AVS is my favorite :cry: But all my other vis. work fine (Geiss, Tripex3, etc.)I do remember changing one of my settings before this happened, but I can't configure the damned thing because it won't let me open it! :mad: I have no idea what to to guys, help me out will ya? Maybe there is a way to clear the settings or somthing?

		Well I'd say download the newest version of winamp if you dont have it yet and just reinstall.  Thats the easiest way as long as you back up your presets, but I doubt it'll erase them anyways.

		what you need is an old version of winamp with an old version of avs (2.5(.1)).  winamp 2.91 ships with 2.6, which is SHITE and bugs more than the west nile virus (ahahaha i kill me...get it...<u>kill</u>...oh nevermind).  or you could root around a bit in teh forums here and find one of the 2.7 leaks that are completely illegal and people will hunt you down and kill you if you ever mention it to anybody.<br />

		It actually sounds like you put the window outside of where the resolution could see it by accident. Probably could've fixed it by setting a higher resolution, moving the window when you can see it and then changing back.

		I had this happen to me, except I was using Winamp 3, it was right when it just came out, and after that I just droped it. Why don't you just post a Winamp5 leak next time Atero?

		I don't think it was what Raz said, because if the AVS window was outside the screen, you wouldn't even see it for a flash. It only becomes visible after the move.<br />
<br />
An other option was that there was a bad/corrupt preset active, which would crash AVS as soon as it started. The last preset is saved as vis_avs.dat along with the plug-in (vis_avs.dll), so next time you experience something like that, try deleting vis_avs.<b>dat</b> (not dll).

		You could also check Winamp.ini for the current settings of AVS. (For the out of screen case)
