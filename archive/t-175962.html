      this is my second posted preset. It's not perfect, but I like it a lot.<br />
      Have a look at it and tell me what you think, please. (also tell me what's wrong or what i could do better)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Quite nice. Try to do something a little more imaginitive with textures. The moving particles and water thing has been done by everyone when they start out. Just try experimenting with more of the effects and see what you come up with.<br />
      <br />
      Is that your own DM? If so it's a good start, no unnecessary bits and randomly thrown in stuff. However simple it may be you know what you're doing when you do it, which is always good.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The DM is my own work. It took me a very long time to figure out how it works. It still does things that i didn't expect, and for the 3D Movement I tried almost 2 days to make it work. I did a lot of C programming in my first year at university, so I don't like it when there's unnessasary code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">really good for a start!<br />
      to reduce the distortion in the distance try some alphablending:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />alpha=20-sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y));<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      This line will fade the texture out after 10 repetitions.<br />
      To use it, activate the "Blend" checkbox on the DM and set "source" to "Buffer 1"<br />
      Next, add a Misc/Buffer Save (Buffer 1, Replace) and a Render/Clear Screen (black or whatever you like :) ) before it.<br />
      <br />
      By doing this you tell AVS to first copy your texture to a buffer, clear the screen and then use the buffer in the DM. Alpha blending then blends between the black (or whatever you choose) screen and the image your DM produces.<br />
      I bet this step allows better movement :)<br />
      <br />
      and for the (evil) back plane. this is a normal by-product of raytracing. It's the 2nd solution to the raytracing equation and is actually *behind* the camera. you can get rid of it by extending the above equation to<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />alpha=(20-sqrt(sqr(x)+sqr(y)))*above(z,-1);<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      This line sets alpha to zero if z is lower than or equal to -1(you camera is at z=-1).

      <p class="post-content">Thank you. I really wondered how to get rid of those distortions. It looks better now in the distance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i modified the DM a bit and attached it<br />
      i added a smoother fadeout at the borders and made z relative to the camera<br />
      i also added a circular movement<br />
      <br />
      btw please read that sticky post by UnConeD about posting presets. Like him, I have a big folder where all the downloaded presets go and when I want to see a preset, I start by looking for the name of the author.</p>
