			<strong>Few questions about AVS... (advanced stuffs)</strong><br />
		
		

		I kinda still have a lot to learn 'bout AVS...<br />
Here are the load of questions :p<br />
<br />
How do you make a whole screen-grid using only 1 SSC?<br />
<br />
Another SSC question : How can I make a line SSC, in which somewhere along the SSC, there's a line perpendicular to the first line, but still using the same SSC? (I gonna use this to make a Tetris preset I've planned to make... making a Tetris shapes lens DMs are easy, but using SSC... I can't =( )(I'll also edit line width, so just need the skeleton)<br />
<br />
I know it won't help me, but what is the gridsize of Trans/Movement?<br />
<br />
How to make a DM Lens that is curved nicely from edge to middle?<br />
To explain :<br />
Like the lens in UnConeD's Second Reality, not like in :<br />
<br />
d=if(band(band(above(x,-.5),below(x,.5)),band(above(y,-.5),below(y,.5))),d/2,d);<br />
<br />
Answers to the question would be very appreciated =)

		I don't think movement has a grid size, I believe it does all the pixels in the render.<br />
<br />
As to the rest, no idea.

				How do you make a whole screen-grid using only 1 SSC?</blockquote>
The trick here is to throw <i>i</i> out the window... it's inaccurate due to round-off errors. Also remember that you can set <i>n</i> in every frame. So basically we need to make a variable <i>xp</i> (xposition) traverse every value from 0 to <i>w</i> (width), while <i>yp</i> traverses every position from 0 to [i]h[ (height).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it's best to use w+1 and h+1 for width and height. If you don't, you'll get nasty round-off errors too.<br />
<br />
So, in onframe:<br />
<br />

	<pre><code>ww</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">w</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">hh</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">h</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">n</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">ww</span><span style="color: #007700">*</span><span style="color: #0000BB">hh</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">0</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">yp</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">0</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">iw</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">/</span><span style="color: #0000BB">ww</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">ih</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">/</span><span style="color: #0000BB">hh</span><span style="color: #007700">;
</code></pre>
	
<i>iw</i> and <i>ih</i> are the inverted (adjusted) width and height, calculated only once every frame to speed the preset up... multiplication is several times faster than division.<br />
<br />
In per point:<br />
<br />

	<pre><code>x</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">*</span><span style="color: #0000BB">iw</span><span style="color: #007700">*</span><span style="color: #0000BB">2</span><span style="color: #007700">-</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">y</span><span style="color: #007700">=</span><span style="color: #0000BB">yp</span><span style="color: #007700">*</span><span style="color: #0000BB">ih</span><span style="color: #007700">*</span><span style="color: #0000BB">2</span><span style="color: #007700">-</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">;
<br />
<br />.....
<br />
<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">=if(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">above</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">,</span><span style="color: #0000BB">ww</span><span style="color: #007700">),</span><span style="color: #0000BB">0</span><span style="color: #007700">,</span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">);
<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">yp</span><span style="color: #007700">=if(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">xp</span><span style="color: #007700">,</span><span style="color: #0000BB">yp</span><span style="color: #007700">,</span><span style="color: #0000BB">yp</span><span style="color: #007700">+</span><span style="color: #0000BB">1</span><span style="color: #007700">);
</code></pre>
	
First, we transform the variables xp,yp in the range (0..ww, 0..hh) into AVS coordinates (-1..1, -1..1), by dividing by width and height, and multiplying by 2 and subtracting 1.<br />
<br />
Then, at the end, we increase <i>xp</i> by one. When it equals the width, we set it back to zero. <br />
<i>yp</i> is increased only when <i>xp</i> is zero. Note that this doesn't happen the first time around (because <i>xp</i> will equal 1 after the first pixel). So you have a pretty grid that fills the full screen... but it's slow as hell. Speed-up tips include skipping every uneven pixel and using lines to get a 'pixel-doubled' grid.

		If you want to make one superscope which consists of multiple disconnected line segments, you'll need to use a render-mode like Additive or Maximum, and simply set the color to black when you don't want a line to be drawn. A good example is my Plankton preset... all the swimming particles are only one SSC, and you can see this by turning off the blendmode change.

		Umm, I think I need to rephrase my Tetris SSC question a bit, this time in form of a different question...<br />
<br />
How do you make a &quot;T&quot; using one SSC?<br />
An &quot;l&quot; With horizontally laid &quot;T&quot; on top of it using one SSC?<br />
<br />
(In other words, the shpae itself... :p )

		Probably something like this:<br />
<br />
<pre><code><br />
1----------&gt;2   -----3&lt;----2  -----3-----<br />
                                   |<br />
                                   |<br />
                                   v<br />
                                   4<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
Use if's in a 4 point superscope to set the coordinates accordingly each time.

		Hmm, but what Variable?<br />
I tried using If(equal(n,#) , but doesn't work...<br />
<br />
Hmm, possibly I'd have to use 2-3 synchronized SSCs...<br />
<br />
So, my (probably :p ) last question :<br />
<br />
What is the min/max value of Getosc/Getspec command?

		i'd do something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;u=i*n&quot;<br />
<br />
-&gt; that way, u contains a number 0, 1, 2, 3... up to 'n'. Then use that in if statements.

		Tried that, didn't work... :cry:<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
Try this : (any variable)=n*i-i  :D<br />
<br />
<i>That</i> works! (All that problem, and one simple formula...)<br />
<br />
I use p for the variable - stands for &quot;point&quot;...<br />
<br />
And of course, only the coordinates of the point is the only thing needed to be done, using &quot;i&quot; won't work (remember, when SSC is set on lines, it will automatically draw line from n#1 to n#2 to n#3... but not last n to first n)<br />
The Tetris shapes are rather easy to make once the formula above come into use...<br />
<br />
Hmm, now if only I can make a smooth lens, not a lens with the edge a bit too obvious...

		For a good lens... first of all, you need a good view on mathematical functions.<br />
<br />
Try the following superscope:<br />
<br />
u=i*2-1;<br />
x=u;y=-(u*u);<br />
<br />
This will draw a parabola... because the relationship between any variable 'x' and its square 'x*x' is shaped like that. Similary, a linear relationship f(x) = a*x (where a is any real number) is a straight line passing through the origin. Try visualising math functions this way. Fill this in in the superscope: y=-(sin(u)); Now try y=-(sin(u*2)); This has the effect that the graph is 'squished' horizontally, so you see more of it.<br />
<br />
What am I getting at? Well... the distortion you want is probably that you're changing a 'd' based on a specific formula. I also suppose that you use something like d=if(below(d, 0.5), ..., ...) to keep the lens small. So what you want now is a function that bulges/enlarges when 'd' is inside your interval, and is nicely linear (i.e. doesn't change d) outside. You also need to make sure that, when d is on the edge of the lens, there is no sudden jump in value.<br />
<br />
Here's a good example:<br />
<br />
y=-(if(below(abs(u),.5),abs(u)*u*2,u));<br />
<br />
If you remove/change the *2, you'll see that the graph is no longer continuous. I also made sure that the function behaves appropriately for negative values, but for 'd' values, which are positive-only, that's not even necessary. Of course, I'm not sure if this will look like a convincing lens, but you should be able to figure out an appropriate formula yourself.<br />
<br />
For better plotting of mathematical functions, you need a good math program... but for a quick look, a superscope will do :).
