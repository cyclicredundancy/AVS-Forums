		I don't think you can be able embed avs in web browser.<br />
because AVS don't discribe in web browser.

		you mean putting an avs in your own site?<br />
you could make an AVI from it, using <a href="http://www.acko.net" target="_blank">UnConeD</a> <a href="http://www.acko.net/files/avsgrabber2.zip" target="_blank">AVSGrabber APE</a><br />
after compressing it you could embed it in your web page, but don't ask me about details on that, i never used any videos in web pages<br />
<br />
directly putting an AVS on a website could be done if someone wrote a plug-in for it, but it would be worthless i think because it depends on sound input.

		Or there's the overlay color mode where every pixel that corresponds to the color you set will turn into a part of the AVS window.<br />
<br />
Kinda not what you're going for, I know.

		i don't think he meant overlay mode<br />
1. you'd have to zoom the preset according to the position of the canvas in the browser<br />
2. it would not show up on other people's browsers

		I think he was referring to creating his own browser in which he wants to load the data given from (the user's) AVS.<br />
<br />
Then you'd have to write some sort of APE that like AVSgrabber writes data to an external file, but removes again at (almost) the same time to save memory. Some sort of internal streaming media.

		he talked about a web browser, so i think he meant IE<br />
that internal streaming thing... pretty weird idea ^^ if you're trying to do this, use sockets instead :)<br />
maybe turn it into a streaming video webserver with sound from winamp and video from avs :)<br />
just a crazy idea :D

		If you know Java, then you'll know that applets run in a sandbox environment which shields them from the OS. Platform-specific apps like AVS or Winamp are not accessible to Java afaik.<br />
<br />
I suppose you could program your own visualiser thingie, but without optimized instructions (and given Java's general slowless) it wouldn't run well.

try <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com" target="_blank">SHOUTcast</a><br />
it's an audio streaming relay server and you can use it to let people listen to whatever you are listening to atm (input can come directly from winamp through a DSP plugin)<br />
if you plan on broadcasting .wma files you might need <a href="http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=80454" target="_blank">this</a>

		I dunno, is there a program that could stream the output of the AVS Grabber? Either that, or there might be a program that could stream a image of your desktop or something. <br />
<br />
Or you could just rig a webcam up and point it at your monitor :P

Actually Me and GordoN Willaim (r4) have been working on realtime visual on teh web and Java is surprising quick. We did think that we would have big problems with it for our client but not at all.<br />
<br />
You can get a GForce/Geiss type effect in a decent/reasonable size window for running sweet on a 500mHz machine.<br />
<br />
Obviously no 3d technology in there but decent never-the-less.<br />
<br />
When the deal is all completed I'll post what we have.

Yathosho once did this with NSV (Nullsoft Streaming Video). You can find a forum about it on these forums.

I think that either me or you dont know java so well...:)<br />
I know that the sandbox is there only if you run an unsigned applet...:) did you know that?

Yes I do, but:<br />
- I don't see how you could use even a non-sandboxed Java applet to extract the AVS stuff from a 3rd party /native/ Windows program. Even in a native Windows app it's practically impossible, unless you start fucking around and using native API calls to hook into various Windows subsystems.<br />
- I know 90% of all visitors will click 'no' at the first sight of any security warning (which a signed applet gives you afaik).

		the problem is: you'd have to run winamp and AVS from that plugin. maybe just AVS if you know how to call it.<br />
but UnConeD's right: the security warning (and the fact that this is the common way dialers spread) messes everything up<br />
<br />
instead, make 2 links:<br />
link #1 to the stream<br />
link #2 to an AVS pack/Hotlist config file :)

*grins*<br />
I think AVS is a bit too complex to be rewritten. <br />
<br />
The hardest thing will probably be convincing all APE authors to rewrite their plugins in Java :)<br />
<br />
Then you need a code parser, which is really hard, but maybe you can find one already written in Java. After all, the AVS syntax is not too far away from Java/PHP/Perl/C. But then, to make the whole thing effective, you'll *need* to compile the script parts to bytecode, so they can be executed on demand<br />
This alone needs in-depth knowledge of the Java VM.<br />
<br />
Next, you'll need to know how all the standard effect components of AVS work (like blur, dynamic movement, etc.)<br />
<br />
If you're then done with all that work (after maybe 5 years or so :) ), Nullsoft will probably have released several new versions of AVS, and your work goes on :)
