<div class="posttext">I tried to stay away from avs but i couldn't...<br />
<br />
So i decided to make a pack or a minipack of 3D presets, you know grind out the basics and classics so i won't do those again :D<br />
<br />
Anyway here is the second preset created for the pack, a (suprise suprise!) tunnel dm :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy, i know i will :)</div></div><hr />

me?  I don't think I qualify.  Hell, I'm having trouble just learning to raytrace - the texturing part is confusing me.  Of course I'm not that great at DMs, SSCs are more my thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">13373571</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th July 2003, 08:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">texturing example:<br />
<br />
x=ix<br />
<br />
with this code, a DM will take the color of the point at ix and map it onto x. ix is the universal x coordinate of the intersection point.  That's all you need to know.  Another way of looking at it is that you will wallpaper your surface with the original image and that the x of the original image will be aligned with the x of the surface.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm just wondering, why not ray trace?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because i don't know how :) Simple enough? I don't know how to do ray trace, i just learned the basics of 3D rotation (which i don't understand but i know what to use to get the end result)<br />
<br />
Basicly, i don't understand a dick what im doing, i just bang my head to the keyboard like the million monkeys until something comes out of it :p<br />
<br />
And those posts about ray-tracing, 3D objects, Cameras, etc. They help me none, how the hell i could understand them when i don't even understand the basics of trigo...the fucking hard word for geometric math or something...<br />
<br />
Im stupid, leave me alone!!! :blah:<br />
<br />
I just do stuff, how i do it, is my business :)</div></div><hr />

ANd don't be calling me no technical genious (ok maybe just once :D) I'm too sparse and lazy to be a genious. I make about a preset every 3 weeks or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've already done quite a lot of it, i was working on a big crazy remix that didn't quite work out and then i broke what i had and didn't save sort of situation, i got some understanding out of it though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">With UnConeD's zero g-maze 3, the most confusing part I'm finding in it is how his camera rotation works, I have been able to isolate and control most of his other variables, but I can't get his stupid camera rotation to work! It was really fun ripping apart WolfenAVStein3d though :-) , but back to Tuggumi's preset, I have to say it runs really good on my computer, I was looking at his coding today and not only does it run faster on my computer then a raytraced DM, but it is also 10x easier to change things in it then a raytraced DM, but I also like all the different shapes of tunnels/planes you can make with yours by changing things in the 3-D to 2-D section.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Yeah I read the comment, I wasn't confused by the different phases it used to move, but the way it was coded to smoothly transition from rotation to acclereating to slowing down then reseting. I looked it over the past day, and I spent a while changing variables and messing around with different lines of code, and I'm pretty sure I got it now, the only thing I need to do now is try and make my own from scratch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The reason i'm not a big technical genious isn't to do with my DM skills though, it's my scoping skills, i know basically how everything works and what to do to get x effect but i want to get more complex.<br />
<br />
Raz opens up pickin dim 3 and goes off on a decoding spree. This could take a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">From the list of all the technical geniues you forgot Zevensoft. How dare you? :igor: I think Zevensoft is far more closer to &quot;UnConeD level&quot; than any of the other ones :D<br />
<br />
Uhm... i'll go back to the offline land now...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cant watch the preset now - no winamp:(<br />
<br />
Raz watch out for usles pieces of code which are there from previous versions!<br />
<br />
BTW all the ssc are useing the basic trig stuff except magnarings which includes some primary school phisics:D. So plz stop calling me a SSC genious it hurts. Practicaly everyone around here knows more math then me (ok maybee Tugg doesnt:D:P).<br />
<br />
Btw does anyone know how to bend stuff like a bend modifier does in 3d modelers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th July 2003, 19:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok so your not a math genious, but you sure as hell know how to manipulate scopes with what you do know.<br />
<br />
And i'm still going on a decoding spree. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th July 2003, 19:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">fsk: those are just transformations that involve rotations and/or skewing, where the angle or distance depends on the coordinates.<br />
<br />
A bend is where you rotate the coordinates in a plane, and the rotation angle is dependant on a coordinate along a vector in that plane.<br />
E.g. bend an object in the XY plane, where the rotation angle for point (x,y,z) equals the x coordinate.<br />
<br />
A twist/torsion is where the rotation angle in a plane is dependant on a coordinate along a vector perpendicular/normal to that plane.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check the attachment and note the only difference between the two is the plane in which rotation occurs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Do you know thw rabbit hole for sonique?<br />
I want it for winamp. This tunnel is similar but i want remove the rotation. May you help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th July 2003, 15:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Miketrevis:<br />
<br />
In the Trans / Dynamic Movement you will find in the Frame section these code lines:<br />
xr=xr+xrs ;<br />
yr=yr+yrs ;<br />
zr=zr+zrs ;<br />
<br />
Change those code lines to:<br />
<br />
xr=0 ;<br />
yr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
zr=0 ;<br />
<br />
This will stop the rotation completely, if you want to rotate the tunnel end so it will be horizontally wider just use:<br />
<br />
xr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
yr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
zr=0 ;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And no i haven't seen any sonique vis's (well except those i have seen used in avs presets) So i wouldn't know what you are talking about :)<br />
<br />
If you want a &quot;true&quot; rabbit hole preset, check out El-vis's Cyberpunx Pack you can find on the classic.winamp.com site (just search with the word el-vis)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Miketrevis, just change the 0.05 to a minus one too :)<br />
<br />
i.e. slide=slide-speed-boost-0.05 ;<br />

Then it will be the perfect opposite of the original.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Then you will have to seek out something else. tunnels that bend are pretty hard to make with a dynamic movement... atleast i don't know how. And there is nothing you can do with this preset that could make it like molehole.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wonder if anyone has made a bending tunnel dynamic movement, closest I can think of is UnConeD's Speeder 3K, it doesn't really bend, and it'snot really a tunnel though.</div></div><hr />

and i'm fairly sure that a bending tunnel is impossible in dm, or at least extremely hard and would require some major code hacks.</div></div><hr />
