		I have decided that it is now time for me to submit my presets.  Don't have high expectations - just keep an open mind.  Please do remixes.  Be sure to read the text document - it explains it all.<br />
<br />
looking forward to your feedback<br />
<br />

		Hi Tonestar and welcome to the AVS community! Here's my review of your pack: <br />
<br />
<b>lava lamp:</b> Wow, a very nice and original use of the moving particles. Somewhat bland, but nice to look at. 3/5<br />
<b>interference:</b> Excellent use of code! There's a good tunnel movement hidden in there (hint: lower one of the numbers). Keep working with this! 3.5/5<br />
<b>technicolour2:</b> Ooh, this is a little chaotic. I don't think anything can save this. 2/5<br />
<b>technicolour3:</b> It's a definite improvement, but a still a little too psychedelic for my taste. 2.5/5<br />
<b>technicolour:</b> Do NOT use a heavy blur in direct contact with water! I can't emphasise this strongly enough. But it's still good. 2.5/5<br />
<b>Colour Pool:</b> Ahh, my eyes! Just kidding, but this is not very nice. 2/5<br />
<b>Pastel:</b> Who'd have known that something so simple can make such an impact? Nice work, despite its lack of dynamics. 2.5/5<br />
<b>Colourology:</b> This is a little too similar to technicolour. You've got some components in there that are unactivated as well. Still okay though. 2/5<br />
<b>psychocolour:</b> Hmm, looked better with the water off. It's more ambient that way, and ambient is always good. 2.5/5<br />
<br />
<b>The verdict:</b> A good start. A few gems in there, but choked somewhat by slight repetition and a small pack size. Be careful about using water too often. And always beware of CHAOS! :)<br />
<br />
<b>Aesthetics:</b> :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
<b>Originality:</b> :) :) :( :( :( 1/2<br />
<b>Overall:</b> :) :) :( :( :( 1/2

		Thanks for the genuine comments guys!<br />
I actually expected a worse response from all you guys, but maybe you were just being nice there Undefined  ;) <br />
<br />
I should have mentioned that many of those presets were made right at the start of my AVS experimentation (particularly the technicolour set - which explains paramaters which don't work).  Also I aught to have warned that they were all psychidelic presets - some love them, some don't love them.<br />
<br />
Looking back, I now realise that I did put in several that were too similar, so I do agree with you that there was too much repetition.  I guess the reason for that is that it was some of my earlier work when I fell into the &quot;ooh look at the pretty colours&quot; trap.<br />
<br />
It is a while since I reviewed those ones, so keep an eye out for refined versions in the future.<br />
<br />
If I caught any attention with that pack, then here is a another of mine - which I think is better; (well at least not so repetitive anyway) just don't expect any superscopes yet.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the unfiltered crap.<br />
<br />
T.D.

		Tut tut, Tonestar. I'm not going to toe the line with reviews. If I don't like something I'll definitely say so. :)<br />
<br />
BTW I checked out your other stuff as well. Some nice effects in there as well! Except I do have one gripe, a pretty serious one at that. In SunStar, the movement looked similar to that of Zen-X's Rush. I compared the expressions, and (to quote Nic01) what do you know. Exact match. :hang: At least some credit would've been in order.

		OOPS!<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to nick anyone's codes or anything.  I realised that someone else probably coded the sunstar movement - I just couldn't remember who.<br />
Credit then to Zen-x.

		ok<br />
I might as well let everyone see my best work to date before I hide away in my little corner from where I came, and work on making some kick ass visuals that everyone will love.<br />
<br />
This set is the set of visuals which I think are my best.  Hopefully there is stuff which is original, or stuff which someone will like.  Again, I give anyone license to remix, as long as they let me see their versions of my work.<br />
<br />
happy AVSing<br />
T.D.

		No holding back here, I will just review every vis in the pack, since I don't know/care what pack they're from.<br />
<br />
Lavalamp - Weird...Looks like paint.  4/5<br />
Interference - I have attached a preset that shows the Interference code well, and this looks like something out of a bull. nice first try anyway.  1/5<br />
Technicolor - What a load of CRAP! 1/5<br />
Technicolor2 - Getting better... 2/5<br />
Technicolor3 - There we go...needs some work but it's one of many keepers. 4/5 (Little tip: Using the blur makes the image look better!)<br />
Colour Pool - Can I guess you're either Canadian or French?  anyway, What the HELL were you smoking? 1/5<br />
Pastel - This is Excelent!  I love this one too! 5/5<br />
Colourolgy - Same as Technicolor, only a little harder and not much in a warp sence.  3.5/5<br />
Psychocolor - See Colour Pool.  1/5<br />
Sun - Reminds me of the suns that you see in Sonic 2 or the like...3/5<br />
Clouds - Nice...But where are the clouds? 2/5<br />
Cloudsmk2 - See above. 2/5<br />
Star Voyage - Find my &quot;Riding the Nebula&quot; in this forum.  Learn from that.  3/5<br />
Sunstar - The spot bounces too much, add a dot in the middle and it will be nice. 3/5<br />
Solar Eclipse - Nice.  Relaxing...zZzZzZz... 4/5<br />
Nebula Journey (NDE)2 - Small question, what's NDE? nice preset anyway.  4/5<br />
Degauss - See Colour Pool.  This is a bit better. 2/5<br />
Degauss-Bumpy Remix - I like this, it looks excellent.  4/5<br />
Colour TV - This is like an APE that was on AVS.  TV.ape.  Nicely done...needs more though... 3/5<br />
Confetti - Nice!  It looks good.  4/5<br />
Cool - Of all the words in the english language...the name is not a description of this one. To repetitive.  2/5<br />
Mandala - Sweet, but needs more colors. 4.5/5<br />
Mandala2 - Nice...reminds me of Technicolor3 and Mandala. 3/5<br />
Hypnotic Stage Lights - Yes...kill the admin...kill bill gates...buhhhhh... 5/5<br />
Kinda Cool - See name.  2/5<br />
By Jove that's about right! - ...?  2/5<br />
Not Bad - I'd not say that about this preset!  Just having a slight trouble with remixing it.  5/5<br />
Through the Eye - I don't see the eye... 3/5<br />
<br />
<br />
Total of pack<br />

		NDE stands for Near Death Experience.  I haven't had one, but I saw a programme on them, and the images they showed of what people saw were so amazing.  I tried to recreate a near death experience vis, but I ended up with that.  I'm working on a good NDE vis though.<br />
<br />
Through the eye - the idea behind that one is that you are actually travelling through someone's eye (someone with a blue eye at that).<br />
<br />
And no don't insult me - I'm not French or Canadian.<br />
<br />
And I do agree some of my naming got bland.  Truth is some of those I just couldn't be screwed coming up with good names for.<br />
<br />
Well I'm enjoying all the promising feedback.  I think I need to go away now and do some remixing, and show you guys the new and improved pack from Tonest@r Deluxe.<br />
<br />
I'm still yet to see any remixes from anyone else, but hey that doesn't matter - I'll give them something to remix!<br />
<br />

		For this review, I'll only mention the presets that you should take a second look at, whether it's because it's bad or good...<br />
<br />
Lava Lamp - Delete blur, turn on Bilinear Filtering on Movement (Some speed improvement). It's quite static, but it's quite a good job for a beginner anyways.<br />
<br />
Pref : Put fadeout on top, set normal size to minimum for Particles (And set &quot;Default Render Blend&quot;), delete the ones which aren't RGB (And duplicate one of them, change it to white, put it on the bottom of particles, put it on white, put it with slightly less onBeat change)<br />
Replace the movement with a rotoblitter (And edit it as you desire).<br />
<br />
Interference - Yikes, too chaotic... I like it a little better when the d*256 is off the first movement... Now, if there can be a better color-job...<br />
<br />
Technicolour - Reminds me a bit too much of Lava Lamp...<br />
<br />
Colour Pool - Not many people liked these kinds of presets...<br />
<br />
Colorogy - Looks like Technicolour without the colorfade... You're using the firewurx a bit too much, don't you think?<br />
<br />
Clouds and Cloudsmk2 - Didn't see much difference.<br />
<br />
Solar Eclipse - There's a thin line between tranquility and boredom... This one's in the &quot;static&quot; group of presets... Hardly any movement.<br />
<br />
Nebula Journey 2 - Quite nice, especially knowing that you're a beginner... It gets a bit... Never mind...<br />
<br />
Degauss - Great!<br />
<br />
Cool - Cool! Quite good!<br />
<br />
Degauss - Bumpy Remix - A lot like Degauss... I like the texture you put on it... There's a lot of optimizations needed to be done there, and the bump is virtually uselesss.<br />
<br />
Hypnotic Stage Lights - Quite nice...<br />
_______<br />
<br />
You're off to a nice start... most of the presets are a bit static (can't blame anyone though :p )...<br />
Your presets are also heavily cluttered and needs some optimizations... I'd say I'll leave it to others to see and tell you the clutters...<br />
<br />
Overall : 3-3.5/5 stars.

		Tonest@r how can you make the &quot;Not Bad&quot; Preset have text?  I can't figure it out, and it removes the effects.

		To make a text visible, you can use additive blend (Adds a nasty blue hue), or put it in a list with replace on, and set fx list output to max blend. Slower, but no nasty blueness.<br />
--------------<br />
Degauss - Kaleidoscopic Mix - I don't see much difference...<br />
<br />
Degauss - Hall Of Mirrors Mix - Not much difference... only zoomed out to 1/3 of the original size, I guess...<br />
<br />
Hypnotic Sun (And with beams) - A bit too bright, perhaps... And what's with the comment?<br />
--------------<br />
Not much of an improvement over the original presets :( Keep trying anyways!
