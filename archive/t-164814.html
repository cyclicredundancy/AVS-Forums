<div class="posttext">Done for quite some time now, and submitted it to winamp.com about 1.5 month ago, though it's still not there :mad:. So here you go, my newest pack :D. Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
And ffs, don't ignore this post for a change ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OK, here goes:<br />
<br />
After the last preset, I really had the feeling of &quot;Ahh, is it over already?!?&quot; and that is a good thing<br />
A good mix between object-based and movement based presets.<br />
<br />
Review<br />
(Since you're Dutch, I'll give you extra points, 'kay? ;) )<br />
<br />
-Intro<br />
The name-in-a-rotating-circle has been done before, but there's more. <br />
The flames around look pretty good. 3/5<br />
-Data Traffic<br />
A rotating computerized.. digital.. errrm.. thingey.<br />
The background filling lines keep you wondering if the're in 3D, and that's neccessary(sp), because the preset would be kinda repetative if they weren't. 3/5<br />
-Blue Orb<br />
I didn't know that a tunnel could be done so easily, might try it out some day ;) 3.5/5<br />
-Planet X molecules<br />
lol@ the story...<br />
These presets have been done many times, but an explosion occurs every time two dots collide, right? 2.75/5<br />
-Mystique<br />
Here's something I really like, a bit too bright for my taste, though. 4/5<br />
-Play the guitar<br />
I'd wish to see if his fingers match the music that's played... 3.5/5<br />
-Smurry<br />
Somehow this reminds me of my nostrals(sp) when I had a flu a few weeks ago... Smooth colors 4/5<br />
-Mondriaan on drugs<br />
Perhaps this is what his last (unfinished) painting was going to look like... 3.75/5<br />
-Probing<br />
A nice tentacle-type preset. perhaps you should let the rings start a bit further off the viewpoint, they seem to invert. 3.5/5<br />
-Emanio<br />
I could watch this for a long time, it's great! 4.5/5<br />
-Pulse<br />
Smooth, I love it 4.25/5<br />
-Winternight Snowballs<br />
I've seen this before, but a bit different (morphing and stuff), just don't know where. Won't rate it until i know more. :igor:<br />
-Tartarus's precision<br />
The grain filter is really coming to it's right here. Fire is realistic too 4.5/5<br />
-Outro &amp; credits<br />
I always thought that this should be the last preset in a pack... I love the colorful text, although I hardly can't read it, a border or so should fix this. 3.75/5<br />
-Planet X molecuses Gaekwad2 remix<br />
Shinier, but often overbrightend, but then, what do I know since I've never been there ;).<br />
<br />
My overall rating: 3.8/5<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I was first to download, first to comment and first to rate the new Deamon pack :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Maybe I will, I don't have a DevArt account. I guess I can make one :).<br />

<br />
<br />
They aren't ;)<br />

<br />
Something like this? :D (see sig) My first AVS pack is in there as well, which is never published on winamp, though don't expect too much from it ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'd always highly recommend submitting to DA before finally releasing on winamp.com.  This way, you get some really good comments on how to improve your pack before the huge release.</div></div><hr />
