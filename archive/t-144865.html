			<strong>Bye Everybody</strong><br />
		
		

		(note: i'm not posting from my house so right now i'm typing on a qwerty keyboard, thus there's probably gonna be some typos (e.g. s's instead of o's and d's instead of e's in common words))<br />
<br />
I've decided to quit AVSing &quot;full time&quot; and move onto better things.  Namely my music, which I've been neglecting quite a bit recently.  I'll still come online from time to time to post but it won't be much.  Same with AVSing - eventually I'll finish TFF4; AVS primer is still in the works but it should be up soon (at least the first part of it.<br />
There's a couple reasons I've decided to quit.  Mostly, I'm just not that good of an AVSer to make it worth my while.  As I stated before, I need to start focusing on my music.  Lastly, I really need to tear myself away from the computer - it's become an addiction and I'm tired of it being that way.<br />
<br />
So goodbye to all of my friends, a big last &quot;fuck you&quot; to the entire AVS forums, and if you don't have my complete works in AVS and beyond, download them from <a href="http://atero.sectionz.com" target="_blank">http://atero.sectionz.com</a> and <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com." target="_blank">http://atero.deviantart.com.</a>  I LOVE YOU ALL (except some - you know who you are ;))<br />
<br />
<br />
...YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOI!<br />

		Well I hope you have fun with your music and be sure to finish your AVS primer so we can tell all the n00bs to look at it! I still am looking forward to TFF4 though. I hope you have a better time away from AVS with the real world.

		Well, there goes another AVSer.  Hopefully you'll come back sometime later.  I'll try to watch your music making - you better make some good stuff. :p <br />

Do you normally use a dvorak keyboard?

		i forgot to mention the part about how i've pretty much given up on avs being updated in the least.  If it were I'd stick around...but...ffs, it's been what, a couple YEARS since a real update?  there's just nothing new anymore<br />
<br />
except for the one thing that pushed me - a new dm from unconed and jheriko; the first truly original thing i've seen in months.  i've been doing this for a year and a half, and I've done two original things in that time, and I'm not planning on doing anymore.  I'm just tired of it.  There's nothing out there left to do...and if there is it's not going to be mine, so there's really no point in trying anymore.

It'll be a shame to see you go... there aren't that many of us who are willing to dedicate so much of our time to sitting down and figuring out new things (or at least trying to).

I never told you that Flocks is a masterpiece. However I don't think that reviving old threads will be fun anymore. Please come back from time to time to diss us. Plus bananas don't smell like potatoes. AVS doesn't either. :blah:
