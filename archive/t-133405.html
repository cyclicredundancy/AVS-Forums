<div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
First, I'm new to these boards, so forgive me if this is the wrong forum for this question. I'll cheerfully move it to the correct one.<br />
<br />
My question is about the AVS overlay mode (it works great for me, this is not a &quot;how do i turn it on&quot; post). I've searched all the winamp forums (and google) to no avail, so I'm posting. <br />
<br />
How would one add a similar mode to AVS overlay mode in an application? I'm guessing it uses DirectDraw (7?) overlay surfaces, and have played with these, but can't seem to draw to the desktop background (yes the destination color key and desktop color match), it draws on top of everything else. If anyone has any tips/code/links for me, I'd appreciate it. Any links to a DirectX help forum that might be able to answer this would also be welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks folks.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Make sure the key is exactly the same, if you're off one value it won't work.<br />
<br />
This isn't exactly the 'wrong' forum in terms of topic, but you won't find many programmers here. Try flipcode.com, there's lots of knowledgable programmers there.<br />
<br />
Overlay mode is commonly used by movie players (so that the hardware performs the blitting/rescaling rather than the software), maybe you can look into that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, I'll check out flipcode, thanks. I guess I shouldn't expect the AVS author(s) to reply :)<br />

<div class="posttext">I thought I'd be helpful and post a link that answered my question: http://www.angelcode.com/source/ <br />
<br />
The Overlay Demo on that page was perfect. My attempts were only a little off :)<br />

<div class="posttext">GREAT! I love it when new people to these forums ask their questions politely, and keep clear what it exactly is they want. Keep it up (y) :D</div></div><hr />
