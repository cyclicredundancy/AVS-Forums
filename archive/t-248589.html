			<strong>Help in finding an old preset...</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi guys :)<br />
<br />
I remember an old preset that I really loved, which I would like to find again but I can't remember the name of it or the author.  It came out, I think, with the first version of Winamp to have AVS (or at least the first version I knew of that had it). I'll try to describe it.<br />
<br />
It looked like driving through a strange city at night, with a starry sky overhead.  It almost looked like an alien city on another planet.<br />
<br />
I searched through the plugins and didn't see anything that reminded me of it, so I thought I would ask here.  Maybe everybody else knows it but me ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Miriya

		I've seen Tokyo Bullet and it is very cool, but that's not the one I mean.  The one I am looking for does not seem to come bundled with winamp any more...probably it is too old for that.<br />
<br />
It was a pretty simple plugin compared to what they're doing now but it was very cool.  I miss it.

		I tried the ones you listed, but it wasn't there.  It might have been by Justin.  It looked kinda similar to others of his.

		Try finding a really older version of winamp. Back in the days it would come with a different set of presets, made by people long time ago. Though I can't recall such a preset in there.

		Yes, I am pretty sure it came with the older version of winamp that we used...I don't remember exactly which one, but it was around 1998 when we had it.  Any ideas where I can find older winamp versions?  So far I have not been successful...
