<div class="posttext">I don't know much about your earlier work, but this one is kinda repetative and basic, so therefor I'd advise you to start doing your own coding, start with finding out what the builtin things do and start experimenting with it. That way you can really do stuff that you intend to do.<br />
<br />
and please, don't start postpumping. We don't like that and if you are going to postpump we start flaming and no-one is feeling all happy :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">He wasn't really postpumping, he was just mad that no-one replied to his posts (I've been there before ;))<br />
<br />
This is pretty repetitive and boring, the colors are all right but the rest isn't much.  Work on broadening the image, make it do more interesting stuff.</div></div><hr />
