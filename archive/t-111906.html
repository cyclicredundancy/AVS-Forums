<br />
1: Help opens in the browser window closest to the top (BIG no no)<br />
2: Edit console not nearly as user friendly as AVS's<br />
3: Control console &quot;&quot;<br />
4: Default presets are even more boring than AVS's<br />
5: Mocha:AVS::MacOS:Windows, in that Mocha may be better but AVS is still more widely used/developed for (so developers will get better criticism and 'mere mortals' will get a bigger variety of presets).<br />
6: There's no 'hard' render (this pixel = this color, instead of this pixel = the color of that pixel over there plus a little bit of the color of this pixel here...) that I can find.<br />
7: Is it just me, or is this thing hella slow, considering how little code it is processing?<br />
<br />
The list goes on.  There's no worth in going to that site guys, it's a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looked at it a while ago. Not my cup of tea. Look through supplied benes though. You may see a name that's familiar. He could give a better review.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Mocha is three years old or something and it ruled back then. Now AVS is a lot better :). /me did a lot of mocha presets :)<br />
<br />
Mocha had a lot of things that AVS doesn't even have, partially because the guy who developed it usually implemented suggestions pretty fast:<br />
- Native Hue/Sat/Lum support<br />
- Bitshifting operators<br />
- Syntax highlighting<br />
<br />
Plus it has the ability to auto-remix presets (mutations). Though this can produce some really neat results, it also resulted in some totally unskilled people getting their 'Ã¼ber-leet' presets published, even though all they did was let it mutate until it looked cool.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's more, but I can't remember out of the top of my head. Just because something is not AVS, it can still be good Atero :P. Just like Geiss isn't spectacular today, or Chtuga.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Didn't say it sux because it's not AVS.  I said it's not very useful in the long run because it's not very useful in the long run - like macs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally i think it sounds interesting although i haven't checked it out... yet :)<br />
<br />
Can someone give links to mocha sites? (like where to publish presets)<br />
Im at school and my time is limited, also im a bit lazy to find out myself :D (please don't hate me! *runs for cover from the flying knifes*)<br />
<br />
But plugins like Acidspunk (the only one i have actually checked out besides avs, if we don't count women that jump up&amp;down in tight shirts) that are totally un-cus-to-mi-ze-ble (phuck, is it how you spell it?) are a big no no :down: Sure you can get incredible framerates, but they get old really fast /me thinks.<br />
<br />
Long Live AVS!<br />
<br />
uhm... was this just slightly off topic? :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, mocha sounds interesting and i want to check it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I ment any other site than that ;) <br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">Tuggummi: If acidspunk and AVS are the only cusomizable plugins you have seen (I know this may get me beat up or somthing around here) but Milkdrop is another plugin you can code presets for. <br />
<br />
www.milkdrop.co.uk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">nixa</div><div class="date small text-muted">1st November 2002, 23:25</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Tuggummi: Isnt acidpunk a preset you did? You are talking like it was another visual plugin.<br />
Mocha presets look ok and Milkdrop is cool but ill stick whith AVS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">WhiteCap allowed you to do presets as well... there are some very cool effects in there :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I remember whitecap, that was neat-o.<br />
<br />
Isn't there some kind of whitecap APE or SVP or something? I seem to remember seeing it somewhere.</div></div><hr />

MOcha is awful.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well both AVS and Milkdrop whoop Mocha's ass, but nevertheless it was a neat plug-in :).<br />
<br />
In fact, a Mocha-ape (i.e. per-pixel formula) would be really cool for AVS. Perhaps with a variable grid size so that it renders at half/quarter/etc resolution for speedup reasons.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">nixa, no Acidspunk is a plugin for wa2 i believe it is still in the most downloaded list at classic.winamp.com and you can't customize it like avs, only choose a resolution or something like that (hey it was a long time ago i checked it...) And the preset was &quot;Techno Punk&quot; and yes i kind of got the name from acidspunk :p<br />
<br />
And i don't think i will ever test milkdrop with the computer i have...</div></div><hr />
