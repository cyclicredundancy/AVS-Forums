		create a new folder, copy your favourite presets and give them a running number as a prefix like:<br />
<br />
01_blabla.avs<br />
02_blablblub.avs<br />
03_whatever.avs<br />
... (hope you can continue yourself)<br />
<br />
using the keys u (forward) and y (backward) you can navigate through your list. Also in &quot;settings / presets&amp;hotkeys&quot; you can tell avs to only use your playlist-folder for random/cycle.<br />
<br />
that's what i would do.

yea, about that, I notice that using y/u takes a lot more time for the preset to load than when I select a preset by right-clicking and select the next preset.. anybody got an idea what causes that?

I would speculate that it is because it has to perform a transition, when you right-click to a preset it doesnt.

		sounds logical, but why is it still slower when you disable &quot;transition on next/previous&quot;?

		because it's still pre-initialising? maybe if you disable pre-init on next/prev.

		I have heeded the STFF(Search the F***ing Forums) imperative for this capability for several days with no joy.  Seeing how the flamethrowers can come out, I was afraid to stick my head up.  I'm glad MaTTFURY did it and got burned to a cinder, so I didn't have to.  <br />

See... he does serve a purpose :)

		Matt, you did many different things also because you, and because those too were you banned. reviving old threads is only annoying and thus can get you flamed.
