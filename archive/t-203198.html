      <p class="post-content">create a new folder, copy your favourite presets and give them a running number as a prefix like:<br />
      <br />
      01_blabla.avs<br />
      02_blablblub.avs<br />
      03_whatever.avs<br />
      ... (hope you can continue yourself)<br />
      <br />
      using the keys u (forward) and y (backward) you can navigate through your list. Also in "settings / presets&amp;hotkeys" you can tell avs to only use your playlist-folder for random/cycle.<br />
      <br />
      that's what i would do.</p>

      </blockquote>yea, about that, I notice that using y/u takes a lot more time for the preset to load than when I select a preset by right-clicking and select the next preset.. anybody got an idea what causes that?

      </blockquote>I would speculate that it is because it has to perform a transition, when you right-click to a preset it doesnt.

      <p class="post-content">sounds logical, but why is it still slower when you disable "transition on next/previous"?</p>

      <p class="post-content">because it's still pre-initialising? maybe if you disable pre-init on next/prev.</p>
