      Hi.<br />
      i was wondering if it could be possible to have the visualizations fullscreen, always on top, half transparent, but non clickable.<br />
      <br />
      i got the idea when i was new to winamp3 and checked the visualizations, i stretched it to fullscreen and made it about 20% visible and it loocked really good, but ofcourse i couldent do anything else then watch since i couldnt click behind it.:weird:<br />
      <br />
      i think this would be a very cool feature, if it is even possible...<br />
      Hoping for good response :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">No, it's not possible. You can set AVS to set your desktop to the AVS screen though, for a similar effect. I don't know if it will have any transparency(I have Win ME), but you may like it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah...transparency like this will just slow AVS down further, and might only be available for Win2K and up (I'm not fully familiar with any of the Windows' past 98 SE, since everything after it has been crap)</p>

      For those of you who really like to cite single examples of how incredibly uber a given program is, remember this: It never works like that in the rest of the universe. When it does, it will be incredibly uber. But seeing as how it doesn't...it isn't.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I've found XP to be a helluva lot more stable than Win 98. Less unexplained crashes, the ability to shut down program threads, reserved kernal space.<br />

      2003 Server is supposed to be nice. I have a friend beta testing it. If you want, the testing is supposed to open until the end of January</p>

      <p class="post-content">chriscooper61, you better watch what you say or you will be getting banned. You have already been warned by Rovastar and I can tell you that the moderators will not take lightly to you flaming like this. Personally, I agree with Atero that Windows 98 is a great OS although I like XP slightly more. Of your two posts that you have made so far you have said nothing of any value and have dissed Atero twice. Yes, Atero will get mad at people who don't follow the rules. I'm sure he will be getting mad at you. He is a good contributer to the forums and makes good comments where they are deserved.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Win98 is NOT a great OS. It has crappy memory management (fixed amount of UI resources regardless of total memory size), crappy task management, no decent unicode support, etc...etc..<br />

      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; Anubis, ever heard of "don't get mad, get even"? Tho' it's gonna be pretty hard...that was pretty 1337..."penis"...wow... &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: The fact remains that Win98 is better than any of the other Windows OS's thus far...it's not like XP is any better, with it's horrid interface, and buggy programming...I think I'll stick to my stable, efficient Win98, thankyouverymuch :)

      <p class="post-content">I didn't think you would get mad because he called you a penis, but because he hasn't followed forum rules(flaming) and is saying pointless crap in his posts. That at least is why I am mad at him.</p>
