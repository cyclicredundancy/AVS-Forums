      <p class="post-content"><strong>Blur preset calculation?</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      I was wondering how the blur preset function works? Is it using a Gaussian filter, and if so, why not approximate the Gaussian using a combination of Box filters? Box filters have a run time of O(height) instead of O(width*height) and a heavy blur filter would have the same run time as a light blur filter.</p>

      <p class="post-content">No - It just takes a portion of the original pixel and 4 more portions for the pixels directly touching it for the whole screen.<br />
      If you want Gaussian, get convolution filter (search for it or get it over at <a href="http://visualization.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://visualization.deviantart.com</a> and to AVS APE.<br />
      As for box filters... I have no knowledge in programming, so I'll leave that for the coding junkies.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT : To think about it, I have a very strong feeling that you're wrong...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah...I realized that the run time was off about 5 minutes after I posted that message. I believe that the real run time is constant per pixel no matter what sigma is used for the filter. With a Gaussian blur, the run time per pixel is dependent on sigma. If I understand Nic01 right, the preset blur uses a convolution of:<br />
      <br />
      [0 i 0<br />
      i j i<br />
      0 i 0]<br />
      <br />
      where the i and j are differnt for each level of blur. If this was the case, then using box filters would be about the same run time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">For as far as I am concerned, It just takes every pixel, compares it with the ones around it, and smudges colors out according to the level of blurring that is set.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heavy blur uses something like<br />
      00i00<br />
      00000<br />
      i0j0i<br />
      00000<br />
      00i00<br />
      which is why it looks kinda grainy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I put a thread about this, you might find it by searching. The ones atero posted are the intended ones, but due to dividing-before-adding, precision is lost and a different result occurs.</p>

      <p class="post-content">as they are now, all of the blur are almost exactly the same in fps cost.<br />
      <br />
      Tho heavy is by far the most efficient.<br />
      <br />
      and there is no gaussianness.. its all just omni stuff..</p>
