      <p class="post-content"><strong>screen size issues</strong><br />
      I'm fairly new to the AVS thing. Typically, I keep the AVS window aprox. 256X256 (for viewing and developing). What I want to do is make a preset that's going to look good even if I switch to fullscreen mode. So far, even if I make a really good looking preset, it usually doesn't look so hot in fullscreen mode. I've attached a sample of an AVS in developent right now (no optimization or whatnot yet), that illustrates this problem (though i've already made it look a lot better than it did at first). Any tips?<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and what window sizes do you guys use? What fullscreen setting? I just want to know so I can know what to design for.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nobody in their right mind uses avs in fullscreen mode, except for VJs and people who don't particularly care about music visualisation or anything like that that is integral to avs.<br />
      it's a slow bitch, so just get used to having to use it at a small windowsize. i keep mine at 320x240 or 400x300, depending on what kind of speed i'm looking for. i usually get stuff at around 20-30 fps, and no matter how small your window is, it's still gonna be as slow.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I keep mine at 280x280 and i get 20-40 fps and the faster (intentionally made simple) ones run around 60fps.<br />
      <br />
      But atero is right, fullscreen &amp; avs just don't mix. Why? The simple ones that could run at decent framerates are too simple and aren't justified when there is already so many plugins that do the same simple things much much faster. And the cool ones, well they can't just pull it... they are too slow.<br />
      <br />
      And no there ain't any solution to it, and no avs can never support your gfx card And no... well just forget it :p<br />
      <br />
      As for problems that are related to the screen size itself (not speed issues) there are solutions that correct aspect ratio, make the components look the "same size" in all resolutions etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not many presets will look so hot in fullscreen mode unless you run it at 800x600, but then you have to suffer at &gt;5 frames per second. When I do view a preset at fullscreen, I use the lowest res available (320 x 200 32 bpp 85 % render).</p>

      <p class="post-content">presets slow down your comps all that much? i usually create and watch em as big as my desktop-WA(in winshade mode)and -system tray<br />
      oh and i move the side over a little for space to reselect the editor<br />
