<br />
<div class="posttext">Intriguing.<br />
I've always wanted to a compilation.<br />
I've got tons of presets that i can dig around in and find something nice. lots of my good remixes the like.<br />
<br />
and what Yath said seems to sound familiar to me.<br />
right now i remember.<br />
your doing the exact same thing i did almost 2yrs ago.<br />
first thing you should never do is demand or require someone to do it. second don't say someone can be noobish but you have to validate their work in order to get it in the pack. that can cause many social issues i won't get into. *remembers the incident with The Earthquakers Winter sports preset* i dissed earth quakers preset under the assumptions i gained from the others and ended up losing the only entrant to one of my contests. <br />
<br />
i hope you don't do the same.<br />
<br />
and a suggested move to make is to post your own work so we can judge it for you. hmm how would that feel it would feel nice would it. so plz take out that thing about the noob presets its just rude.<br />
<br />
i hope to do work with you soon.<br />
<br />
sorry i'm just bored.<br />
Killed 3 mins of my lifeless time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">With such a long deadline I /might/ be able to contribute...<br />
<br />
Exclusive to visbot and deviantart only though? Thats the kind of pretentious stupidity I would expect from a noob... reducing exposure when you want everyone to see your work? I don't think I have to explain why that is wrong... do I? <br />
<br />
Also, when did you become the boss of visbot?<br />
<br />
I agree with the others though... post something and try not to sound like you expect others to do you all the work for you. It won't happen. If you do want this to happen, have an installer and 10 presets ready at least...<br />
<br />
Wouldn't WFC 6 be better?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">lol jheriko think about it.<br />
theres a new aniversary version of winamp and theres no new compilations to celebrate it.<br />
theres the community picks and of course the winamp 5 picks but when was a compilation last done for the install of winamp. i think this whole thing is a great idea and it gives winamp staff sometime to think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I didn't see anything about this either... according to the pack terms, it wouldn't even appear on winamp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">-_-'<br />
<br />
i only said the install thing as a suggestion.<br />
cause one things for sure this would never happen. now the pack it would happen but the install nope.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well... how about someone starts another WFC thread? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">now that i'm all up for. i nominate Jheriko as leader of the compilation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Worst choice ever. If enough people want it I would do it though... be prepared for some seriously draconian criteria on whats allowed in. :)<br />
<br />
Here are some of my ideas:<br />
<br />
 You must solve at least one mathematical problem with the preset.<br />
 You must include at least one superscope or DM containing more than 4 lines of code.<br />
 If you write an APE especially for this you get total control over the deadline.<br />
 At least one 3D model preset must be included. Dynamic lighting is not a choice, its a rule.<br />
 Less remixes. (seriously, thats the only serious idea here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd January 2008, 13:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i retract my previous statement.<br />
<br />
i nominate uhhh GrandChild yeah.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Too late now. I am going to get this one rolling...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">crap &gt;_&lt;!!!!!! can you remove the dynamic lighting thing and make it culling. i suck at lighting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">interesting pack idea jheriko<br />
<br />
i had just poped by to say  &quot;Hey go ahead and use anything ive posted here for the pack, anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
unfourtunately most of my presets fall just short on the new criteria.<br />
<br />
Oh well, you can still use anything i post on the forum if you like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are you looking for original work or a compilation of all the great presents of the AVS world? I have at least 33 major packs that I have gone though and deleted everything except the outstanding. Each pak averges around 25 presets. should I post this?</div></div><hr />
