      this is a new avs project which i want EVERYBODY involved the goal for this project is to let people in the avs-making world know that avs is not dead and the only way is to have the best avs preset pack in the world now in order to do this there are a few requirements that must be followed<br />
      <br />
      1.you are allowed to make as many good or high quality avs presets as possible however if u wish to make nwebie presets for this pacvk i'll have to look at them first<br />
      <br />
      2.there is a 1.6 year time frame for this pack<br />
      <br />
      3.if needed i will include avs presets from my avs collection<br />
      <br />
      4.the maximum amount of presets will be about 500 or so<br />
      <br />
      5.people from the winamp forums and <a href="http://www.visbot.net" target="_blank">www.visbot.net</a> are welcome as are people from other groups<br />
      <br />
      6.if more time is needed for this pack then thats ok<br />
      <br />
      7.email this to your friends and family if they have winamp<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hmm</strong><br />
      Intriguing.<br />
      I've always wanted to a compilation.<br />
      I've got tons of presets that i can dig around in and find something nice. lots of my good remixes the like.<br />
      <br />
      and what Yath said seems to sound familiar to me.<br />
      right now i remember.<br />
      your doing the exact same thing i did almost 2yrs ago.<br />
      first thing you should never do is demand or require someone to do it. second don't say someone can be noobish but you have to validate their work in order to get it in the pack. that can cause many social issues i won't get into. *remembers the incident with The Earthquakers Winter sports preset* i dissed earth quakers preset under the assumptions i gained from the others and ended up losing the only entrant to one of my contests.<br />
      <br />
      i hope you don't do the same.<br />
      <br />
      and a suggested move to make is to post your own work so we can judge it for you. hmm how would that feel it would feel nice would it. so plz take out that thing about the noob presets its just rude.<br />
      <br />
      i hope to do work with you soon.<br />
      <br />
      sorry i'm just bored.<br />
      Killed 3 mins of my lifeless time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">With such a long deadline I /might/ be able to contribute...<br />
      <br />
      Exclusive to visbot and deviantart only though? Thats the kind of pretentious stupidity I would expect from a noob... reducing exposure when you want everyone to see your work? I don't think I have to explain why that is wrong... do I?<br />
      <br />
      Also, when did you become the boss of visbot?<br />
      <br />
      I agree with the others though... post something and try not to sound like you expect others to do you all the work for you. It won't happen. If you do want this to happen, have an installer and 10 presets ready at least...<br />
      <br />
      Wouldn't WFC 6 be better?</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol jheriko think about it.<br />
      theres a new aniversary version of winamp and theres no new compilations to celebrate it.<br />
      theres the community picks and of course the winamp 5 picks but when was a compilation last done for the install of winamp. i think this whole thing is a great idea and it gives winamp staff sometime to think about it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Worst choice ever. If enough people want it I would do it though... be prepared for some seriously draconian criteria on whats allowed in. :)<br />
      <br />
      Here are some of my ideas:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You must solve at least one mathematical problem with the preset.</li>

        <li>You must include at least one superscope or DM containing more than 4 lines of code.</li>

        <li>If you write an APE especially for this you get total control over the deadline.</li>

        <li>At least one 3D model preset must be included. Dynamic lighting is not a choice, its a rule.</li>

        <li>Less remixes. (seriously, thats the only serious idea here)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="post-content">interesting pack idea jheriko<br />
      <br />
      i had just poped by to say "Hey go ahead and use anything ive posted here for the pack, anything you want."<br />
      <br />
      unfourtunately most of my presets fall just short on the new criteria.<br />
      <br />
      Oh well, you can still use anything i post on the forum if you like it.</p>
