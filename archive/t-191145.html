      <p class="post-content">Nice for a first try.. Keep on trying out components and see what everything does. Also, try looking into coded components and try if you can see what everything means, (var is just an example, you'd better not use 'var' as a variable; 'b' is a preserved variable that contains 1 if a beat is detected and 0 if not.) as for today you cannot work around coded presets anymore.<br />
      Get a tutorial somewhere if you can.<br />
      <br />
      Also, bear in mind that you want to keep your presets to run as fast as possible, so try keeping out unused stuff out of your presets as it only slows things down.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I don't know if you selected an .AVI-file, but you have to add that into you zipfile as it won't be included into your .AVS file. This goes for Texer-images too</p>

      <p class="post-content">heh thanks.... but like i said in the begining, i didnt know what i was doing.<br />
      <br />
      as for the cpu usage, there were improvements that i tried to make. i discontinued some of the stuff to, like there was this one that made the whole viz. move and it would change the colors more ripidly (i guess... i dont remember...) but there is alot of things that i have removed from the begining since it hogged all of my cpu usage. it was a pain.:eek:<br />
      <br />
      although the whole project took me only one hour of thinking:hang: . but thanks to the dude (Brennan), i made into something that i liked and kept.:weird:<br />
      <br />
      until then, i think my cousin will still doze off into this avs. lol. :cool:</p>
