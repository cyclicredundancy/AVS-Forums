      <p class="post-content">Nah the name isn't explained. Just kinda likes the little population of lights living on their own world. Lots of crap in the comments though. Thanks for the comment :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice :D Don't like how it's centered tho, needs to move. I tried to do a remix w/movement but I can't figure out the code. Wtf's with your torus code? I don't understand it at all....</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      I've got a lot of changes to make in the code... I hate when I realize I've made stupid mistakes...<br />
      <br />
      Ok fixed some crappy bugs. Should it move on all axes or just the z-axis?</p>

      <p class="post-content">really neat looking... but!<br />
      optimize your shading code, we got function invsqrt() now ;)<br />
      and divisions are just dead slow</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe you could have another version with hundreds of the texerIIs moving around the torus at different rates and slightly "random" moments.</p>

      <p class="post-content">They're completely random. They take random values on the scope so all you have to do to add more of them is x2 it. I'm working on the optimization now.<br />
      <br />
      You think the lights should disappear with backface culling? Or should you always see them?</p>

      <p class="post-content">What I was referring to was the fact that you have to calculate all your normals, but now that I think about it I'm guessing that's for shading purposes :)</p>
