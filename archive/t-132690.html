<div class="posttext">Well it looks like mr. Ozgur has something against me for downgrading my work without giving me a real reason for so. I understand if people are pissed off by me not letting use my pictures, but cut&amp;paste my own copyright msg is just lame. I quote:<br />

ozgur ZEYHAN gave it 0 stars<br />
DO NOT use... posted on April 21, 2003 @ 20:36 PM  <br />
&quot;Pictures used made by Jukka Keskinarkaus (aka Tuggummi) The use of bitmaps i have made is strictly forbidden. DO NOT use my pictures for your own presets! And that includes ALL bitmaps, you aren't allowed even to use the Texer bitmaps i have made!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why im so pissed about this? Gee, well maybe that's because i worked my ass off to get that pack done and when people downgrade it just because they hate me pisses me off :mad:<br />
<br />
ATLEAST GIVE ME A REAL REASON WHY IT SUCKS!<br />
<br />
I have stated the reasons why i don't want my pictures to be used in this thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=131418)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">who really gives what little reviewers who don't even know you have to say, u clearly stated that they weren't yours and that they were made for those presets</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well i do kinda care if the rating drops from 4,5 to 4 for no good reason. Half a star does matter as UnConeD stated in the pickin Dim 3 matter a while back ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not sure where to report them, the mods delete them occasionally but inconsistently. The 'neonazi viruswriter' comments on one of my packs is still there as well... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Reviewers have no access to remove comments from the database at the minute, well, never have , admin used to do it if we had enuff comments to remove by one person, but it's a real time consuming task and they have bigger and more important things to deal with right now, including a furbarred DB for one thing.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, if the new site design ever get's signed off we can start to do something about it. <br />
<br />
Until then, your gonna have to live with it I'm afraid to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, i understand.<br />
<br />
And i do hope the main reviewer/reviewers (i.e. Rovastar) gain a bit more access, so they can help the staff in these kind of small matters :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I used to complain constantly for over 3-4 months because a serial downrater downrated my 3rd pack, and every other pack that was on the 1st-4th page, and nothing happened.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Phaze, he is an AVS artist too. I don't follow his work, but i think he has released more than 8 packs probably both in classic.winamp.com and winamp.com.</div></div><hr />
