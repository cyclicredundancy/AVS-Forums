      <p class="post-content"><strong>Where do i report downgrading comments?</strong><br />
      Well it looks like mr. Ozgur has something against me for downgrading my work without giving me a real reason for so. I understand if people are pissed off by me not letting use my pictures, but cut&amp;paste my own copyright msg is just lame. I quote:<br />
      <br /></p>

        DO NOT use... posted on April 21, 2003 @ 20:36 PM<br />
        "Pictures used made by Jukka Keskinarkaus (aka Tuggummi) The use of bitmaps i have made is strictly forbidden. DO NOT use my pictures for your own presets! And that includes ALL bitmaps, you aren't allowed even to use the Texer bitmaps i have made!"

    Why im so pissed about this? Gee, well maybe that's because i worked my ass off to get that pack done and when people downgrade it just because they hate me pisses me off :mad:<br />
    <br />

    [edit]I have stated the reasons why i don't want my pictures to be used <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=131418" target="_blank">in this thread</a>[/edit]<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well i do kinda care if the rating drops from 4,5 to 4 for no good reason. Half a star does matter as UnConeD stated in the pickin Dim 3 matter a while back ago.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Reviewers have no access to remove comments from the database at the minute, well, never have , admin used to do it if we had enuff comments to remove by one person, but it's a real time consuming task and they have bigger and more important things to deal with right now, including a furbarred DB for one thing.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully, if the new site design ever get's signed off we can start to do something about it.<br />
      <br />
      Until then, your gonna have to live with it I'm afraid to say.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, i understand.<br />
      <br />
      And i do hope the main reviewer/reviewers (i.e. Rovastar) gain a bit more access, so they can help the staff in these kind of small matters :)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the info.</p>
