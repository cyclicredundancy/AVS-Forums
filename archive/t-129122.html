<div class="posttext">hi there everyone,<br />
have used winamp AVS at a few parties and what i normally do is create a folder of all the cool presets i've d/loaded, fire up the line in plug, set on random transistion every 45 secs and leave it to go. <br />
<br />
there are quite a few (about 60ish) presets in my 'party preset' directory. problem is, i always see the same 10-15 presets playing during the party. it gets a wee bit boring. i've d/loaded one or two utils which claim to manage AVS presets but theyre pretty useless IMHO. <br />
<br />
so what i'm asking is does anyone know how to sort out the randomness problem in AVS or can anyone please suggest a decent AVS playlist manager that i can leave on auto for a couple of hours. cheers.<br />
<br />
oh ja totally forgot to mention - i'm running ver 2.7.:up:</div></div><hr />

maybe there will be some improvements</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ah, just got my hands on an app called 'hotlist' which seems to sort things out... fantastic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes, I was about to tell tell you about that one.  I know someone who uses it, and says that it works well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i have this problem quite a bit - it's something more like 50 or so out of several hundred for me.  i believe the reason for this is that random numbers are actually quite biased.  mind you i'm not totally sure on any of this, so don't flame me if i've got anything wrong...<br />
the random function takes a number from the system clock, at a certain depth - this number is always between 0 and 2^n-1.  any numbers above the requested amount (say 50 - this means that it takes a number between 0 and 64) get &quot;wrapped&quot;; that is, 54 becomes 4, 62 becomes 12, etc.<br />
now, this shouldn't stop avs from picking even larger numbers, however i'm pretty sure this can be blamed on the random function in avs.  you're gonna have to wait for avs 2.6+ :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A similar thing happens with the playlists.  I know wa3 allows you to change it so that it doesn't happen.  I don't think that it works for avs though.</div></div><hr />
