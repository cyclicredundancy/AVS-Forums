<div class="posttext">I was a bit frightend to revive this old thread (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=115737), because there already was 2 resurrections made to it and UnConeD bitched both times ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, my problem is as follows:<br />
Before the &amp; operator was fixed, i made a bunch of presets that used that operator with some cool (although random) results. Now that i look back into the presets, they don't work because of the fixed operator :cry:<br />
<br />
Now i need something that i can replace the fixed &amp; operator with that does the same thing the broken &amp; operator did.<br />
<br />
Don't bother posting loads of mathematical explanations, just gimme something i can use straight in AVS.<br />
<br />
Im also pretty sure there's lots of other people who would find use for this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">try floor() or ceil() they work in some cases (if you used &amp; to make stuff into integers). but i dont think there is anything that does the same dogdy function as the old &amp;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nothing specific, i was just looking for a quick fix for this, most of the code is something along the lines x=x&amp;sin(x)&amp;y&amp;y&amp;y&amp;y and other n00b shit like that. But i guess i have to fix my presets the &quot;hard way&quot; :hang:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">btw, i did a lot of stuff like that in the 'Mechanical Curvature' series of presets in my packs... they all seem to work fine here. :P<br />
<br />
just tweak the existing &amp;s and you may well get a comparable result.. although since i dont know what you are using it for its hard to give specifics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought you were talking about boolean operations. I never get what the little help box means about the operators. Does convert values to interger mean ceil or somethings? Besides, by my understanding of things, | is completely useless, it would give the same as &amp;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th November 2005, 18:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">here is how it works:<br />
<br />
the idea of a boolean values is that they are true or false, this lines up with a lot of avs functionality where 0 is false and non zero is true. e.g. below(a,b) returns 1 if a&lt;b and 0 otherwise. <br />
<br />
using 0 as false and non-zero as true, operators like band(a,b) and bor(a,b) do 'boolean and' and 'boolean or' operations, i.e. if a and b are true then return true for band, otherwise false and if a or b or both are true then return true for bor, otherwise false. these are boolean operators since they take boolean values as their parameters and produce a boolean result.<br />
<br />
what &amp; and | do is different but related. internally avs stores stuff as floating point numbers. even integers are stored as floats. a &amp; b rounds the two operands a and b and converts them from float to integer representation (proably using floor, maybe doing a proper rounding) it then goes along each bit and does band to produce the resulting bit in the output:<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
62&amp;96 = ?<br />
<br />
<br />
62:   00111110<br />
96:   01100000 <br />
and:  00100000 = 32<br />
<br />
<br />
each bit is compared to produce a bit in the result, so above only where two 1s line up is there a 1 in the output. | works the same way except that it does a boolean or operation, e.g.:<br />
<br />
33|98 = ?<br />
<br />
<br />
33:   00100001<br />
98:   01100010 <br />
or:   01100011 = 99<br />
<br />
<br />
its not exactly useful in avs though. most commonly i use these operators in programming languages to implement 'bit-flags', where you can use an integer like a small array of boolean values by using | and &amp; to see which bits are turned on or off in the binary representation.<br />
<br />
hope this helps clear it up a bit</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">and integer means &quot;whole number&quot; [can you say that in english?] or &quot;number without stuff behind the comma&quot; :)<br />
[just for clarity I don't think Jheriko pointed that out]<br />
maybe one says integer in everyday english for that, so this post might be useless, but hey...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">For the record, I've used &amp; several times in my presets. I've used | less often, but I've still used it. There are some pretty cool effects possible that require this kind of binary math.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure about what method these use to convert fractional values to integers, though. I would think, though, that they'd either use floor(n) or a rounding function roughly equivalent to floor(n+0.5). It sounds like the latter could be close to what the broken &amp; may have done.</div></div><hr />

.. you will never know :P<br />

<br />
Nah, basically they didnt do the logic operations correctly and just did something similar to rounding the numbers.</div></div><hr />
