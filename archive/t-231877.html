      <p class="post-content"><strong>Boolean Operators I need to break them.</strong><br />
      I was a bit frightend to revive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=115737" target="_blank">this old thread</a>, because there already was 2 resurrections made to it and UnConeD bitched both times ;)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, my problem is as follows:<br />
      Before the &amp; operator was fixed, i made a bunch of presets that used that operator with some cool (although random) results. Now that i look back into the presets, they don't work because of the fixed operator :cry:<br />
      <br />
      Now i need something that i can replace the fixed &amp; operator with that does the same thing the broken &amp; operator did.<br />
      <br />
      Don't bother posting loads of mathematical explanations, just gimme something i can use straight in AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Im also pretty sure there's lots of other people who would find use for this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">try floor() or ceil() they work in some cases (if you used &amp; to make stuff into integers). but i dont think there is anything that does the same dogdy function as the old &amp;</p>

      <br />
      just tweak the existing &amp;s and you may well get a comparable result.. although since i dont know what you are using it for its hard to give specifics.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I thought you were talking about boolean operat<i>ions</i>. I never get what the little help box means about the operators. Does convert values to interger mean ceil or somethings? Besides, by my understanding of things, | is completely useless, it would give the same as &amp;...</p>

      <p class="post-content">here is how it works:<br />
      <br />
      the idea of a boolean values is that they are true or false, this lines up with a lot of avs functionality where 0 is false and non zero is true. e.g. below(a,b) returns 1 if a&lt;b and 0 otherwise.<br />
      <br />
      using 0 as false and non-zero as true, operators like band(a,b) and bor(a,b) do 'boolean and' and 'boolean or' operations, i.e. if a and b are true then return true for band, otherwise false and if a or b or both are true then return true for bor, otherwise false. these are boolean operators since they take boolean values as their parameters and produce a boolean result.<br />
      <br />
      what &amp; and | do is different but related. internally avs stores stuff as floating point numbers. even integers are stored as floats. a &amp; b rounds the two operands a and b and converts them from float to integer representation (proably using floor, maybe doing a proper rounding) it then goes along each bit and does band to produce the resulting bit in the output:<br />
      <br />
      e.g.<br />
      62&amp;96 = ?<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br /><br />62:   00111110<br />96:   01100000 <br />and:  00100000 = 32<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      each bit is compared to produce a bit in the result, so above only where two 1s line up is there a 1 in the output. | works the same way except that it does a boolean or operation, e.g.:<br />
      <br />
      33|98 = ?<br />
      <pre>
<code><br /><br />33:   00100001<br />98:   01100010 <br />or:   01100011 = 99<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      its not exactly useful in avs though. most commonly i use these operators in programming languages to implement 'bit-flags', where you can use an integer like a small array of boolean values by using | and &amp; to see which bits are turned on or off in the binary representation.<br />
      <br />
      hope this helps clear it up a bit

      <p class="post-content">and integer means "whole number" [can you say that in english?] or "number without stuff behind the comma" :)<br />
      [just for clarity I don't think Jheriko pointed that out]<br />
      maybe one says integer in everyday english for that, so this post might be useless, but hey...</p>

      <p class="post-content">For the record, I've used &amp; several times in my presets. I've used | less often, but I've still used it. There are some pretty cool effects possible that require this kind of binary math.<br />
      <br />
      I'm unsure about what method these use to convert fractional values to integers, though. I would think, though, that they'd either use floor(n) or a rounding function roughly equivalent to floor(n+0.5). It sounds like the latter could be close to what the broken &amp; may have done.</p>

      Nah, basically they didnt do the logic operations correctly and just did something similar to rounding the numbers.
