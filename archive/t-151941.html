<div class="posttext">Hi I have made a bunch of remixes from other peoples presets.  My question is do I need to get permission from everyone who's stuff I used before I can release these.  The thing is these are not just minor changes, in every case I have mixed at least 3 presets together and radicaly changed each of those presets, so the end results are extremely different then the individual presets I started with.<br />
<br />
Of course I plan to give all of the original AVSers credit in the readme and in comments as well as list which presets went into which remixes.  But there is like more than 20 people I would need to get premission from if I need to get permission from them all.  I have often seen remixes that were only minor alterations, and that I am sure no permission was given for, that have been up on the main winamp site.<br />
<br />
Finaly, I really want to release these only because they are SICK!! I gaze in fear and awe at the deeply twisted things I have aranged in these remixes.  Oh man...:igor:  I can not begin to describe what I have done and I can only say that there is no way I could have made the presets I started with so I am deeply gratefull for the wonderful work that so many have done.  That said, I have rearanged these presets in ways that I think may surprise and amaze you.  I don't even want credit for these at all really, I just think it would be a shame not to share them. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't know any people around here who will bother if you publish remixes of his/hers work as long as you leave some credit that the original is made by him/her. Come on, show us your good work :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">As long as you give credit where credit is due, you're all clear :) Asking the permission &amp; informing somebody that you have mixed them is of course considered as polite, but not so many people require that as long as the credit message is included within the preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">cool - I just wanted to make sure before I got carried away here.  I have quite a few that are done but there are a couple that I still need to finish before I release them.  I am pretty busy for the next couple weeks so I only get to work on them a little at a time.  I will try to get them all packaged up and released soon though - maybe a week or two.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys. Oh and Tuggummi, I have used some of your stuff in several of these remixes so I'll take this oportunity to thank you personaly for some brilliant visuals - I love your work.  When I release these I hope you will take a look at them.<br />
<br />
Man I really got sucked into this stuff.  I started messing with the settings in AVS and like 12 hours later, mind realing, vision blurring, I stare in awe at what is going on before my eyes.  Hardly able to believe that this imagery has emerged from what I started with.  That was just the first one and the remixes I have done since then are on a different level so that first one won't even be in the release.  It's CRAZY.  Hats off to you people that make these presets from scratch though, I would not even know where to begin if it weren't for you guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well...first off some of us (including me) prefer that you ask us personally first, and/or post the preset (or tell us what you remixed).  *especially* with someone new to the community.  if it's someone we all know really well (e.g. degnic), we usually let it slide, but since i'm pretty sure nobody knows who you are...:)<br />
basically what i'm asking is, what presets did you remix and whose?<br />
<br />
also, a personal policy of mine, which applies to pretty much everyone else too afaik, is that you:<br />
a) include the original comment<br />
b) don't rename the preset<br />
c) put the author's name in the preset filename<br />
as well as crediting anyone from whom you &quot;borrowed&quot; code :)<br />
<br />
and...post your shizzite f00 :p<br />
<br />
<br />
and...omfg welcome to the avs communityz0r.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and i'm spent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:D Well as far as i am familiar with the community there is no problem if act the way tugs told ya :D You don't have to ask for permissions from everybody :P Just from few &quot;exceptions&quot; as Atero :D As i know the others they don't read much of their mail or messages as long as there is no codename :beer:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">But it's true that you should leave the original comment in it, and preferably the name as well. For example: Tuggummi - Worm o' Rama (CrazyWorld Remix)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">JaY FaTBoY</div><div class="date small text-muted">10th October 2003, 09:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ofcourse the original marks of the preset are always kept.</div></div><hr />
