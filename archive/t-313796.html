      <p class="post-content"><strong>hey guys!</strong><br />
      long time no postie! XD<br />
      <br />
      hey I just wanted to try out something that I'm learning in school (heh, collage!)<br />
      <br />
      obviously in AVS we're limited to a -1 &lt;-&gt; 1 in both x &amp; y fields, but I want to try and make lines that would normally be graphed greater than 1 and get the same result.<br />
      <br />
      I've tweaked out the math (like decreasing x &amp; y by a multiple) with no result.<br />
      <br />
      so, at least my example that I would like to work with is a line using f(x) = x / ( x^2 - x - 2)<br />
      <br />
      which solving for x, you swap "f(x)" as "y", and use "x" (in our case) should be the "i" (drawing the line)<br />
      <br />
      the result should split the line twice with two vertical asymptotes with those being at x= -1 &amp; 2<br />
      <br />
      can anyone translate this into an avs field (between -1 &lt;-&gt; 1)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Should just be a simple case of scaling i as needed.<br />
      <br />
      Try something like:<br />
      <i>Init</i><br />
      n = w;<br />
      <br />
      <i>Frame</i> //This is just code for aspect ratio correct<br />
      asph = if(above(w, h), h / w, 1);<br />
      aspv = if(above(h, w), w / h, 1);<br />
      <br />
      <i>Point</i><br />
      k = (i * 10) - 5;<br />
      x = (k / 5) * asph;<br />
      y = (k / (pow(k, 2) - k - 2)) / aspv;<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      That should do roughly what you're looking for.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Aw! thanks!<br />
      <br />
      man, you have no idea how nice that looks.<br />
      <br />
      so basically if i wanted to edit all of that for different lines, i could only need to replace the code, but keep the 'k' where it is, and substitute (in x &amp; y) for 'k'?<br />
      <br />
      or just keep the function for k and x, but only change the 'y', and instead of said 'x' use 'k'? (then of course divide 'y' by 'k'</p>

      <p class="post-content">K is the position along the line, and X is the scaled position along the line. (So it fits between -1 and 1)<br />
      So as long as you're just effecting Y you only need to edit the Y code, with K replacing X.<br />
      To change what it's calculated between just change the equation for K and tweak what K is divided by for X, so it's zoomed correctly.<br />
      <br />
      Does that make sense?<br />
      <br />
      This does not scale the height of Y though. And the Y axis is the wrong way around I think too.<br />
      To be honest it's not too complex to figure out anyway, it's not really anything AVS specific and where it is you can just turn to the Expression Help.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh whoops the '/ aspv' should be '* aspv' btw. (I should actually test stuff before just writing stuff)<br />

      <p class="post-content">You're correct (tested it).<br />
      if framerate were important, I would use sqr(k) instead of pow(k,2).</p>
