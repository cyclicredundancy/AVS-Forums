<div class="posttext">long time no postie! XD<br />
<br />
hey I just wanted to try out something that I'm learning in school (heh, collage!)<br />
<br />
obviously in AVS we're limited to a -1 &lt;-&gt; 1 in both x &amp; y fields, but I want to try and make lines that would normally be graphed greater than 1 and get the same result.<br />
<br />
I've tweaked out the math (like decreasing x &amp; y by a multiple) with no result.<br />
<br />
so, at least my example that I would like to work with is a line using f(x) = x / ( x^2 - x - 2)<br />
<br />
which solving for x, you swap &quot;f(x)&quot; as &quot;y&quot;, and use &quot;x&quot; (in our case) should be the &quot;i&quot; (drawing the line)<br />
<br />
the result should split the line twice with two vertical asymptotes with those being at x= -1 &amp; 2<br />
<br />
can anyone translate this into an avs field (between -1 &lt;-&gt; 1)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Should just be a simple case of scaling i as needed.<br />
<br />
Try something like:<br />
Init<br />
n = w;<br />
<br />
Frame //This is just code for aspect ratio correct<br />
asph = if(above(w, h), h / w, 1);<br />
aspv = if(above(h, w), w / h, 1);<br />
<br />
Point<br />
k = (i * 10) - 5;<br />
x = (k / 5) * asph;<br />
y = (k / (pow(k, 2) - k - 2)) / aspv;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That should do roughly what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Aw! thanks!<br />
<br />
man, you have no idea how nice that looks.<br />
<br />
so basically if i wanted to edit all of that for different lines, i could only need to replace the code, but keep the 'k' where it is, and substitute (in x &amp; y) for 'k'?<br />
<br />
or just keep the function for k and x, but only change the 'y', and instead of said 'x' use 'k'? (then of course divide 'y' by 'k'</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">K is the position along the line, and X is the scaled position along the line. (So it fits between -1 and 1)<br />
So as long as you're just effecting Y you only need to edit the Y code, with K replacing X.<br />
To change what it's calculated between just change the equation for K and tweak what K is divided by for X, so it's zoomed correctly.<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?<br />
<br />
This does not scale the height of Y though. And the Y axis is the wrong way around I think too.<br />
To be honest it's not too complex to figure out anyway, it's not really anything AVS specific and where it is you can just turn to the Expression Help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh whoops the '/ aspv' should be '* aspv' btw. (I should actually test stuff before just writing stuff)<br />
<br />
(Someone shout at me if I'm wrong!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You're correct (tested it).<br />
if framerate were important, I would use sqr(k) instead of pow(k,2).</div></div><hr />
