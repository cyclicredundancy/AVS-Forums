			<strong>Newbie Picture II Question</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi this is my first post so i want to say hi to everyone. i did alot of downloading, way too impressed to not get into this myself! I know how to use openGL pretty well (i did a 3d city for a school assignment) but AVS seems totally different. i hope my knowledge can be transfered over :-) <br />
<br />
Anyways, im just experimenting with different precoded effects and so im using Picture II and I have a set of images that i want to change with the tempo. I tried doing x2 on Picture II with other images but they are simulatenously on screen. How do i &quot;turn off&quot; one picture and then turn on another? I think i want to do a trans fade to black between each new picture. Thanks for any help in advance.

		If it's only two pictures then you could use a buffer save &amp; a alpha blending dynamic movement...<br />
<br />
The effect tree would look like:<br />
<br />
Render / Picture II (picture1)<br />
Buffer Save (save buffer 1)<br />
Render / Picture II (picture2)<br />
Trans / Dynamic Movement<br />
<br />
<br />
Now select Buffer 1 as the source of the dynamice movement, then check &quot;No movement, only blending&quot;.<br />
<br />
add the code:<br />
<pre><code><br />
t=t+0.05 ;<br />
a=sin(t)+0.5<br />
</code></pre><br />
to the frame section of the dynamic movement<br />
<br />
and put:<br />
<pre><code><br />
alpha=a<br />
</code></pre><br />
<br />
into the pixel section of the dm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here i'll attach the preset for you. Just put two picture's into the picture Render II's.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw. Using multiple images would require some more work, but im a bit lazy now, and im pretty sure someone can do it better than me :)

		Erm...not really.  I saw a really good starship effect created with Render/Picture a while back...can't remember what it was, but it was REALLY well done.  It didn't turn or anything, but god did it look better than any SSC I've ever seen...

		Yes, but if someone could make a starship SSC as good, then it would be even better since it could turn and would better react to music.  I consider reactivity a bit more important than looks once you get to a certain point.

This is totally non-related to the topic, but Avatar is also a Hindi word which means physical forms. In Hindu mythology, the god vishnu took many 'human avatars' and come to earth from the land of the gods :)

			<strong>Solution Available</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		psyduck2: Here's the solution if you want to fade in-out of three pictures:<br />
I am bored to explain but here's the avs file.<br />
Just add your pictures in the three effect lists.<br />
Make sure the 'speed' constant is same in all the three dm's<br />

		Anubis: My point was you COULDN'T.  SSC only does so much.  It doesn't have anti-aliasing, and it's damn near impossible to draw something &quot;perfectly.&quot;  Think back to the days of Mario Kart 64.  They used pictures instead of wireframes for the characters because it was so much easier to make it look good.  You can't do that in AVS, but you can't make SSC's look as good as pictures, either.  The effect created in that starship preset was a view from the back, which was perfect for that preset.<br />
You've got a real problem with &quot;if it's easy to use it's LAME&quot;, Anubis...I get the feeling that if there was a fire in your hotel and you were in the lobby, you'd get up to the top floor and take the fire escape there, just to prove that you're better than everybody else.

		Atero i really dont get that analogy, i personally agree with both of you. It would look good and better than any scope blah blah but i still wouldnt give as much respect out to it if it was made out of a picture. I mean i hate using pictures, tho only pictures in the 15 releasable presets ive made are 1 for texer and that picture of homer i used for my donuts preset. Please lets not start an argument over this though, either you use pictures in a preset or you dont, theres no point bickering over why ones better than the other. Its the preset that matters not the picture.

		Atero, if it can be done in a SSC and look reasonably well <b>and</b> be music reactive then I would use a SSC.  Sometimes it is pointless to use a SSC and a picture will suffice.  I don't care which way is easier/harder - I just want the best results.  I love music reactivity(hence my love for avs) and would rather have this than perfect graphics.  For example, I would rather have Raz change his homer simpson picture to a SSC so that homer can move after the donuts, but in a preset such as UnConeD's Wolfenstein preset it would be pointless to make the walls with SSC's when the picture works perfectly and doesn't need to react.

			<strong>Pictures in ssc</strong><br />
		
		

		I think making complex ictures in ssc's is almost imposiible. you will have to use n=w*h to make a fullscreen picture using ssc's.<br />
the other soultion is to use a dm to move the icture loaded. it will be slow but you cant sit and code colours in ssc's to that extent!

		If the entire picture is needed then I say use the picture, but if you can break it down into just a few necessary parts that can be done decently with SSC's then I would use SSC's to do it.

		Pictures? No Pictures?? Whats th point of this discussion?<br />
If you're making an SSC moving and looking good it's :up: <br />
<br />
But why shouldnt a Picture combined with a good DM as look as  an SSC?<br />
<br />
I'm using Picures as well as AVI's and combining AVI's, SSC's and DM's can look really great! (would post an example but it would be 3 Megs large)

		Well i don't mind if Picture II doesn't support any other than bmp, you know a zip packed bmp is almost the same size as a zip packed jpg :igor:<br />

But i love the bilinear filtering in it! It just makes it worth using pictures in the first place.

		I didn't read the release notes - I never do unless I have troubles, and since I haven't used your APE much (and when I do it's with .bmp's cos I'm to lazy to get jpegs) I haven't had time to develop such problems.  Besides, I distinctly remember you telling me you'd gotten .gif and .jpg support in #finnish-flash....
