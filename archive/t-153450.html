      Doesn't work in Windows 2000 "<br />

      <br />
      Thank you for your fault report Brian G,<br />
      If you had read the documentation that came with the iJenAPE you would have found that it only runs on Windows XP.<br />
      <br />
      We are currently working on our documentation / decriptions and websites to make it much clearer that our system only runs on Windows XP and requires a webcam that is capible of supporting a RGB format.<br />
      <br />
      We are sorry that our systems do not work with Windows 98 or 2000, and never will :(<br />
      <br />
      Regards<br />
      SYFi</p>

      <p class="post-content">Why wouldn't it work on Win2K? The difference between the two is negligable. What freaky coding did you do to pull that off?<br />
      <br />
      If you go for Unicode, Win9x/ME non-compatibility is understandable, but 2K?</p>

      <p class="post-content">a) It's an APE, so it has to conform to the restrictions set by the APE sdk. AVS is a non-Unicode app, so I'm pretty sure that's not the problem.<br />
      <br />
      b) It's a friggin webcam APE. Both Video for Windows and DirectShow are available from Win98.<br />
      <br />
      c) It's a friggin webcam APE. It doesn't need to log-in to .NET or anything. Besides, last time I checked, .NET was available for 2K.<br />
      <br />
      Sounds more like crappy coding to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It works over here, sometimes it does crash, but crashes happen rather rarely.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe its because i use Win-ME and crappy ape's go well with crappy OS :p</p>
