		I'm wonding why my trench gets shalower the closer it is to the camera. Anyone got any ideas?<br />
<br />
Or am I going about this absolutely wrong?

		it does it when you set the xa value to pi divide by something, the divide dosent just slant the textures veiw, it slants the movement on the trench downward asit goes out instead of keeping it in a straight line. Ill take a closer look and see if i can fix it.

		The problem is that you still think of DM's in SSC terms. At point (x,y), you're defining the texture at THAT point, nowhere else.<br />
<br />
So offsetting the intersection x,y,z coordinates simply doesn't work because you can only move the point along the ray it's being traced on.<br />
<br />
I suggest you raytrace a half cylinder and a plane for this.<br />
<br />
Oh and you should get rid of the jumpy camera rotations and replace them with something smooth.

		Nice movement.Add ti=10 to onbeat to make it a bit more dynamic.Needs to be smoothen out a bit.

		I haven't gotten the hang of the whole ray-tracing thing. I'm thinking of the DM as a flat mesh that I can deform. I know, I should read that thread where you described it all to nixa. (link <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=115329" target="_blank">here</a> for anyone that missed it)<br />
<br />
Was just messing with the movement. :)

		I can't change the shape or anything, but I think it would be better if it were faster. I changed the first code in the frame box to a=a+0.3, which makes the camera zoom down the trench instead of just kind of sitting there.
