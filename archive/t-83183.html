<div class="posttext">Do you actually know what you're talking about, or did you just think of some words that sounded cool? They sound like Sonique visuals-terms to me. In that case, none of your suggestions make sense, because AVS is substantially different from Sonique's system, not to mention more advanced.<br />
Try suggesting this again when you can explain what you're talking about... sorry, but your current post is simply useless.<br />
<br />
Oh and don't type in 'ALL UPPERCASE', it's considered to be shouting and rude. You would've known this if you'd bothered to read the forum guidelines before posting here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Animation Smoothness - Complex use of DM and Buffer safe can accomplish this rather easily.<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
Well, be smart and figure it out yourself.<br />
(Hint : Use PerFrame part, If command, Above command, and another variable. AlphaBlending, too)<br />
<br />
Animation Speed : Framerate? I thought telling people how to get overlay is already kinda annoying... Follow the ways to do overlay. In the way, you'll encounter how the heck to do this.<br />
<br />
Reverse : Dunno...<br />
<br />
Zoom : Remember your old pal Roto Blitter and Blitter Feedback? Using movement or DM can also give you the effect.<br />
<br />
Smoke : Dunno... But UnConeD's &quot;Comatose Enlightment&quot; gives about the same effect.<br />
<br />
Effects Level : What do you mean? If it's what I think it is, use the Adjustable Blend output of a effect list.<br />
<br />
Zoom Speed : See Zoom.<br />
<br />
I think that gives you a rather nice feedback... though not in a nice manner (sorry) :( <br />
<br />
(Reason : getting kinda hectic of those Caps in the Most Recent Plugins... it's a plague!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Umm...Those effects are directly from Sonique:<br />
<br />
Zoom: Zooms every frame in<br />
Zoom Speed: The distance that each frame is zoomed (drawbar)<br />
Reverse: Zooms out instead of in<br />
Smoke: This is essentially the same as y=y*1.01<br />
Effects level: I believe that this defines how slow each frame is faded (drawbar)<br />
Animation smoothness: The amount that each variable changes in the animation between menus and in the visuals.<br />
Animation speed: The number of frames between menus.<br />
<br />
Although Sonique's visuals can be a shitload better than regular AVS presets, hose functions don't make them any better or worse.  That and the zoom effects, smoke, and effects level can be soft-coded, animation speed is essentially already available, and animation smootheness can't feasibly be transferred to AVS - and if it were, it wouldn't really make sense, as to change the smootheness, you would have to calculate the frames in-between; why not just render them??</div></div><hr />
