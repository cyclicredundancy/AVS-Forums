		MMX is a set of funtion on intel proicessors, designed to speedup certain sound and graphics applications. It's not something you can download.<br />
<br />
If you could tell us what happens when you try to run a plugin perhaps we may be able to help.

		AVS 2.5 (what comes with the current winamp) requires MMX to run however older version of AVS don't not require MMX. (I will try and hunt down exact details for you later and post back (ummh note to self: add this topic to AVS FAQ)<br />
<br />
If you are seeing that message then obviously you have an old PC pre-Pentium II.<br />
<br />
More later. Tired now......

		OK download a non-MMX version of AVS here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.blorp.com/~peter/oldshit/AVS_v2.7.4_noMMX.exe" target="_blank">Nullsoft AVS, old version from Winamp v2.74 (works without MMX)</a> <br />
<br />
Be warned with a machine as old as your AVS will be running pretty slow...:( :down:

		Ummh. I cannot remember if there was anything different about the MMX technology pre Pentium II I pretty sure the Pentium Pros did not have it and they had speed of up to 200Mhz.<br />
<br />
What does TestCpu think you have got?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://testcpu.webz*****" target="_blank">http://testcpu.webz*****</a><br />
<br />
If you have full MMX then I do not knwo but it is likely that AVS doesn't like what you have.<br />
<br />
Did you try the link above?<br />
<br />
You will at least get most of AVS then.:)

		Umm I don't know.<br />
<br />
All I can suggest at the moment is that you try the old version of AVS.<br />
<br />
DO this happens with the old version of AVS too?!?<br />
<br />
ANd with no error message.<br />
<br />
:(<br />
<br />
Otherwise all I can suggest if you want visuals to look at is downlaod Geiss (<a href="http://www.geisswerks.com" target="_blank">www.geisswerks.com</a>) or G-FOrce (<a href="http://www.55ware.com" target="_blank">www.55ware.com</a>) or Acidspunk (...err see winamp site) they should all run ok on your system.

		Sorry don't know what to suggest. :(<br />
<br />
All I can think is deleting winamp and start again as the AVS config file might be all screwed up.<br />
<br />
Try that but otherwise I don't know.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else help?<br />
<br />
Taishaku would just love to be able to see UnConeD's Nuclear Warfare (Ultra High Quality) on his machine. :);):p<br />

Oh BTW you may not know that the latest Geiss v4.24c is out on <a href="http://www.geisswerks.com" target="_blank">www.geisswerks.com</a> it is only a month or so old with a couple o tweaks.

		Maybe the version of Winamp. I and a few others had problems with Winamp 2.8 (there's a thread about it somewhere in the main AVS forum). When I went back to 2.78c it worked fine.<br />
<br />
P.S. Damn you and your accelerated graphics. :(

		Don't install the new Winamp. AVS hasn't changed, it's the same as 2.78, but something in winamp has and it affects AVS in a bad way.
