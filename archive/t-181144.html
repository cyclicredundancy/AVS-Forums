      <p class="post-content"><strong>Song title, artist always shown in visualizations...</strong><br />
      Hello and thanks for the great WA5 and visualizations!!<br />
      <br />
      Just wondering if it would be interesting to have an option in AVS to always show Song title/Artist etc.<br />
      .. something like in milkdrop!<br />
      Better than having to press "t" to have it appear a few secs...<br />
      Advanced options could include location (bottom of screen is better than middle, expecially when in fullscreen with the black stripes for 16:9 look), font, etc...<br />
      <br />
      thanks!!!<br />
      <br />
      Stefano</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you like that sort of thing... i guess it would be nice, i personally don't want to see anything but the preset :p<br />
      Though there is a way of doing this manually, you can add a Render / Text to the preset if you like, but that's a lot of manual labor if you have a lot of favorite preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeap add it manually on every preset.. i would get crazy ;) Easier to have it as an option in WA5.04 ;)<br />
      <br />
      i like to have the title shown when i launch a huge randomized playlist with loads of new tracks...</p>
