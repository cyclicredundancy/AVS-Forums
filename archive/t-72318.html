      A minor update to the original. I tinkered with the dynamic movement to give the carpet more of a free-floating feel. Please download this one instead of the other one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i thought it was good but some things were bad first of all the framerate and the problem when the carpet hit the top or bottom but still a real good preset. one suggestion is to loose the 1st effect list and put a fade after the second effect list and more tip<br />
      <br />
      in the second effectlist you have first a effect list in an another effectlist remove it from the effect list and put it in the root and you increase speed (see drawing)<br />
      <br />
      + effect list &lt;--- list-root<br />
      + effect list<br />
      + effect list &lt;--- pull this out to the "list-root"<br />
      trans / bump<br />
      trans / dynamic movement<br />
      trans / dynamic movement</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry if you don't get a good framerate Montana. :( I designed it on a Pentium 4 1.5gHz and I get about 22 fps fullscreen at 800x600x32. If you have a slower computer, you are just out of luck. Any screen resolution below 640x480x32 produces serious problems in fullscreen mode (namely the problems that you listed). My suggestion is to run it in a window and try and get the best setup possible. If you have WindowsXP remember the alpha blending trick.<br />
      <br />
      You are right about the whole effect list thing though. I used to have it set up with maximum blend on the nested list and then a fadeout set 80% above it. That changed before I released it but I never fixed the effect list. Thanks for catching that. :)<br />
      <br />
      As for the second idea about loosing the first effect list... buy a better computer and it will run just fine. :D If you have trouble with both effect lists running, just turn off the first.</p>
