<div class="posttext">Hello there Math-bunnies (joke from S.A):<br />
I have spent the hole night :weird: trying to understand some things in Dynamic movements, but... im still confused and out of choice!<br />
I was wondering, what in the holly creepy squared world! means:<br />
DYNAMIC MOVEMENTS?!:eek: :igor:<br />
<br />
Anyway, i saw in a bulletin that there are 2 groups of coordenates, or wharever you call 'em .<br />
I call the first group: &quot;the chubby group&quot;, that includes:<br />
 R<br />
 D<br />
 ---basically---<br />
<br />
The NERD group includes:<br />
 X<br />
 Y<br />
 Z<br />
<br />
Is that right?<br />
 Well, i've been using these coordenates but i want MORE action, so... i was wondering AGAIN:<br />
<br />
 WHAT IN THE HOLLY CREEPY SQUARED WORLD ARE T,I,U,ETC?!<br />
<br />
PLEASE!<br />
IF SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN ME EVERY OF THE COORDENATES THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH, IN DYNAMIC MOVEMENTS, WITH DIAGRAMS OR SOMETHING EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ILL BE VERY VERY HAPPY AND CALM FOR A WHILE!<br />
<br />
ALSO THE MOVES YOU CAN APPLY THEM!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks-------------------------------&gt; :-D:p :cry: :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1) DON'T USE CAPS!!!<br />
<br />
2) Search the forum, im suprised that you didn't find an assload of topics about dynamic movements when you searched for them (i assume you searched, because you mentioned another thread)<br />
<br />
3) Read the FAQ! It's right there in the AVS &quot;general discussion&quot;...<br />
<br />
4) Z is a user made variable, usually used to descibe depth or z-axis rotation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Google (http://www.google.com) for:<br />
- cartesian coordinates (x,y)<br />
- polar coordinates (d,r) (more commonly known as (r,theta))<br />
<br />
There's tons of stuff to find if you just look around. Come back when you have a question slightly more specific than &quot;tell me everything you know about DM's&quot;.<br />
<br />
Actually I'd just typed an explanation of what a DM does (and what makes it so different from a trans/movement) until I realised I have typed this several times before.<br />
<br />
Do some forum searching, you're bound to find one of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks guys, i searched google. was  very good resource for my doubts-<br />
actually im trying to understand this kind of maths, im kind of too young for understanding, i think, lol<br />
anyway, thanks a lot, if you know if someone has some information about movements like RAND and COS (COS&amp;ACOS) ill thank a lot if you make me know where can i read them,<br />
bye</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Two rules about this forum:  Don't make unnecessary posts, and DON'T make unnecessary personal attacks at newbies.  Personally I think another post like that deserves about a week ban...anyone else? :mad:</div></div><hr />

No, we don't need to start anything resembling a flame war.  Instead of doing this though, I will yell at you about double posting.  Use the &quot;edit&quot; button instead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Rand is a function that returns a random number.<br />
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, and atan are all trigonometric functions. You should be able to find stuff on them in any text that has has a geometry section.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Urgh, i got this book (a very2 old book, well i think it is because it has this sort of 'ancient' look on it) that explains everything about polar coordinates, cartesian coordinates, trigonometric, and so much more, and do trust me, it was a mind crushing to understand. <br />
<br />
Anyway, apart from that ancient book, i have a teacher that is seriously into this 3d thingy u know, and i think he's a fucking genius cause he helped me a lot with 3d movements and all. But, unfortunately, he will not join avs community, for reasons that i still couldn't understand (who wants to hear that crap huh max?) okay okay, enuf babbling (or whatever) <br />
<br />
Search the internet for it, and may u'll find them =D</div></div><hr />
