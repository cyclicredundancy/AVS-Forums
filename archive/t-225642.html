<div class="posttext">I've had these presets unfinished in my &quot;laboratory&quot; folder for quite some time and i can't think of any way to make them worthwhile your time. I do like holographic noise though, but it's nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
Why post them then, you ask?<br />
Because im a assnugget, i say.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">just some quick suggestions.<br />
<br />
another phucking skull: i don't think there's anything new you can do with the skull thing.<br />
holographic noise: that's really nice, just try to get rid of those edges and that should be enough.<br />
particles gone wild: try to make them do something else, the movement is kinda boring after some time. for the background i'd use a gradient or something very simple, but that's me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">In holographic noise, those edges are 100% intentional, in fact i think i spent about 3 hours to make them like so :p<br />
<br />
(just had to point out)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:( With a name like that, I was hoping for this:<br />

<br />
Not too bad after all though. I like the refined particles, but even though there is no trans/water, which you did a good job replicating, I think it could use some fadeout, because the &quot;water&quot; is a bit too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Quite cool Stevenroy, The water-like effect looks pretty good, colors aren't exactly my taste, but they aren't too harsh for the eyes either.<br />
<br />
One thing i can't understand is that why you took off the particle resizing and color code? Atleast you could've kept some basic particle resizing where you adjust the particle size according to the resolution. Now the particles will most likely be too big for small windows and too small for big windows.<br />
<br />
But anyway, if you can use these presets as a base for something good, then by all means do so :p</div></div><hr />
