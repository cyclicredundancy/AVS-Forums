		Try disabling Aero when Winamp is running, I believe they should work then. (I haven't personally tested)

Aero disabling didn`t helps. When entering fullscreen mode (without overlay) screen splashes several times from avs to desktop then stops at desktop. When overlay mode is selected then all fullscreen is darkbrown color only. So that`s a pity...

overlay does not longer work on windows vista, windows 7 and what may follow.<br />
<br />
try resetting all your avs settings, they are stored in your winamp.ini

		AVS just isn't for running on Vista and newer OSes. reverting Winamp versions won't help with that issue as it's the AVS plug-in which is the problem (since it's from the Win9x days) and just needs to be killed / updated / dropped or something but no one cares about it now hence it just getting further broken.<br />

		which has the version of the AVS plug-in (2.83) that everyone complained doesn't work with whatever ape's etc it is and therefore it is broken as is the case for going back to the 2.81d.<br />
<br />
hence my post is correct in that it doesn't matter what version is used, all versions are broken in different ways and that's just not going to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
AVS should not be in the distro as it is clearly not working, cannot be supported (there is no interest to work on the thing either officially or otherwise - chavs had what one part-working release and that's been it) and no one wants to take the source code and fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
additionally telling people to downgrade Winamp when it's just a broken dll is completely irresponsible especially 5.581 as that leaves a user open to the dll loading security vuln (and a number of other ones).<br />

		Thank You guys for helping! I thought too that avs plugin is old for new os. I will use Milkdrop, it works perfect and uses my 3d card))

		Downgrading in never the best option but it is the only way to run avs if that's what you want.<br />
<br />
Without AVS, I'd probably have switched to another player in the 3.x days.<br />
<br />
5.581 with 2.81d works on win7, that's all I'm saying. you can still choose to install the most recent version for your music as a seperate install.

avs supports at least <a href="http://foobar2000.org" target="_blank">foobar2000</a> and <a href="http://support.xmplay.com/" target="_blank">xmplay</a>, though i don't remember if components using bitmaps, like texer, are working properly. they surely don't work on winamp running in wine/darwine.<br />
<br />
if security is an important factor, one can still run an old winamp version in a virtual machine (or <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/" target="_blank">sandboxie</a>), isolated from the actual operating system. take a look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank">windows xp mode</a> of windows 7 pro and ultimate or virtualbox, vmware etc. on fairly modern hardware, the loss of performance is negligible.<br />
<br />
personally i'm running avs on my macbook air through <a href="http://darwine.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">darwine</a>/<a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/" target="_blank">winebottler</a> and the performance is great (faster than on my windows desktop), just that texers don't work.

		/me bangs head on desk.<br />
<br />
there is no need to be downgrading the whole of Winamp just to use the older/newer/whatever vis_avs.dll - can that fud stop being spread as it's just getting as bad as the people who resolutely stay on 2.9x or earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
the easiet option is to remove AVS from the distro and provide it as a separate installer with an option to select what version of the plug-in is wanted but stating clearly that it's broken in certain respects. that way it's down to people to decide if they want to install it or not and then doesn't become a primary support issue.<br />
