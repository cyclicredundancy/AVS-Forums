		PSH, around here, there goes a simple rule: &quot;give credit where credit is due&quot; - If you use something from someone else, name him and the preset it came from in your comment. <br />
<br />
(also, check if they don't forbid to use their stuff at all as some might do)<br />
<br />
further, good stuff. Keep it up!

		But who made the preset which the scope was in? That is who you should ggive credit to.

		let me guess: your scope bases on the superscope example called &quot;exploding daisy&quot;, right? I was wondering all the time where i have seen that code before and accidently i just came to it.<br />
<br />
So, to whom should this credit go? I think no one really knows who made those &quot;built-in&quot; examples that come along with the superscope, movement, dynamic-movement etc.:confused:

		owww. my bad then. Are those builtins still using 3.14159265358979 then? (shorter, I know.. I only know the 14 digit version (really) ) How ancient... that's what we started with indeed, then came pi=acos(-1) and now we have $pi

		it seems as if those &quot;builtins&quot; have been revised since the &quot;old days&quot;, cause they're using $PI now.

		hm i'm wondering. what do you mean mysterious_w? Earlier this thread we found out that the supercopes are taken from the built in examples (when you click the &quot;Load example...&quot; button in the ssc config box). And he didn't use anything else creditable, did he?
