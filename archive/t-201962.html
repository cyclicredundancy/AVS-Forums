      <p class="post-content">PSH, around here, there goes a simple rule: "give credit where credit is due" - If you use something from someone else, name him and the preset it came from in your comment.<br />
      <br />
      (also, check if they don't forbid to use their stuff at all as some might do)<br />
      <br />
      further, good stuff. Keep it up!</p>

      <p class="post-content">let me guess: your scope bases on the superscope example called "exploding daisy", right? I was wondering all the time where i have seen that code before and accidently i just came to it.<br />
      <br />
      So, to whom should this credit go? I think no one really knows who made those "built-in" examples that come along with the superscope, movement, dynamic-movement etc.:confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">owww. my bad then. Are those builtins still using 3.14159265358979 then? (shorter, I know.. I only know the 14 digit version (really) ) How ancient... that's what we started with indeed, then came pi=acos(-1) and now we have $pi</p>

      <p class="post-content">it seems as if those "builtins" have been revised since the "old days", cause they're using $PI now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hm i'm wondering. what do you mean mysterious_w? Earlier this thread we found out that the supercopes are taken from the built in examples (when you click the "Load example..." button in the ssc config box). And he didn't use anything else creditable, did he?</p>
