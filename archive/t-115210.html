      <p class="post-content"><strong>w,h as dm grid size</strong><br />
      It would be usefull if dm grid size could be defined like:<br />
      (w|8) (h|12)<br />
      I think the | sign is called div in programing or is it mod? :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">| is usually the OR command, in AVS it's an integral bitwise OR:<br />
      <br />
      14.3|25.8<br />
      15|26 &lt;-convert to integer<br />
      00001011|0011010 &lt;-convert to binary<br />
      00011011 &lt;-do bitwise OR; if a digit is 1 in either of the numbers, it is 1 in the final number<br />
      27 &lt;-convert back to decimal<br />
      14.3|25.8=27<br />
      <br />
      C++'s TRUE/FALSE OR (||) and AND (&amp;&amp;) go like this:<br />
      <br />
      (a&gt;b||b!=c&amp;&amp;c==a) :: conditional (a is greater than b OR (b is not equal to c AND c is equal to a))<br />
      This returns TRUE if a is greater than b, or if b is not equal to c and c is equal to a.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I don't think we ned to have that capability with DM gridsizes, since you'd get people like me who had never done DM's before using w and h for gridsizes, and getting 0 fps out of it, then coming to the forum complaining about how crappy AVS's Dynamic Movement component is (except I didn't complain about it, since it wasn't crappy, it just didn't have W and H for gridsize.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wrote it wrong. Its (8|w) and (12|h). For any x,y e N and x&gt;y there are such q,r e N that x/y=y*q+r and r&lt;y. Anyway | is a math sigh and that x|y=q.<br />
      I thought it would be usefull for making grid size resolution dependable. I dont really understand yore argument, its the same as someone would say that avs sucks becouse you can sett superscope n to 1000000.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So your 'DIV' or '|' is just integral division? 'MOD' is the modulus operator btw (% in AVS).</p>
