      AVS still doesn't respond on those forms of music. It may be hard to program, but is well worth it - if possible</p>

      <p class="post-content">This has nothing to do with AVS but the respective input plug-ins: they don't supply visualisation data to AVS.<br />
      <br />
      I suggest you read up on the plug-in/components model.</p>

      <p class="post-content">isn't it possible to change it so that avs grabs the master sound output and used that as its source, then it would work for everything regardless as to the input plugin being used.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That would kind of defeat the purpose of the input/output system, plus not every sound card offers this option. I can understand why MIDI has no sound-data (usually it's a hardware synthesizer, or a software emu that looks like hardware), but there's no reason why WAVs don't supply them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">cack i forgot about that, i remember one of my friends had a cack sound card like that and some cd-&gt;wav software i made failed on it because i used the lazy way of doing it (i.e. visual basic).</p>
