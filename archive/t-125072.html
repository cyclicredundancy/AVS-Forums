<div class="posttext">I don't know...<br />
A pack called 'i wanna be frank nagel' was released after he left AVS (i think), so it would be nice to make a tribute pack to UnConed, based on remixes of his presets.  tell me what you think...</div></div><hr />

As he has still not left avs, then maybe he too can contribute :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think we should, cause he is one of my fave AVSers,<br />
<br />
The thing that impressed me most about him was the way that he pushed the limits of AVS, and made things previously thought impsossible, and even when he couldnt bend AVS to his divine will, he could code APEs to aid him, truly an awesome artist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't try even to remix them otherwise, because i think they are perfect and my fiddling would only make them look ugly :p<br />
<br />
But hey, it's a free.... internet, so you can do whatever you want and if others follow then go ahead.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Not that I know everything about codind, I have remixed some of UnconeD's presets already, for e.g milkyway II.<br />
<br />
one easy thing-in mission to mars, just add a blue unique tone after all those mountain ssc's. then you get some other planet effect :).<br />
<br />
I think we should make this remix pack.<br />
<br />
What about starting a company or any thing of that sort, then make presets part by part.<br />
we can vote for the best artist who hasnt retired, then make him director <br />
<br />
:D <br />
and some guy with lot of money as the producer :p <br />
the other artists will do drawing, some will handle camera, etc, etc</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Because that kind of setup is unnecessary.  These forums and deviantArt serve as a great place to collaborate to make presets, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">anubis: I meant to say that we can make presets together, instead of everyone making individual packs.<br />
this would increase the overall quality of the pack.</div></div><hr />

I agree with atero, we should set our minds on other community projects since UnConeD isn't even dead yet (100% dead avster).<br />
<br />
Anyway, carry on.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't I be in charge?  i feel so neglected :cry: <br />
<br />
 if we start now, and we do work in our spare time, then by the time we DO get it done and all the submissions filtered for the absolute best ones, he might have left the forums by then.  This doesn't have to be done, or start for that matter, for a very long time...this doesn't have to be finished soon, even being done in a year would be OK.<br />

i used custom bpm to measure time,<br />

As far as I understood it, this shall be a Tribute to UnConeD's work and not to the fact that he said he's leaving<br />

Has a man to be dead before you can worship his work???<br />

remember to include the original comment too...<br />

anubis- if he DOESN'T come back then YOU will look stupid for not helping.<br />
if he DOES come back, we can drop the work until he DOES leave<br />
<br />
anyways, remeber this is not time-critical.  finish the devart tribute and other community packs firts before starting this<br />
<br />
lol- speaking of UnConed, I hope THESE (http://www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=128310) don't find their way here</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">OK, I'm sorry if this is merely a tribute pack.  I thought it was supposed to be a pack tributed to him because he has left.  Perhaps the discussion of him leaving made it seem like this.  Just try not to make it so you guys will be eating your own words though(i.e. don't say he has left forever or anything like that)).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">is anyone except me is intereseted in making the remixes:confused: <br />
i find that no one is contributing.<br />
anyway, this is the first remix:::<br />
from unconed's first pack.<br />
Clone UnconeD. is this a good name. i dont think so.<br />
this crossed my mind, so I am saying it.<br />
<br />
btw. my first pack is published:<br />

<div class="posttext">i'm working on some, but of course i won't upload.  most people doing this are probably dissecting the code, which will take FOREVER so it looks worthy of UnConeD.<br />
<br />
Clone UnConed is ok, but I still like <br />
'UnCloned (until now)<br />
<br />
btw- read the naming conventions!!!<br />
<br />
$original name- $yourname remix <br />
<br />
so Unconed - wormhole - shreyas_potnis' remix</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Mind the capitalisation :P.<br />
Btw if you're interested, here are some coding 'conventions' I usually use in my scopes and DMs:<br />
<br />
cx,sx,cy,sy,sz,sz: cosine/sine of rx,ry,rz (rotation angles)<br />
cr,cg,cb: red,green,blue color used as the basis for the scope<br />
ip: alternating 1,0 or 1,-1 variable<br />
ox,oy,oz: camera position in a world-fixed 3D SSC or a 3D DM.<br />
ot: usually used to normalize/equalize ox,oy,oz<br />
k, dx, dy, dz (and k2, dx3, ...): used for raytracing a DM<br />
ix,iy,iz: raytracing DM, coordinates of intersection of ray with object<br />
af: aspect-ratio correction multiply factor<br />
sd1, sd2, sd3: random generator registers<br />
t, ti: time and timeshift (onbeat)<br />
<br />
In complicated scopes I sometimes reuse a variable as a temporary variable (not enough variables in AVS) so you'll have to watch out for that. Red,green,blue are often used as temporary vars if they appear near the top of a scope's per-point.<br />
<br />
tpi: 2*pi<br />
u is often a scaled value of i, used for evaluating paths (e.g. rollercoaster, da-traced logo, ...)<br />
th,ph: often used as &quot;theta, phi&quot; for 3D polar coordinates<br />
ph: sometimes used as phase for controlling the camera in a 3D dm. for example in Wolf3D, the camera can be in one of several 'modes' depending on where it is and what it has to do (face corridor, move ahead, stop and rotate, ...). Ph will have the values 1,2,3,4, for each possible phase a value.<br />
bc: sometimes a beatcounter, when it will appear as bc=(bc+1)%8 (or different constant) in onbeat</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Remixing presets is tougher than i thought. <br />
first you have to decode the code. thats the rel difficult part. and as UnconeD's presets are mostly about being technically anvanced, remixing them is kinda head breaking. <br />
still i am making them. but i have to make my new pack as well!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ok, imagine zero g maze 1 transition to zero g maze 2... huge isnt it, and zero g maze 2 just goes in a straight line with intersections after a bit. now imagine what i'd have to do to firstly choose a random path, then go inbetween the bit that takes all the mad insane coding.. a little harder than it first sounded now isn't it. I'm working on the edges on my raytraced perception which is just an intersection maxed out but i'm crap with alpha blending so it may take a while. Might change the texture, might not.</div></div><hr />

I coordiante this project (at least I started it and will upload it)<br />
<br />
This project is to be the community pack next in line after DevArt 3rd birthday is done.  After that, it will get serious (I hope).</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: I just looked at your intro, and if you want my objective opinion on it, it sucks, all you did was blend a ready made preset with a simple text effect and a picture. I would like to think that if this pack ever does progress that the presets it will contain will have more time and thought put into them than that. You have some good coding abilities, I'm sure that you can do much better than that.</div></div><hr />

Well, I know I can do better than that, and the intro preset is merely a format about how the intro should be...like the ones we see in new movies. We can just change the preset or can remix it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I can make the intro, and I will make it really cool, push avs to the limits ;), because this is a tribute to UnconeD, who really did that, just give me the final name of the pack.<br />
<br />
Michealthecat, you are the head, so you can decide.<br />
Here are the names out of which we can select one:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 I wanna be Steven Wittens<br />
 UncloneD<br />
 Clone UnconeD<br />
 Any more suggestions?<br />
[/list=1]</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Personally I don't think that the pack should be called 'I wanna be steven wittens', its like a lame ripping off of the el-vis tribute pack name and I'm sure that a lot of people will see it that way.<br />
<br />
UncloneD sounds like it should be a pack copying UnConeD and Clone UnconeD sounds lame for the same reasons and because it is grammatically inappropriate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You forgot Anubis' suggestion, which is my personal favorite: UnCloneD (until now).<br />
<br />
BUT...the people should decide.<br />
<br />
After this pack is finished (if ever), we will have a nomination/voting thread.<br />
<br />
Jheriko: I never intended this pack to be called 'I Wanna Be Steven Wittens'...I wanted a tribute to UnConeD, and I figured that name would ring a bell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raz: I forgot to thank you for using the correct naming conventions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's okay, but the ssc needs work.  There isn't much brightness or fluent edges to it.  And you could probably change it to a more moving DM (Such as Degnic's &quot;Bubblegum&quot; preset) A watery pulsating movement like that.  I mean, it's a pool, right?  <br />

I like the golden shiny effects though, good job :up:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Shreyas: your dynamic clearing ape is a bit weird... bits of functionality, but nothing really concrete. If you make an APE, you should give the preset author as much functionality, not just a blackbox (I think we stepped away from that a long time ago).<br />
<br />
You could just as well make an optimized APE that does 'd=0' without all the memory reads, and leave the colorcoding to a single dot scope. AFAIK a single dot scope is very fast, and it allows you to code your own expressions rather than relying on your APE.<br />
<br />
When I think about it, it'd just be a simple 'rep stos' asm block inside the APE ;).<br />
<br />
Oh and if you guys are still going to do this pack, I'd really like if the remixes were more than just my 3D DMs with a different texture... but I guess I can't be picky :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, that would be a good idea, so I have to pick the colour from the center of the screen and fill the entire screen with it.<br />
something like <br />
pixel_colour=*(framebuffer+(w*h/2)+w/2);</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">im working on a couple now.. <br />
1: reflecto cube, only with a reflecto sphere and a cube around it instead of vica-verca.<br />
<br />
2: another 3d maze rip, only with a plane in place of an intersection<br />
after a few times through the tunnel thingo, so it looks like you come out of a tunnel, fly around between two planes for a bit, then hop back into the tunnel again.<br />
<br />
neither are very finished, cause i keep working on my own shit, and trying to be steve frickin wittens is so time consuming.<br />
<br />
Btw, doe anyone know a way to use multiple textures in one raytraced dm? ive tried to use different parts of a buffer, like stretch the top left corner of a buffer and wrap that for one object, and then use another part for other objects etc, but its not working very well.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; also, i think that while its important we dont simply spit out cheap re-whackoed presets, i think we should try to maintain a whacko style, rather than do presets of our own style with only a little bit of whacko in them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If the DM is not too complicated, then you can usually get away with two separate DM's that are alphablended with eachother (or additively blended after being DM-alphablended).<br />
<br />
Otherwise you'll have to do what you said, use separate parts of the buffer for separate textures, but then you lose the ability to wrap for example.<br />
I did a cube a while ago with 4 different textures on its sides with the best possible continuity (never released it, it was just a test) and it's not too hard if you keep track of what you're doing (write it out on paper first).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th May 2003, 13:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">What i was trying to do was use logic operators to simulate the wrap function. This is quite hard, cause the avs window is -1&gt;1 instead of 0&gt;1. so when you are dealing with the wrap windows it becomes 1&gt;3, 3&gt;5 etc, which isnt very maths friendly. <br />
<br />
try this in a dm WITHOUT wrap on.<br />
<br />
x1=x*2;<br />
x1w=(x1%1);<br />
x=if(below(x1,-1),x1w,if(above(x1,1),x1w,x1));<br />
y1=y*2;<br />
y1w=(y1%1);<br />
y=if(below(y1,-1),y1w,if(above(y1,1),y1w,y1))<br />
<br />
this is about as far as i ever got on this tangent.. you might be able to break some sort of barrier for me.<br />

btw, sorry all for posting this sort of shit in this thread.<br />

do you think you could post that cube if you still have it.. perhaps this thread is not the best place but.</div></div><hr />

x=(x+100)*1000%2000*.001-1;<br />

Pingpong wrap:<br />
x=asin(sin(x*pi*.5))*2/pi;<br />
y=asin(sin(y*pi*.5))*2/pi;<br />
<br />
As as the multiple-textures-cube goes, it's simple... just restrict each face to a different area. e.g. x=if(equal(k,k1),if(above(ix,0),iy*.5+.5,...))</div></div><hr />

any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I would brighten the splat scope so the ripples are more noticable:<br />
red=cr*dt*4;green=cg*dt*4;blue=cb*dt*4;<br />
<br />
Some minor speed up tips:<br />
- Use powers of two for convolution, especially the divisor. Try this:<br />
[1][2][1]<br />
[2][4][2] / 8<br />
[1][2][1]<br />
Note how the divider is half of what it should be, so it automatically brightens in one step too.<br />
- Use smaller n for the fountains (logical ;))<br />
- Turn off bilinear for the 3D DM<br />
- DM:<br />
 * Remove statement &quot;iy=-oy+dy2*k;&quot; not used<br />
 * Instead of &quot;ix=ix*2;iz=iz*2;x=ix;y=iz;&quot; just put &quot;x=ix*2;y=iz*2;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I really like the multiple fountains... has a sort of ballet-feel to it. Would be cool if you could program some more patterns into it, I wasn't satisfied with that either ;). Here's how they are coded:<br />
<br />
md is the current 'mode' of spraying. It is changed onbeat, and is a number from 0..3. The current patterns are:<br />
- Regular ******d fountain<br />
- ******d fountain with rotational particles<br />
- Bursting fountain<br />
- Unrealistic 'dancing' path<br />
<br />
Per particle the following parameters are calculated off v1,v2,v3, these are the 3 random values that are different for every point.<br />
<br />
yv is the vertical position of the particles. If the mode is 1, then the particles are bursted in one spray, otherwise they spray constantly. This is done through &quot;v1*(1.2-equal(md,1))&quot; (the spread of values is either v1*1.2 or v1*0.2).<br />
However yv is not really the vertical position, it is calculated as &quot;yv*(1-yv)&quot; later in 'py' to get a parabolic falling path. But you don't have to worry about that.<br />
<br />
th is the direction of spraying on the circle (theta), so it is an angle between 0 and 2*pi.<br />
<br />
hf is the ******d motion of the particle. the higher hf, the further from the center it will land<br />
<br />
I suggest you first play with the fountain, and then update the 'splat' scope. The splat scope is a 2D scope that draws the particles only if they are very close to the floor (thus creating a one-time water ripple at the right time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ahh...This really helped. Originally I had planned to make the fountain spray different patterns at the same time. So that each pattern sprays different patterns. But then the 2d 'splat' scope woudnt match with the fountain, so I kept it as it is.<br />
I will see what I can do. But I really liked the camera movements :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah... i havnt actually looked at that preset for a while, but i think i just threw in the effects i needed without even thinking about optimising it. <br />
<br />
If you take out the horizon/sky, it should be uberfast again.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; I had another look, and everything in the first effect list really needs to be cleaned up, ie the superscope has n=200, and it only needs around 20. Take out the color reduction too. Fuckit, you play around with it.. i couldnt be bothered.<br />
<br />

<div class="posttext">another quite heavy remix by me :)<br />
looks like very few people are interested in making this pack. atleast those who have the tech know-how should come forward :hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">very nice.. need ALOT of work though.. <br />
1. its not very reactive at the moment, and is quite slow.<br />
2. the texered lines do not move at the same speed as the 3d dm. <br />
3. Also, texered lines can be very dangerous to begin with, since they appear completely different on different resolutions with/without pixel doubeling.<br />
4. the stencil shapes arnt exactly adding to much to the preset, you could put something better in instead. Plus, they should fade with z coloring.<br />
5. Try to make the ship stand out more, maybe use a different blend mode other than additive.<br />
<br />
the texture youve used is spectacular, and the stars are a nice touch. i miss the electicity from the original version.<br />
:) keep it up.<br />
<br />
il try to get round to finishing off some remixes as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it doesnt matter.. there is no date. this just = a bank for presets to build up in untill we have enough for a pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No i mean one has to decode a preset before remixing it(that's what i cant do:( ), otherwise any silly n00b can add any thing and say its a remix.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm working on quite a few remixes, randomised different types of tunnel for zero g maze 3 right now. Proving to be a right royal pain in the ass. Don't worry if no-one replies for a while. It doesn't mean no ones working on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here's something i managed to do:) I did'nt change anything much just played around with the Dm, it looks kinda like zero-g maze, but its has a dreamy feeling in it.<br />
I added a title to it, remove the last fx list if you dont want it.<br />
but looks nice with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This one is a great preset, but I think the sky is too crowded with stars.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There are a lot of stars in the real sky. :p<br />
<br />
Seriously though, just reduce n in the first superscope (the one with ·Starfield; at the beginning of the init section) until your happy.. but don't publish it with reduced n, I prefer it with that many stars, I changed it up from 200 originally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">heh...<br />
Here i made two new remixes. The other three i made sux. The best is to forget them. theese are much better than the other three.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">lose the buffer save in the mister happy remix.. it draws whatever was in the buffer last onto the preset which means that you can also take everything out of that nested effect list and put it into the one that contained the buffersave<br />
<br />
edit: also there are two custom bpms.. one at the very bottom of the preset which does nothing and the one at the top destroys all on beat reactivity.. although maybe you intended that because without it the preset is pretty jumpy or occasionally draws nothing for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
edit2: you could use one crossbar scope in the tie tunnel remix... its a minor detail of no real importance that doesn't noticably effect the preset: set n to 150 and use u=i*tpi*48;py=cos(u)*.03;pz=sin(u)*.03;px=i*1.2-0.6; for the first line of code on the original crossbar.. you can now remove the other two.</div></div><hr />
