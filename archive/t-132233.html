<div class="posttext">&quot;WHAT MUST I I DO TO MAKE THIS GODDAMN THING WORK???!&quot; implies to me that you were whining.<br />
<br />
DOn't turn this into an argument just let it drop. And be curtious to other members. UnConeD has earned respect. You haven't. He was in the right i simply decided against harassing you since it was your first post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Earning respect has got nothing to do with anything.<br />
Please treat other members in the same way you'd expect them to treat you.<br />
<br />
Everyone's gotta start somewhere, and everyone was a &quot;newbie&quot; once.<br />
Ok, admittedly, Fletchface02 posted in caps, which suggests shouting/anger (see forum announcement (http://forums.winamp.com/announcement.php?s=&amp;forumid=85) thread), but a simple and polite &quot;please don't post all in caps, blah-de-blah, etc&quot; would suffice. There's no need to flame. That is no way to welcome new forum members!<br />
Remember, this is a public forum, open to everyone, not an elitist clique.<br />
<br />
k?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Reading back the respect thing didn't really have anything to do with the post. UnConeD was in the right though which was my point. My first post was respectful. It was when he critisised UnConeD and the forum in which he was asking for help that i became a little less welcoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">DJ Egg</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th April 2003, 17:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">No. UnConeD was NOT in the right! That is exactly my point.<br />
<br />
Yes, your first post was respectful.<br />
And that's as far as it needed to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmmmm...<br />
irony?<br />
<br />
&gt;capital letters imply anger, frustration, emphasis, and loudness but NOT whining<br />
<br />
&gt;well now wasnt doing anything horribly wrong when UnConeD decided to whine(yes i say whine) at me for &quot;whining^&quot; at me for asking for help while expressing the urgency of my problem<br />
<br />
&gt;also id like to compliment you all on your *wonderful hospitality* and i hope a manically depressed person never visits this forum because he/she would probably kill him/herself<br />
<br />
&gt;by the way i can play this game all day:p</div></div><hr />
