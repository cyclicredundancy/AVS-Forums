<div class="posttext">Is it just me seeing certain things (I'm not sure about specifically what) in nested effect lists. Example is my intro to WFC5/&quot;Winamp&quot; preset in my third pack. The nested list seems to overtake the containing list, and then it's completely ignored. And it works when i disable the contained list.<br />
<br />
So has someone been tinkering with the wrong bit again or have i jacked up my install or something? On the off chance that someone who might actually be able to do anything would by some miracle be reading the forum. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Aha! Source Mapped movements seem to be the culprit. No change to the 'shouldn't be' situation, but that's where the problem is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the avs dll hasn't been changed since the 'd' spec revision i last did so i've no idea what would be the cause of that. now makes me not want to do the mini updates i've got to do on avs for something else...<br />

<div class="posttext">I can imagine, AVS's code is probably what Munch's guy was so horrified by. ;)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
By the way, disregard the nested effect list thing. It appears to be just (&quot;just&quot;, like this makes it so much easier) source mapped movements in effect lists.<br />
<br />
edit again:<br />
Okay i'm wrong, it's not as clear cut as that, it's extremely odd. I'll keep experimenting with it, try and nail down exactly where the problem occurs.<br />
<br />
edit the third:<br />
Okay, the circumstance seems to be when there is a source mapped movement in an effect list, with any movement directly before it in the list. Except when there is a source mapped movement anywhere in the list before [the movement just before the problem movement].<br />
<br />
edit^4:<br />
Oh christ, I have circumstances that contradict that, it seems that every time i add more there's a whole extra dimension added to the weirdness.</div></div><hr />
