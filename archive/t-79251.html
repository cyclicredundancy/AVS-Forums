      after apprx. 2 1/2 weeks of waiting, my presets got posted by winamp.<br />
      <br />
      i got some 3d shizzit in there so check that out. 99% of this pack was original, only exceptions being i used a modified version of an elvis SS and a modified version of a DM used in the Galacticon pack. When you look at this pack, note that when i started this pack in december, i had no idea how to use DM's or superscopes, so this whole thing is a learning experiance for me.<br />
      <br />
      haha i got my first downrater! zero out of five stars and a comment reading "bla bla bla bla" haha i asked for it and i got it...<br />
      <br />
      so<br />
      <br />
      everyone who i pissed off in the past year....<br />
      <br />
      down-rate my new presets <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=96541" target="_blank">HERE</a><br />
      <br />
      or just objectively review them, its up to you.<br />
      <br />
      this is my first serious pack of presets i made. and duo is helping me out alot so my next pack will hopefully be alot better than this one... im learning how to do 3d DM's through x, y, and z instead of random equations haha.<br />
      <br />
      and look for AVS-Ike at deviantart.com to see my newest presets and all that. im working on a potentially good one now, ill post something about it here when im done, so look for that.</p>
