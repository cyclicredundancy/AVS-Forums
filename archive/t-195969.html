      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Forum Group at DA?</strong><br />
      After thinking about where Pak-9 should host his dedications pack, I was wondering if we should set up an AVS Forums group at DA. Community packs like the deications one could be hosted there, plus any more competitions we decide to do.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not quite sure how groups at DA work, but I was thinking that the regular posters here like Tuggummi, Pak-9 and wotl would be able to get into it, plus myself, since I thought of the idea.<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, so what do ya think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I always assumed 'groups' were just accounts created by people to represent a grouping of people. But even so its not a bad idea, I just wonder if there is enough material to support such a 'group'</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not saying it would have to be very active, just when one of us actually manages to organize a comp or something we publish it there. Even if it's only one relase a year it would be useful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I tried setting up a group of my own, but I couldn't promise myself and therefor the others that I would be certain to have the time to organize it for the upcoming time. For me, I'm starting a new job next monday (educational) up to halfway January, and I don't know what to expect yet.<br />
      <br />
      So if you would set up such thing (just search around will give you the information needed, or else don't be shy to ask), I'm in, but I'll leave the leading to someone else for at least now..</p>
