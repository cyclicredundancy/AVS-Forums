      <p class="post-content"><strong>Inspiration</strong><br />
      I need ideas of some kind of cool AVS preset, 'cause I have absolutely no Idea of what to do. I need inspiration.<br />
      <br />
      I usually like to make abstractions/real things in my presetes, usually Including something 3D. I DON'T like to make random effects with even more random movements, unless it is actually something good.<br />
      <br />
      Mabey the ideas explained in this forum can help anybody when they are clueless of what to do. This can be a forum for anybody to find ideas.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There are millions of ideas out there, usually I just "invent" a preset whenever I want to test some tech code.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to make some specific shape then you are half way there already, you just need a background (which can be nothing for an appropriate shape). If you want to make something functional then just start with something simple.<br />
      <br />
      For instance, recently I was thinking about making an intro for J10 (again!) my thought process went something like this:<br />
      <br />
      * use dodecahedron<br />
      * make a load of contraints between the points and do some physics... let it fall and roll, maybe a random tug on beat<br />
      * add lighting, maybe a light falling with the dodecahedron, or strip lights in the tunnel (soft projected shadows :D)<br />
      * maybe make it rolling down a tunnel, with projected shadows<br />
      * fancy text with 3d models, make wireframe fade across solid geometry<br />
      <br />
      Now if I wanted to actually make this preset all I would need to work out are the trivial tech details and maybe spend some time making the colours nice and pretty.. all I did was start thinking about what I could do with a dodecahedron. :)<br />
      <br />
      Try doing the same, but just change it a little bit. Or do what I do when I run out of ideas and am desperate to make a preset, follow this plan:<br />
      <br />
      * take sphere superscope and play with parameters and equation<br />
      * take "played with sphere" and place it infront of a generic flow dm<br />
      * tweak<br />
      * add Jheriko super-ugly coloursâ„¢<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      Are you sure it wasn't a rap song?<br />

      I think it's important that you understand the difference.

      <p class="post-content">for me it's usually like this:<br />
      <br />
      I tinker with object A<br />
      I add effects b,c,d and e.<br />
      I tweak it a bit<br />
      I change the colors<br />
      I remove some small annoyances<br />
      I change some more effects and colors<br />
      Only <i>then</i> I find out that I have removed every object I started with and it looks nothing like whatever I had in my mind</p>

      Your delivery reminded me of that classic Family Guy quote:<br />
      <br />
      Peter: "I read a book on that once."<br />
      Brian: "Are you sure it was a book?"<br />
      Brian: "Are you sure it wasn't nothing."<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure it was intentional :p

      <p class="post-content">When it comes to my avsing i do it in this order.<br />
      1 think<br />
      2 think some more<br />
      3 finally start coding and make mistakes as i go along.<br />
      4 post pre-version on forums ie. Nanakiwurkz Mini<br />
      5 make changes suggested<br />
      6 tinker on more useless experimental presets<br />
      7 when done make simple intro with nice effects<br />
      8 post pack and get flamed to death by DD and all other pros on submission.<br />

      J.Melo i think your galaxy is nice. even tho the getosc resize and position thing was already being seen in my Galaxy preset.<br />
      i like your cause your is like a more technical version of mine even thou mine has artistic beauty and pure raw FPS speed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I always think that inspiration actually is a mute point for the most part...<br />
      <br />
      Working and finding something that works and is functional along with creating something original is something based on the observation of the work of others..<br />
      <br />
      Knowing what you want to create is something else..<br />
      <br />
      There are a lot of sources for study but the creation itself of one single thing can come from hundreds of emulations, from which you come up empty handed..Its a lot lot VJ-ing which the point itself is thinking ahead of the music and feeling and recognizing the feel of most of the ambiance created...<br />
      <br />
      So creating an avs that responds well to a dynamic field of frequencies adjusting its speed, rotation, color range and so on..can be cumulative to creating a good visual that can capture the Feelings within the art(music) itself..From deep French lounge to Drum and Bass..to Techno..Breakbeat.. minimal electro...vocal.classical...<br />
      <br />
      next is placing and naming the avs's so that they are presented in a manner which is reminiscent of of a quality professional VJ.. making it flow from one to the next..transitions can partly be responsible..but the actual feel in the difference or likeness that they may share and be able to actually move one to the next easily..This can be for some forms of music while others use contrast..<br />
      <br />
      realizing the weight and feel of the colors versus look at me I am rainbow colored..staying within certain color patterns..certain trends I have noticed that have been gone on by AVS's have also came to light with surprising results..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Thats my take on it anyway..</p>
