1 - Any suggestions as far as system specs to get good framerate in a full screen mode (can it use 3d hardware accel at all?)<br />
<br />
2 - I'm a big fan of the desktop overlay at the moment. My question concerning that is it possible to get rid of the actual avs box so only the desktop overlay is displaying the effects?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Andy</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The answer to question 2 is yes.<br />
<br />
Sort of.<br />
<br />
 You can't actually get rid of the avs window while running it in overlay mode that I know of. However, I am running two graphis cards, which results in two desktops. Whether I'm actually using the second desktop or not I can move the Avs window ont it and thus have only the overlay appearing on the main monitor(while the secondary monitor is actually my Tv..).<br />
<br />
 Another  fullscreen trick: uncheck the &quot;wait for retrace box&quot; instant 15% faster..Also closing any apps tht may be running on the taskbar will help..<br />
<br />
 The max I've seen as far as framerates was 300x400 32bpp fullscreen running about 30-40 fps... this was on an Athlon 1gig.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't know about you guys, but when I run Winamp minimized, the overlay still works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, right just minimize Winamp, the overlay is still running...<br />
When turning off the &quot;wait for retrace&quot; you can get some ugly effects at some framerates of the AVS. If the framerate is high enough, no problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">A sort of trick of what you an do with the window- Drag it (click near the top-left corner) almost into the bottom-right of the screen. It'll still stick out a few pixels, however. Maybe that's obvious as hey-ell, though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There is a way that seems simple enough that I just made up ;)<br />
Try moving the AVS box as close to the &quot;start bar&quot; as possible, when it's down at the bottom it will stop automaticlly. Release the mouse button, then press &amp; drag it once again, even lower.<br />
It will dissapear! :eek:<br />
To get it back, rezise the start bar so you can see the AVS window again, then it will move up by it self. :)<br />
I'm not that sure if this is a bug on my computer, but I don't think it is, as I've done it 3 or 4 times. ;)<br />
