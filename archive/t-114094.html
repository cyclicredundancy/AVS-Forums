		Well, most of you have seen this one(at devart).<br />
<br />
I still didn t make that installer so its not getin realeased yet. (to be honest I just DL this from Devart so none of the typies are fixed (like scupers etc..), sorry for that :( ).<br />
I realy dont know when I'll have time to make the the stupid installer so till then it will just be here:D.

		Amazing effects and great visual styles :). Though now I can't do a smoking-joint preset anymore because you obviously had the same idea...

		The name Pickin dim means:<br />
<br />
Picka is a vulgar expression for a female sex organ :D and <br />
dim  means smoke. If  you put it together you get pussy smoke.<br />
<br />
The expression is used to describe something or someone irrelevant.  It's kinnda international in the Balkan region. I named it that way because no matter how god it is and how much time I invest in it , it's still kindda useles in &quot;REAL LIFE&quot; (whatever that is) :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
Thats it. :D

		I completely agree with that real life thing. For example, my friends didn't believe me that were one of the highest rated on winamp.com . ( My 3rd preset pack was 2nd at one time :) ). And I spent time I should have spent learning doing presets.<br />
<br />
E, da, pack ti je skroz dobar.

		Holy Crap...........these visuals are like &quot;Opposite World For Whacko&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe UnConeD and fsk are gonna get competetive!<br />
<br />
For some reason I don't like that....<br />
<br />
But UnConeD is leaving AVS.....hmm......
