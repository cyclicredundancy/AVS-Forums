<div class="posttext">Hello, My name is BigBob (Bob Perri).  I love making AVS files for my winamp.  But when I realized that there are others who make presets, I was excited.  I was greatly influenced by ELVIS, Unconed, and Artero.  These great Mathematicians helped me tremendously!  I cannot give them enough thanks for their explanations of the Math, the Functions, the Renders... all that stuff.  Thank you men, for what you did.<br />
Remember this is my first real Preset AVS Pack for Winamp. They are pretty neat.  I hope you enjoy looking, mocking, changing them as much as I had making them!  ENJOY...<br />
Oh, the title for this preset is 'SuperScope Annomelies'!  Now enjoy!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow...<br />
<br />
i'm just...<br />
<br />
amazed...<br />
<br />
someone placed me next to unconed...<br />
<br />
thanks :D:D:D:D:D<br />
<br />
out of this pack, the box presets really stood out...but they both need to be more dynamic.  your syncing consists of a static on-beat setting (bad) - use something like:<br />
(getosc(0.47,0,0)*8753%100)/500-0.1<br />
this takes an arbitrary oscilloscope position and permutates it to the point of fair randomness :) if you don't know what any of that means, study up on the modulus operator (%).<br />
<br />
the vecto preset was also very good, but it too needed to be a lot more dynamic.  overall all of your 3d shapes need to be more dynamic - you've got a good handle on modeling them, now you need to polish them off and make them look good :)<br />
<br />
hope i've been a help,<br />

<div class="posttext">I agree with atero on all counts...<br />
Your a long way ahead of the majority of those who come here for the first time.<br />
You definiatly need to learn how to use the dynamic movement. There are explainations of it here on various threads (use the search). <br />
<br />
Other than that, spend some time downloading other peoples packs from the more 'aesthetic' side of town (such as tuggummi, degnic, duo etc.<br />
<br />
If your into the crazy 3d shite, download 'pickin dim' by '~fsk'<br />
<br />
If you spend time on this forums, your avsing will only ever get better. Just be careful of atero; your on his good side now, but it wont last (it never does) <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow, atero's being nice towards a newbie! Incredible! :D<br />
<br />
Tho i can understand why, these are pretty far above from the standard n00b presets, with all that 3D shiznaz and stuff... But i agree with siddharta here, pay more attention to the aesthethics stuff, coding isn't everything.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the forums, nice to see a new guy who actually knows something :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1intro - Dont use lot of text renderer's in one preset, as the size of the text is not proportional to the AVS screen. Small screen users may not see the text properly.<br />
2intro - Found in the comment.<br />

What's this?<br />
3dcircles - I too have the same problem. Cant get proper names for the presets :( Not a very attractive preset though.<br />
3d rotating scopes with dots - Cyan - Spiral graph fun, Red - Spiral, Yellow - vibrating worm, green - vertical bouncing scope, orange - Alternating diagonal scope, blue - 3d scope dish. Am I right?<br />
3d rotating scope - Not much difference.<br />
3d rotating scope - Not very interesting.<br />
Another tunneling thigy - Doesnt look like a tunnel in any way. n00bish.<br />
Box - The colours are good and soo is the on-beat brightening. The best preset till now.<br />
Box2 - I like the first one more. Thebump gives the flow a pseudo 3d effect which spoils the 3d effect of the scopes.<br />
California Sun - Come to India, there's sun everywhere! As hot as being in a furnace.:)<br />
Goldfish Tank - The orange blobs dont look like a goldfish to me, perhaps you could make something more intereseting.<br />
Knocked over hourglass{/B] - Ugly, but allright.<br />
[B]Metropolis - Quite a good preset, but there's a lot of cyan in it, could have used an extra fadeout.<br />
Party Sphere - Very very similar to newpicks - pretty dots.<br />
Rotating pretty thing remix - The bump is static, the color codin static and the preset is not very responsive. At the same time it is not good looking too.<br />
Something - You can make time correct you know...<br />
Sphere - quite an interesting preset. <br />
sphere:<br />
i=i*pi;<br />
x1=sin(i)*sin(i*40)*.3;<br />
y1=cos(i)*.3;<br />
z1=sin(i)*cos(i*40)*.3;<br />
Sphere2 - I guess you got it right :p<br />
Stargate - The backgroung and the ssc colours dont match, thats why the preset doesnt look good.<br />
Surface of the sun - Would be better if the colours remained in the 'sphere' and the stars outside the sphere.<br />
Water fountain - Boring.<br />
The dancing star - Dont like it very much.<br />
Face lift - Looks much more like a face.<br />
Vecto - Add a color-map or something to make it look better. THIS preset doesnt look good in black 'n' white.<br />
<br />
If you are doing AVS for three yrs, then definately this is not upto the mark</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Be VERY careful to give appropriate credit when you use other people's code or general ideas. There are some people on this forum that will get VERY VERY pissed at plagurism.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thank you gentelmen for all your help and support.  I feel honored that you guys took the time to download and observe my presets.  I really apperciate all the help and techniques that you have offered me.  I will improve on my next set!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice work on 3d scoping :), can't really say I was able to pull that of in my first pack :p. I can't even do some of it now, though I'm getting a hang at it. Search the forums for my first pack (author: deamon, pack name: iab avs), for some really simple effects which still come together to a nice preset, you might learn from it (though I think you already know that kinda stuff :p) And for the rest, keep tearing apart all the presets you can get your hands on, it's the best way to learn AVS besides just trying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wow! Thanks Atero for that '(getosc(0.47,0,0)*8753%100)/500-0.1'!  It makes the Box preset so much better!  I have it in Zipped format in case any one wants to see it.  Thank you again, Atero</div></div><hr />
