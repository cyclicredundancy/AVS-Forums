<div class="posttext">I use a program called Fl Studio and I have a M-Audio soundcard. I've found i can use real-time effects by selecting (Analog In 1 Delta...) What would be cool is if I play my drums or guitar or bass or piano or sing, or whatever, if the visual effects would interact real-time with my signal... <br />

<div class="posttext">If you can get Fruity Loops to output to your line out then yes, because you can just hook it to your line in and configure winamp to use it.<br />
<br />
You could also combine your standard stereo output and feed it back to line in but I think that would be too awkward</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only problem with this is that the latency is annoying.<br />
You will always have like 1/4 of a second time difference between input and output. It's almost impossible to sing or to play the guitar while everything you play comes out of your speakers so much later. I've tried some times to play guitar w/ visuals [with Jasper's plugin], it's annoying, I gave up on it. :(<br />
<br />
But try anyway, maybe you'll find a setting that keeps the latency under 5ms [which I found to be the maximum for playing  at the same time] :) If you do tell me!<br />

//edit:<br />
forget what i said...<br />
only the visuals will be a little behind, but that's not a problem I suppose.</div></div><hr />
