<div class="posttext">I'm creating a Mosaic on DeviantArt. The idea is we take screendumps of our best work in AVS, and we create the Mosaic from that. If you're interested (and have a DA account) then sign up here and I'll invite you in.<br />
<br />
C'mon, I reckon we can get something good going here. Everyone's welcome to sign up. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Are any decent looking presets acceptable, or do you prefer something more specific (e.g. technical, pretty, innovative, colourful, etc.)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bah... I reaaaaaaaaaally can't see the point of mosaics that are just a collection of loose images. The whole point is making one seamless artwork, with hours spent on every tile. I've been working on the Pixel City and Pixel City v2 mosaics and they're great. Of course you do have to flame the occasional non-blender who doesn't get it, and the system isn't very suited to isometrics, but it's still very cool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">jim: Nah, anything you want is fine, just as long as it's decent-looking. So what's your DA name?<br />
<br />
UC: Meh. Your loss. :p BTW I've seen your work on the Pixel City. Pretty nice stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My DeviantArt name? I don't actually have one yet. Been planning to sign up for some time now but... you know how it goes. Not enough time and too many opportunities to waste it.<br />
<br />
Btw, is there a deadline on this thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">uNDefineD</div><div class="date small text-muted">4th September 2002, 10:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nope, the only deadline is from when you are given a panel to a certain time after that (in the case of this mosaic, 24 hours). It takes as long as it takes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sign up as soon as you can, then PM me on DA so I can invite you. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Bump<br />
Is this everyone? I can't help but feel a little rejected. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Sorry, man. I've had work like you woouldn't believe lately. Can't say when I'll get on to it.<br />
<br />
Be patient, though. You never know when I quiet thread will just go off. I'm surprised people wanting to promote their packs haven't taken up the offer.<br />
<br />
I'll keep checking back and see if you get more support.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">my deviant account is ~suspectpixel.<br />
<br />
yesterday registered. Still I can't understand what this all gives to me. Maybe you could in 3 sentences define - how deviant art can be good for me?<br />
<br />
[it's not an offence - simply interest]<br />
<br />
You can take a screenshot from my www - that gif in index.htm is AVS too.</div></div><hr />
