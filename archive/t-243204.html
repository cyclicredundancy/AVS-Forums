      <p class="post-content"><strong>Efect lists confuse me</strong><br />
      ive noticed that effct list (dont corect the spelling of it) can make an exeption of a setting<br />
      <br />
      exaple: you want one thing to move but not anther thing:<br />
      <br />
      Stay as it is: Rendrer/ring<br />
      Move this: Rendrer/moving particle<br />
      <br />
      if aplied a movement:<br />
      <br />
      Rendrer/ring<br />
      Rendrer/moving particle<br />
      Trans/movement<br />
      <br />
      the movement aplaies for everything above it, but how do i make the effect list stop the ring from moving in the same settingas the particle?<br />
      <br />
      also more explenation would be nice about the effect lists</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm pretty sure Effect Lists have been explained here several times before. Have you tried the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank">search</a> function?<br />
      <br />
      (I had to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank">search</a> when I was first figuring out effect lists. I found a lot of useful information that way.)<br />
      <br />
      To sum up: An effect list works very much like an independent preset, which can then be placed inside another one.<br />
      <br />
      What you're trying to do can be accomplished with an Effect List. The trick is to have the Effect List selected when adding another effect, and then that effect will go inside the Effect List. Moving existing components into an Effect List is hard unless there's already something there, so sometimes I temporarily add an empty "Misc / Comment" into an Effect List so that I can move existing components above that.<br />
      <br />
      To do what you're trying to do, you can add an Effect List, then move your Render / Moving Particle and Trans / Movement into it. If you want things before the Effect List, like your Render / Ring, to be visible too, then you'll need to change the Effect List's output mode to something other than "Replace". "Additive" and "Maximum" are popular choices for this.<br />
      <br />
      There's probably a lot more you'll need to know before you can make decent presets, but I hope this at least helps you get started.</p>
