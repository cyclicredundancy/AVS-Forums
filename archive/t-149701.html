<div class="posttext">Will &quot;Hotlist&quot; let you keep certain presets on longer than others in automatic mode?<br />
<br />
<br />
Heres what I want to do...<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Preset A will stay on 30 seconds<br />
Preset B will stay on 20 seconds<br />
Preset C will stay on 10 seconds<br />
Preset D will stay on 40 seconds</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I barely used the program, but I don't think it had that option - I may be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Magic.X knows for sure, but I haven't seen him around for quite some time now. Maybe he's on vacation. But if you have the program, why not just click every menu? You'll find out fast enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Wait for Hotlist 2.3 with new blasting customization options! :D<br />
<br />
(I'm back soon)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sounds good thanks and keep up the good work. Will it support 2.7? Does the version even matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th September 2003, 14:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't think there are any major differences in that respect from the different AVS versions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Now we just need something that would give us control over transition variety. I perfer no transition but every once and a while(after 6 presets or so) a slow dissolve would be nice. I don't know if that could go into Hotlist though, could it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">vjdude</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th September 2003, 17:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Is there something like Hotlist that would switch between winamp visualizations? although it's seems like that would be a rough switch(full screen problems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Deamon</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th September 2003, 22:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't recall anything that'll do that. And indeed it will be a damn rough switch, some plugins don't even run fullscreen. So nice-looking is not really in the same box as switching between plugins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Switching between plugins aint possible in a smooth way.<br />
<br />
Hotlist 2.3 is going to support avs2.7 of course. I'll make it work. (@anubis: 2.6 caused troubles too due to the size clipping)<br />
Transition switching is already implemented.<br />
<br />
Some words to the customization<br />
<br />
You may customize your presets by:<br />
-running mode (time; beat; after time but on beat (new mode))<br />
-running time (seconds; beats)<br />
-transition (on; off)<br />
-transition style (you know them for sure)<br />
-transition time (up to 8 seconds in 250 ms steps (so 32 steps at all))<br />
-render old effect (on; off)<br />
<br />
You may customize all values or just several ones (the rest remains a general setting)<br />
<br />
You will be able to override these custom settings with general ones for live playing. Actually, i am messing with the graphical design of the dual / shared controls and unfortunately i'm pretty stuck.<br />
<br />
I'll try to make a running versio which i can post here to collect suggestions ... maybe, if i'll have enough time.</div></div><hr />
