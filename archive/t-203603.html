<div class="posttext">I've been considering which of my collection of naff presets to put up here for a while, but didn't think any of them were good enough.<br />
<br />
However, a few dynamic movements and a couple of colour maps later, and I've actually got a few that look half decent.<br />
<br />
Hope y'all enjoy them. All comments gratefully appriciated, even if you just wasted enough of your valuable time to call me a time-wasting loser ;)<br />

That aside, there's one thing you have to learn about the forums.  don't listen to MaTTFURY. He has a amazing ability to say things that lead to him getting flamed, just loook around theres evidence of it everywhere.<br />
<br />
I would look at your pack, but i'm using a laptop now, so even trying to open avs is asking for trouble.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh, okay. I'll take anything he says with a pinch of salt.<br />
<br />
But dude, I *made* those AVS files on a 466 Celeron laptop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">not bad for a first release.<br />
i like &quot;music fish 2&quot;, it has nice colors.<br />
&quot;cinematropic&quot; is not bad, too. They are both simple but i (personally) like them.<br />
<br />
The others are not quite my taste, have seen this style too often...</div></div><hr />
