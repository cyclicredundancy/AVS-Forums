      I've been considering which of my collection of naff presets to put up here for a while, but didn't think any of them were good enough.<br />
      <br />
      However, a few dynamic movements and a couple of colour maps later, and I've actually got a few that look half decent.<br />
      <br />
      Hope y'all enjoy them. All comments gratefully appriciated, even if you just wasted enough of your valuable time to call me a time-wasting loser ;)<br />

      I would look at your pack, but i'm using a laptop now, so even trying to open avs is asking for trouble.

      <p class="post-content">not bad for a first release.<br />
      i like "music fish 2", it has nice colors.<br />
      "cinematropic" is not bad, too. They are both simple but i (personally) like them.<br />
      <br />
      The others are not quite my taste, have seen this style too often...</p>
