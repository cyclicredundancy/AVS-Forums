<div class="posttext">Heh all,<br />
<br />
   Been building a new APE -- uses spectral similarity to directly drive image generation.  I'm getting some pretty cool results, but by far the best stuff happens when it's stacked with a couple other filters.  That's where you guys come in -- I'm looking to release with a pack of interesting presets, and I'm pretty new to the whole world of AVS.<br />
<br />
   What's the output of my APE, LudiVu?  See:<br />
<br />
   http://www.doxpara.com/ludivu/<br />
<br />
   ...and this is with an incredibly naive similarity metric.  Anyway, release is going to be at Defcon (yes, the huge hacking con), and I'll be giving away full source as well.  So, if you're interested in being part of the release pack, respond here or send a mail to dan@doxpara.com.  If possible, could you give me an example of your existing work?<br />
<br />
   I expect you'll have a couple of feature requests, so I'm trying to limit the number of people in for the AVS pre-release.  But show me whatcha got :)<br />

<div class="posttext">Uh, yes, that's kinda the point of submitting a URL.<br />
<br />
www.doxpara.com/ludivu<br />
<br />
Or, if that doesn't work:<br />
<br />
www.doxpara.com ludivu (put a slash before)<br />
<br />
(Ironically, I know exactly why such a filter would be in place.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">clicking on quote brings up the urls, so i saw the pics.<br />
so what does it do? it looks like a coloured version of the timescope...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It compares the spectrum being emitted now, to the spectrum of the last n seconds (n being determined by size of display divided by framerate).  Whenever there's a repeat, vertical lines form, with the timbre of the present instruments rather directly creating color and shape.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So it takes the difference between two spectrum samples, and draws the output?</div></div><hr />

<br />
   It's not a raw difference -- it's scaled to relative similarity, and bucketized in terms of bass, midrange, and treble.  One line is rendered at a time, with history thrown backwards to the left.<br />
<br />
   Interested in playing with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">J.Melo</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th July 2007, 05:09</div></div>

<div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm curious as to how it works/looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't mean to be rude at all, but I'm still a bit doubtful about how useful it will really be..<br />
<br />
I'm wondering: <br />
- Does the APE render the entire screen pixel by pixel or are there two lines that move away after some time my means of for example a Movement?<br />
- is it customizable, and if so, what can you change?<br />
<br />
- I notice you're running AVS at an extremely high resolution. Does it also look good at 400x300 or 512x384?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dakami</div><div class="date small text-muted">18th July 2007, 02:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The APE has been designed to be remixed, so I intentionally render the entire screen and handle scrolling myself.  This introduces a perf penalty, however.<br />
<br />
It's quite customizable, and I'm coming here to find out what other modifications I should add before initial release.<br />
<br />
It's actually much faster and more visually responsive at low resolutions.  The hi-res is just so I can get a larger view of what's going on.<br />
<br />
Care to play with it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">can you give us a pic of the editor interface one can work with? so that we can get a faint idea of how customizable it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm very interrested in this new ape.<br />
Sign me up for beta testing. I could work as the lowest end of the computer speed food chain of your tests. heh.<br />
But when i saw the picture i said wow i must have this at once. so could you email me the current ape to charpoketron@yahoo.com.</div></div><hr />

   It's just a couple of options, to drive whether I show a timescope, how wide the spectrum is, whether to scroll horizontally or vertically, and how much of the screen to render to.<br />
<br />
   I'm coming here first to find out what options must exist for the initial release :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">what exactly is the benefit of your APE vs a superscope with according code and optionally a trans/movement?<br />
<br />
i think you could even do that with a timescope+some fancy blending if i understood you right</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">a hint for the future: don't put the version in the filename and add a version resource</div></div><hr />

<br />
   If you've got an idea for how to port this to Superscope, I'd certainly be interested.  The code is not complex, but it's fairly mathematically heavy.<br />

   It ain't released yet (coming out at Defcon, where I'm kinda sorta using WinAMP as a hacking tool), what you're saying is _exactly_ why I'm coming here first.  avstut is just there because that's what the SDK emits.  Now, you mention version resource:  Clarify?</div></div><hr />

<br />
mark the ape file and go to the version tab. it's good to put the version there, so installers can check if the user has a newer version already - so it doesn't get overwritten by an older version.</div></div><hr />

   Hmm, you mean in the DLL metadata?<br />

   OK, I can get that taken care of.</div></div><hr />
