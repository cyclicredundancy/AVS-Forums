<div class="posttext">Peeps help, <br />
<br />
Anyone know how I can get a audio feed from my decks and mixers through to the computer and get it to pick up the sound and display the funky visualizations based on this onto a projector? <br />
<br />
Cheers Matty</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well the projector you just plug in like a monitor (as long as you have a suitable graphics card).<br />
<br />
For the sound take a feed from the mixer (if you're not using it just use the booth) and plug it into the line in on your sound card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Once you've hooked the mixer up to the line in on your soundcard, then open the location &quot;line://&quot; or &quot;linein://&quot; (without the quotes) (I don't remember which one it is, try both of them) to see it in Winamp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorted. Cheers guys, Here's the full run down for anyone else. <br />
<br />
From mixer - standard RCA connector to line in on your sound card.<br />
<br />
In Windows double click Volume icon. Open 'Properties' and select Recording. Press OK for the changes to be saved by Windows. You can then change the volume if you want. <br />
<br />
In Winamp go to Properties and 'Input' select the line in from the list (if nothing here go to to get a line in plugin for winamp - Jasper van der Gronde has made one). <br />
<br />
Then click 'add' and select 'add URL'. In the box that appears type in &quot;linein://&quot; (without the quotes), click play and its all go. <br />
<br />
Although the visualisation stuff doesnt really feed off the music I play, it works..... <br />
<br />
Cheers Matt</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Make sure you've set the recording volume so it doesn't clip the sound or distort it, and so it isn't too quiet, as this may reduce the fluidity of any visualisations you run.<br />
<br />
It also helps if you've got a better soundcard as then the quality of the sampled sound will be better to respond to.</div></div><hr />
