			<strong>Possibility to default AVS to fullscreen</strong><br />
		
		

		I am using WinAMP and AVS on a HTPC (Home Theater PC), where the PC is actually controlled by a remote control.<br />
<br />
I would make life much easier if there was an option for AVS to default to fullscreen.<br />
<br />
So, I am putting this in my wishlist.:)<br />

		Perhps you failed to notice the big post saying &quot;The current AVS wishlist&quot; containing none other than this: 
	<blockquote>

 please check that post or perform a simple search before posting something to add to the wishlist next time, ok.

		Im suprised that someone runs AVS on a HTPC considering that AVS is slow &amp; can only be runned in low resolutions if you want somewhat decent performance O_o<br />
<br />
Anyway, Raz is right, you should've searched the forums. But atleast you weren't screaming like most of the newbies who post here once are.

		I <u>did</u> search.:hang: <br />
<br />
&quot;avs AND fullscreen&quot; gives too many results (386)<br />
&quot;avs AND fullscreen AND default&quot; does not find this post.<br />
<br />
But since you guys are so smart, try to find the post you mention above doing a search, and let me know what keywords you use.<br />

And you don't even need to search for it, it's on top of the AVS Wishlist forum.

		Tugg's right, but if you did search for &quot;AVS fullscreen&quot; just in the AVS Wishlist section, several come up including the Wishlist and<br />

		btw. Do the functions familiar from real search engines work in the forums? like using AND , NOT &amp; OR ? Maybe that's the problem, too many people try to use the search like a normal search engine?

		Ii believe they don't realize search button.<br />
Furthermore, noobs dont see the forums as a kind of knowledge base, just a place where more experienced people are expected to be around.<br />
<br />
We should open a newbie-questions area where they can post their questions and choose some dedicated members as mods, or lets say advisers to stop the mods discussion.

That's from the search page:
	<blockquote>
			
				<b>Advanced query:</b> Join words with AND, OR and NOT to control your search in more detail.<br />
Add asterisks (*) to use wild cards in your search (*bullet* matches vBulletin etc.)</blockquote>
And by the way, with the price of current CPUs, one can afford a HTPC with a decent CPU (I am using a Athlon XP 2000+). I also use it to run MAME. Pretty cool!<br />

		It doesn't matter that you did search theres a sticky post at the top of the page in big clear letters saying &quot;The current AVS wishlist&quot;, you should've checked there. I don't mean to sound really irritated but it does leave the regulars less peeved if you take a look around for what you want beforehand.
