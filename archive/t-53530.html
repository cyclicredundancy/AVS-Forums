      <p class="post-content">One really annoying thing about AVS is it does not seem to tell you what preset you are on. So if you are hitting the spacebar and watching all the pretty colors and you see one that you like and would like to know what it is called so that you can go back to it later, well, you can't. And that sucks. Also, in the transitions section, it lets you decide what it will do when it randomly chooses a preset or when it goes the next or previous preset. Now, random, I know how to do. But are there actually buttons to go to the next or previous preset? If so, I haven't seen them.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can only save a preset to a hotkey. (Settings -&gt; Presets/hotkeys) You can't cycle them all with 1 key (for now).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, but what about this:<br />
      <br />
      Lets say I hit the spacebar and AVS randomly selects a preset. Is there a way to find out what preset I am on?<br />
      <br />
      Also, in the transitions section there is a checkbox for "Enable transition on next/prev". What does that do? Because there does not seem to be a way to switch to the very next or previouse preset in the directory. Only spacebar for random selection.</p>

      <p class="post-content">1st question: No, not yet.<br />
      <br />
      2nd question: "Enable transition on next/prev" is a smooth transition between the changes of the presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PLS KABOON answer only if you know !!!</strong><br />
      1:YES if you have AVS v2.5 (it cames with WINAMP v.2.76) and name of preset is showed at the bottom of "Winamp AVS Editor" window<br />
      <br />
      2:Pres "R" fro stop/start random play<br />
      pres "U" and "Y" for forward and backward trought AVS presets<br />
      Pres "T" and you will see song title<br />
