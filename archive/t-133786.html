      Is it possible to run AVS visualizations in a custom app? Assuming I've got the waveform and frequency data, is it possible to initialize the AVS engine and feed it the data? I can't seem to find an API.<br />

      <p class="post-content">no, perhaps you could say what you wanted to do withg this external app.. im sure their is some way you could use a winamp pplug to fulfil your needs rather than using a totaly different app with an avs plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm writing a performance based realtime video mixing application and I'd like to add the ability to include AVS visualizations. If there is no way to host the AVS engine, would it be possible to write an APE that places the pixel data in a memory-mapped file which can be also used by my mixer process?</p>

      <p class="post-content">ahhh.. now your talking.. you sounded like some schmuck that wanted to do something the hard way with no programming knowledge..<br />
      everyone responded no, because they didnt want to explain the process of writing ape's, and then explain what an ape is blah blah blah.<br />
      <br />
      sorry 'bout all that. Yes, it would definatly be possible. As you suspected, it would be far easyer to use a sort of post-rendering extraction than it would be to get avs running seperatly from winamp. though im sure both are possible.<br />
      <br />
      For the first option, you would have to write a couple of ape's: one to replace the winamp spectrum, osc data (and maybe even beat detection) with what is running through your prog. And another to save the screen buffer into mem so that you can use it somewhere else. Both wouldnt be very hard to program as far as i can imagine (though i couldnt do either cause im shite).<br />
      <br />
      You probably should track down someone with specific knowldge of avs ape codeing. Like unconed on this board.<br />
      Out of interest, what else are you doing with this prog, and what language?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well actually you CAN fire up AVS without Winamp if you have the oscilloscope and spectrum data (look at the winamp plugin sdk to see what a plugin receives from winamp), but then AVS would still create its own window so you wouldn't be able to do much with it (like post-processing).<br />
      <br />
      An APE receives a pointer to 2 32-bit RGB0 framebuffers and can either simply modify the first, or put its result in the second framebuffer and tell AVS to use that instead.<br />
      The only problem is that an APE is part of the preset you're viewing. So if you make an APE that captures the frame and sends it to your program, you'd need to modify every preset to include that APE, and make sure that it works even when an instance of the APE is destroyed and another is created.<br />

      </blockquote>you can include AVS as a videostream (capturing the overlay). a friend of mine and myself have been doing this in a quicktime stream and we already experimenting with NSV streams. i think nullsoft itself will support an easier way to allow this (check the .plan files, they mention some upcoming NSV features).

      </blockquote>How exactly would you do this? How would you host the plugin? I already have the scope/spectrum data. I just want to create the AVS plugin and pass in the data. If it creates a window, that's fine as long as I can hide it and grab the pixels.

      the hotlist application from magix:) adds a beatdetection ape to every avs played.. could it also add the grabber ape?!!..</p>
