<div class="posttext">I searched the entire sub-forum but didnt see any BUMP wish, so here goes:<br />
<br />
bump intensity can be dynamically changed by using some varible like bi=getspec(0,0,0) or some thing like that.<br />
what do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can already do that :)<br />
And the value indeed is bi :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Lol, have you ever even looked the bump &amp; it's descriptions? It's right there! :D<br />
<br />
&quot;bi: Bump intesity, ranges from 0 (flat) to 1 (max specified bump, default)&quot;<br />
<br />
What this means is that you first set the intensity from the slider and then by shifting values from 0 to 1 you get bump intensity from 0 to the specified point in the slider.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, i never used much Bump until now.<br />
<br />
I mostly got stuck in things like dynamic onbeat rotation &amp; directon shifter with smooth movement fadeouts and crap like that ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It would be nice if we had that for the waterbump(position and intensety defied by code), meaby someone would actualy use it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">eh...water bump already makes the framerate sink like a rock, so making it dynamic would only make it slower.  Plus, it would lead to a new generation of n00b packs. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Too true, i came here and read all your noob-pack hating posts. Thats why -&gt;I&lt;- never released an annoying noob pack. I never released anything. Water bump is a crap effect anyway. You can do one FPS munching thing with it, thats it. Useless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like water bump dammit.  I've got at least one preset lined up for tff3.0 so far...and it's (at least) fairly good imho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Water Bump is so annoyingly slow...Never saw it used correctly or if it even was looking good, with a decent framerate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ive never actually looked at the avswishlist before.. its seems like a dead wish to me. But here is what i want in the bump.<br />
The bump has the potential to be a VERY powerful avs tool. I can't believe its so fast, considering all the code behind bump-mapping.  It seems that most people do not really know whsat it is for, judging by the majority of its implementations. <br />
<br />
*It needs more dynamics to work well, if you could control the DIRECTION of the light source as well as the origin, you could implement it very well into 3d DM presets. <br />
<br />
*This is probably a bad idea, because it would slow down the whole thing, but... If you could change the 'z' value, (the depth of the render) dynamically, instead of it just computing it according to onscreen color, you could have lots of fun.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
*multiple light sources???</div></div><hr />
