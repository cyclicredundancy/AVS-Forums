		Just FYI. Yes, we know about the fact that you all have requests for AVS. We are aware that there hasn't been any movement on AVS. We love AVS as much as you do. <br />
<br />
Just keep in mind, if you hadn't noticed, there's a lot of work to do on Winamp3 to begin with. When we're at a place where AVS will receive love, trust me, you'll all know about it.<br />
<br />
We've just got a lot on our plate right now, so please, just sit back... relax... Your emails aren't going to change it's priority level in the immediate future.<br />

		Thanks Mr Poopiehead :p (see profile). This is what I figured was going to happen. Any idea when changes could begin in avs?

		Btw this is a response to a mail I sent to Steve... (thanks for replying)<br />
<br />
Here's the original:<br />
<br />

	<blockquote>
			
				Hi,<br />
<br />
with the risk of possibly wasting a couple of minutes of your precious time with a message that doesn't concern you at all (and which you might not be able to redirect to listening ears), I'm sending you this message about the AVS community. It's not intended for you really, but I've gotten the impression that you're the (only?) person who steps out of the Ivory Tower which is Nullsoft the most...<br />
<br />
I'm Steven Wittens, author of the AVS packs 'Whacko AVS' (featured on winamp.com at the moment). Considering I've been making AVSes for the past 2 years, AVS is a pretty important hobby for me. I'm also an active member of the AVS community (I maintained the FAQ and Wishlist collection threads on the AVS forums).<br />
<br />
Now I don't know what you people over at Nullsoft think about AVS, but to many people it is just way too cool. Since its beginning, presets have become an art-form in themselves: trying to do the prettiest, most complicated or most unique presets and succeeding in creating something really neat is extremely gratifying. I've personally spent countless hours perfecting my presets and I know many others who have done the same. Not just technically, but visually too.<br />
<br />
Now why am I bugging you with this? Well for the simple reason that virtually no-one in the AVS community has heard *anything* about AVS' development ever since v2.5. The most we heard was an unreliable source who claimed that AVS was being refactored completely and integrated with Maki and such.<br />
We'd love nothing more than AVS development: just look at the incredibly huge wishlist on the AVS Wishlist forums, and all the questions about extra features which cannot be implemented through APE's (AVS Plug-in Effects). Trust me, I've tried a lot :) (I've finally figured out a way to share variables between different components like scopes/dms through a very hackish method).<br />
<br />
So please, if AVS hasn't been shoved into the Realm of Forgotten Software Projects(tm), inform the AVS community of your progress. Post a simple thread about its status, but don't leave us in the dark. Having to shrug everyone off with &quot;AVS isn't being developed anymore&quot; when they suggest something isn't fun either. I think I speak for most of the AVS preset authors.<br />
<br />
But don't just do it for the AVS authors: in case you hadn't noticed, Windows' Media Player 9 has finally gotten a Visualisation SDK and has been touting its plug-in architecture (see wmplugins.com), but creating them requires knowledge of C++ (a plug-in is a COM object) and complicated coding.<br />
AVS is an amazingly easy to use, powerful, unique visualisation plug-in, unique to Winamp3. It gives Winamp3 yet another edge over those sucky rival players: and that's something you guys *are* certainly interested in. Who cares about prebuilt visualisations when you can make your own?</blockquote>

		It's not that simple, so I'm not giving it out yet until I can make sure it's as easy as it can get.<br />
<br />
Basically I found out at APEs can modify the spectrum and oscilloscope data, because APEs receive the memory position of the data and not the data itself.<br />
So what you do is make a superscope that draws dots in certain colors in the upper-left, and then the APE takes those colors and inserts them into the oscilloscope values, so you can read them with getosc(). However you only get limited precision (colors have only 0-255 values) and the APE is not configurable yet.<br />
<br />
So, be patient. Don't get your hopes up too much though: unless it's for really complicated scopes, this APE will be slower than calculating everything in each scope. It's not like setting variable 'a' in one scope and reading 'a' in another...

		dude, if you needed to sync rotating 3D ssc's you can get a random number between 0-256 for each axis - and that's only if you use one point for rotation.  you could get a semi-gaussian random between 0-16777216 for each axis if you wanted to, and even then you have 257 global variables left that you can use.  and that's only for getspec!  &quot;low precision&quot; my ass :p

		Well, that's still nice, but I can't wait until they update AVS. Hey, even without random numbers it still offers a way to store more than 64 variables. Very nice.

		we would be overun with water moving particle and blitter feedback presets and roto blitter and water combinations and that bug that makes all the grey when you add a heavy blur. well simple enough, there would be no Zero-G maze 3 :(.
