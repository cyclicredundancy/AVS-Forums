      I made this nifty "Cube", (even though it's been probably been dont before), but I can't get any good colors or background effects to go with it. It would be really nice of anybody if they could remix this somehow.</p>

      Very nice job, although I can't figure out how to remix it. Maybe I'll try harder later. :)<br />

      Hey, did you know that we actually live really close together? I'd say about 110 miles apart. That's actually not too far!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually Pixelcraft, I ddin't know we lived that close, scary man... But with the cube it was pretty easy to make I guess, but it sorta made itself because I was trying to make just one flat plane, but somehow the u=bnot(u)code bit just slipped in there, and I got this, I guess, but no one really cares about that. The main thing I have been having problems with is using buffers saves and things to make nifty backgrounds with my superscopes, all I'm really hoping for is somebody to come up with some cool background idea that I didn't even know could work. I am also working on remaking the scopes to try and fix up the line problem, (change the first superscope from dots to lines), and get rid of the u=bnot(u) bit, I am hoping to have that done by tommorrow.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Finished the new cube, I still mkae this thing look ugly as hell with any backgrounds/different colors/eye candy, but damn this thing is sexy. I was going to name this Getosc³, but I found out that my Zip program doesn't allow files to have the "³" charector in them, so I named it this instead.</p>
