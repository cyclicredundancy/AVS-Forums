<div class="posttext">I think turning AVS from a collection of filters into a scripting language would be awesome.<br />
<br />
It could support the filters as separate functions, use variables, loops, etc.  For example, the syntax for SuperScope would be:<br />
<br />
Render-&gt;SuperScope(&quot;n=800&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;x=i*2-1;y=v&quot;);<br />
<br />
Variables would be interpolated into &quot;&quot; strings, etc.  You could also programmatically create new buffers, mix different buffers into a new one: (Omitting a buffer assumes the global buffer, the one that is displayed when the script reaches the end.)<br />
<br />
$buf=new Buffer;  #create new buffers<br />
$buft=new Buffer;<br />
#render in each buffer<br />
$buf-&gt;Render-&gt;SuperScope(&quot;n=800&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;x=i*2-1;y=v&quot;);<br />
$buft-&gt;Render-&gt;SuperScope(&quot;n=800&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;y=i*2-1;x=v&quot;);<br />
#blend them together into the main buffer<br />
Blend('50/50',$buf,$buft);<br />
<br />
Writing presets would be much more complex, but amazing things could be done with it.<br />
<br />
This would have to be implemented in AVS for Winamp2, because I think Winamp3's AVS is wayyyy to slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Like it isn't hard enough to do avs right now...<br />
Surely it could (maybe) do wonderful things, but it could also take artists away from avs since avs would be more coding then and avs isn't always about code. Also you might want to remember that not everybody can code/script.<br />
<br />
Bad idea, because then i would have to quit doing AVS :down: :hang:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Another option would be yo have a dual-mode AVS... a filter mode and a script mode.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It could just be me, but I thought AVS was created so people could EASILY create visualizations.  Here's an idea for you: As long as you're thinking of completely changing AVS, why don't you make a new plugin with your own ideas on your own time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was basicly what i ment, but i think i said it in a bit confusing way :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, to implement your suggestion, AVS would would have to be rewritten from the ground up. Besides that whole varibale and loop think has been on the list for a while. :p</div></div><hr />
