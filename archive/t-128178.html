      It would be cool to have a few variables which were controled by keys.<br />
      like key1=1 if pressed and 0 when not.<br />
      <br />
      I was sure someone asked this before but I couldnt find it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not too hard to implement this in an ape so you can getosc a certain point, the only problem is that tons of keys are already used by AVS and Winamp.</p>

      That would be quite fun :) But would totally kill the visualization thing i bet.<br />
      <br />
      Just imagine UnConeD's WolfAVStein 3D which you could control yourself :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Like unconed said, you can read in keypresses using ape's, so it could be possible. Especially with UnConeD's getosc global variable hack(which he won't release..:( ).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Getosc global variable hack ? wtf ? I think i`ll search the forums. A cool wish : to have multiple instances of AVS opened and the avs windows docked and to be able to "copy/paste" an object from a preset into another preset.Drag &amp; drop.Understand ? It would be sweet.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah one implementation is games:)<br />
      but you could also code stuf (color changes, pulsing of objects,...),<br />
      so that VJs could do somethin besides changeing presets.<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: Yeah I thought of that the first time I looked at the "arrow keys":(.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Phaze, UnConeD has made an ape that he says will allow him to modify the getspec/getosc data and therefore use it as global variable storage. He won't release it though, because it is a "hack". So I guess we are going to have to wait until they start working on AVS again.</p>
