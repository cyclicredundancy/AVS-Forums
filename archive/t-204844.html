<div class="posttext">Thanks for the link.<br />
I did search, but the thread does not include the keywords I was looking for. Believe me, I'd rather have found a quick answer to my problem instead of opening a new thread and wait a few days for the answer. <br />
It seems to be popular to answer every question that was asked before with eyes-rolling and &quot;you should have searched&quot;, while I'm confinced that most people did so and would prefer to find the answer in the fist way or the FAQ. <br />
And if I've found the link, I would still have asked if it has been implemented, since the request is three years old.<br />
So I propose to put it on the wishlist, could one of the admins please move this thread there? (I don't want to next dude flaming me for cross-posting :rolleyes:  )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for your info.<br />
I checked avs playlister and lost expectation of my life. This program is unusable, horribly designed, and crashed two times in 15 minutes.<br />
Hotlist is stucked in a beta version with no further active development.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This would require a general purpose plugin.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Why does it require a plugin? <br />
AVS already knows when a new song starts, you can see this in the beat detection section: There you can choose how to detect the beats when a new song starts (adapt or learn new).<br />
So the trigger ist there. <br />
All what it needs is to connect it to the switch preset section.</div></div><hr />

I suppose the main topic of the thread was something else. He wanted a new preset for every new song. <br />

don't think so narrow :)<br />
APEs can (and do!) run while not added to a preset, too.<br />
here is an example http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7800156 :)<br />
they can even compile code and do other nice things without being ever added to a preset</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">no your problem isn`t solved yet. You should wait until one of those ape-freaks solved it ;)<br />
I don't get that idea, that an ape can work, while it's not in the current preset. But it might be possible...</div></div><hr />

Do you know where it is? <br />
here it is:  Auto preset cycler (http://goebish.free.fr/vfx/gen_avs_cycler.zip) <br />
uncompress it in your winamp/plugins directory.<br />
it's a general purpose plugin, simple to config:<br />
http://goebish.free.fr/vfx/aps_config.jpg <br />
<br />
random preset must be disabled in AVS config, transitions can be enabled, just configure your avs editor as there:<br />

Hope you won't lose expectation of your life just another time ;)<br />

<div class="posttext">i have no idea why i get that! Suddenly it was there and i cannot remove it again! So i can't reproduce it either, im still having it... :( I reinstalled your plugin but i still get this win-notifications sound when it loads a new preset...<br />
At first i thought it's because of the prompt-box you get when you made changes to a preset. But since i reinstalled the plugin and loaded an untouched preset the problem shouldn't be there anymore... :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, I did not lose anything again. It did not crash. Thanks. <br />
<br />
But:<br />
It seemed to work the first few minutes, but than there was a transition in the middle of a song. Than I rememebered you wanted the random preset change disabled (why?) so I did and from that time I never had a preset change again.<br />
I tried de-activating and activating again, re-started winamp.<br />
No change. I did not even get the windows ding that ^..^ gets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it seems that only i am getting that ding, so it's not that bad. (Also i don't really need this plugin). However it seems that it doesn't have anything to do with the &quot;save changes&quot; box. Cause i still get that sound when this feature is disabled. Any idea why it could be? btw &quot;random preset advance&quot; is disabled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Nothing. Not even a &quot;ding&quot;.<br />

with &quot;Random&quot; on/off,<br />
with &quot;randomly switch presets&quot; off/on and 10/30/100/1000 seconds<br />
<br />
At least my bloodpressure did not go up, so I assume the program does not do any harm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">goebish</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th March 2005, 06:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Problem with sound was because I sent a WM_SYSKEYDOWN message to the avs window instead of WM_KEYDOWN followed by WM_KEYUP.<br />
Titule I really don't know what's wrong with you. Can some more people give it a try ?<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
I'm just looking at the include files of the new SDK and I see:<br />
<br />
#define IPC_SETVISWND 611 // param is hwnd, setting this allows you to receive ID_VIS_NEXT/PREVOUS/RANDOM/FS wm_commands<br />
#define ID_VIS_NEXT                     40382<br />
#define ID_VIS_PREV                     40383<br />
#define ID_VIS_RANDOM                   40384<br />
#define ID_VIS_FS                       40389<br />
#define ID_VIS_CFG                      40390<br />
#define ID_VIS_MENU                     40391<br />
<br />
#define IPC_GETVISWND 612 // returns the vis cmd handler hwnd<br />
#define IPC_ISVISRUNNING 613<br />
#define IPC_CB_VISRANDOM 628 // param is status of random <br />
<br />
So I think I can code it a proper way than sending keydown/keyup messages to the avs window after retrieving his handle with FindWindow/FindWindowEx<br />
Time to go to work now, I'll update it this evening.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry can't really follow. Actually i have no idea about real coding things. However the plugin works fine for me, although i found another bug: it seems as if you cannot deactivate it permanently. Everytime i deactivate it and restart winamp it is activated again.

<div class="posttext">Seems you never give up? Good, I appreciate that, but, sorry to say that:<br />
No.<br />
The configuration window and the version number has changed. (nice work, though :))<br />
But nothing else.<br />
I think now that it never worked and the first transitions I observed were the random transitions every 10 secs.<br />
I got so unsure that I even pressed the &quot;next&quot; button to see if there are ANY preset changes (it worked).<br />
<br />
How can I help? Maybe you implement to write debug-output to a file that I can send you?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">well, here it works fine now, without re-enabling on winamp restart and without ding. Dunno, perhaps it's a matter of different winamp versions, that it doesn't work for you titule?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There's nothing wrong with me..<br />
Winamp switches to the next preset when I press 'u' as well as pressing the &quot;next&quot; button.<br />
It just don' switch preset when the next song starts playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:weird: <br />
Just tried again, nothing.<br />
<br />
When is the preset supposed to change? <br />
Do I need to set the transition?<br />
Do I have too many presets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd March 2005, 21:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">as the name says it should change to a new preset whenever a new song starts or the current song restarts.<br />
<br />
neither do you have to set a specific kind of transitions nor does the number of presets matter. When i tested that plugin i tried all different transition settings and i couldn't find one that doesn't work.<br />
Concerning the number of presets: i guess the plugin recognizes when a new song starts and then simply tells avs to do the same that happens when you press space. So i don't think that the plugin cares about the number of presets, otherwise random-preset-on-spacebar wouldn't work either! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">sorry can't help you any further...<br />
<br />
btw why did you have to set everthing up again after reinstall? Usually it keeps the former settings?! However i'm no expert for winamp troubleshooting ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Even goebish, who actually made that plugin, has no clue why it doesn't work for titule, strange thing...<br />
<br />
It's somehow funny, that titule was the one who asked for this plugin and now when it's made it only works for the ones who don't really need it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think i know what is the problem with Titule<br />
It's the prioroty of plug-ins. I had the same problem, but then i unninstaled some plugins and it worked. <br />
Titule where  you have your list of plugins in General purpose window, on which place is it, the AVS presets cycler?<br />
On one computer i have it on last and it works, but on the other i had it on first place (dind't work) so I uninstaled some plugins (Nulsoft modern skin support, Nulsoft Global hotkeys and another but I don't the name, and I can't tell you why I unninstaled this plugins,) So this solved my problem, that may be the same as Titules.<br />
<br />
But on the 3'rd comp i have this problem. when i start winamp i have an error and it says:<br />
<br />
This application has failed to start because MSVCR71.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried reinstalling winamp, tried the updated version of plugin, <br />
tried to use winamop v5.08e, latest winamp version, and still the same :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because I compiled it with visual studio 2003. Get this dll at http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71 and put it in your windows\system32 folder, should fix the problem.<br />
<br />
By the way, Happy New Year to all avser's :)</div></div><hr />
