<div class="posttext">arrgh i'm dying, this is the definite sh*t!<br />
sorry tug, you said you took them off because of comments, but whoa!<br />
and i haven't even seen 10% yet...<br />
<br />
/get's back to drooling over the presets<br />
<br />
/edit: and can anybody say which pack has which number?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I took everything down, because of the expectations people had over me (or that's what i tought). In short, i crumbled under pressure and just went into a fuck-all berserker stage.<br />
<br />
About numbers, yeah i have them now numbered correctly on my own computer and i was planning on releasing a collection that consists the packs from 1-19 (functions is 20 which is online already)<br />
<br />
I just need to get over my lazyness to do a proper release (with installer/disclaimer/screenshot and whatnot), but so far i haven't :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">but think! you could even get a DD, probably.<br />
kidding...<br />
<br />
i already started some detective work and tried to number them from your comments.<br />
like &quot;yeah, this is my 463th pack and since my last pack called &quot;lalala&quot; dreadful things happened&quot;<br />
it was fun, but could only number 5 or 6 of them...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">In this image (which was done for humour purposes, don't ask) you can see the numbering of the packs.<br />
