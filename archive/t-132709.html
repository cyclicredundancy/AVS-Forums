		with 3 new presets ... at the bottom of this page :<br />

<br />
Sorry, it's still in french, but I give you a short description of them in english here :<br />
<br />
Galaxie : You're moving around a dancing galaxy. And there's a little surprise on beat ...<br />
<br />
Quidditch : Just for fun (and for my daughters both in love with H. Potter). Try to load it  before the first beat ...<br />
<br />
Electrique : A simulation of an electrical engine I can't remember the name.<br />
<br />
If you want to download all the presets of the page, there's a link on a zip file at the beginning of the page [for those who knows, I've done it ;-)].<br />
<br />
That's all folks !

		Good work again PiR, excellent coding.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Galaxy</u></b> - Nice and all, but doesn't really &quot;fly&quot; in my opinion. It's a bit too blurry and dark i think, though that might be different with high fps &amp; high resolution.<br />
<br />
<b><u>quidditch</u></b> - Hahaha, that's amazing superscope work you got there :up: Technically i love it, but since im not a harry potter fan i don't get any extra kicks out of it :)<br />
<br />
<b><u>eletrique</u></b> - I like it, though the colors aren't quite in place sort of said, it response great to music. Good one :up:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you should put some english comments on your presets, do a couple more and then pimp them with nsis and put a pack on winamp.com, because your work is quite good :)<br />
<br />
Hope to see more in the future.

		Nice work.<br />
I don't like the galaxy one too much because the idea is way overdone. Still a nice preset though.<br />
I thought the quiditch one looked more like a garden with butterflies and the like floating around. Nice<br />
That electric balls looks great. I was doing something similar but yours is better. Nice job.

		I wasn't to impressed with Galaxie and Electrique. They looked nice, but I didn't think there was enough action in them.<br />
<br />
Quiddich was pretty cool, but why was nobody chasing the golden snitch? :p

		i hate harry pothead!! But the quidditch preset is very nice though i agree with raz,looks more like a garden :) Also the galaxy preset is a bit too dark for a galaxy and electrique is cool,but could be better.Excellent work dude!

		Thanks to all !<br />
<br />
Some answers ...<br />
<br />
For all : I generally test my presets in fullscreen 800x600, 80%, pixel doubling, no wait for retrace (PIII at 933 MHz). As long as the framerate is not above 20 fps, I try to optimize / reduce the preset. That's my reference.<br />
So, my presets are constructed to be seen in that mode : this explains the &quot;butterflies&quot; and other &quot;blurry&quot; ...<br />
<br />
For Jaheckelsafar : I tried to make the &quot;catchers&quot; (in french, &quot;attrapeurs&quot;) chase the golden snitch, but, they were to good and always catch it at the end (that means the end of the game ...). So, I let them walking all over the &quot;garden&quot; :-)<br />
<br />
For Shreyas_Potnis : I tried too, but I had a big problem with the order of the draws, the stands were all in front of or back to the players. I didn't find a way to draw them before and/or after the players (in fact, I do not search very seriously ...).<br />
<br />
For Tuggumi : I've tried to understand how to use NSIS, but ... :(<br />
<br />
Thanks to all again !

		one mistake in the quidditch I found: there are only 3 chasers in one team.<br />
tip: use a quaffle and a bludger too.<br />
and as for: &quot;I didn't find a way to draw them before and/or after the players &quot; <br />
I think using a maximum blend will solve the problem

		Well, maximum blend will show players by transparency if stands are dark and cover them if they're bright.<br />
<br />
About quaffle (in french &quot;souafle&quot;) and bludger (in french &quot;cognard&quot;), I haven't put them because the first one is generally in some hands, and the second one is too small and not lighting ...<br />
<br />
About the 3 chasers, I think we have a translation problem, because each team has :<br />
1 goal, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 catcher<br />
in french :<br />
1 gardien, 3 poursuiveurs, 2 batteurs, 1 attrapeur.<br />
<br />
You can easily see them if you start the preset without music ...

		I've changed the preset. There are now 3 chasers in each teams.<br />
As I have a little more available resources, I've made a little improvement in the drawing of the hoops.<br />
<br />
The new version is in my site. <br />

		Galaxie: a little blurry, like people have said.  Make the explosion brighter.<br />
<br />
quidditch: nice!  add the other balls, have them go through goals, etc.<br />
<br />
electrique: a plasma ball?  colors need to be more purply, more movement, esp. in 3D<br />
<br />
A way to do the transparencies: <br />
<br />
do your 'background stuff'<br />
add a replace buffersave to #1<br />
<br />
do the 'over stuff'<br />
replace buffersave to #2<br />
multiply --&gt; infinite square<br />
invert<br />
<br />
effect list (ignore/multiply)<br />
..buffer restore (replace) #1<br />
[end effect list]<br />
buffer restore (max) #2<br />
<br />
(there might be a better way, this is what I have found to work)
