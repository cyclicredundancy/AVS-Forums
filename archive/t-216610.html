<div class="posttext">ok people, here's the deal. i'm currently working on volume 7.<br />
i'm not doing well. every preset is turning out to be a remix, so i've decided to make this a pure remix pack. now to add something special, i'm opening this project to everyone interested. basically, if you want your name in volume 7 and plastered on my dA page, get any of my presets, remix them however you want, and send them back to me and i'll put them in v7. if that doesn't work, i'll share the pack how it is, and allow people to remix those before i release it properly.<br />
you can find every preset i've ever made right here: http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/12050941/<br />
<br />
make as many (or as little as you want) and then send them to me at mr_nudge(a)hotmail.com</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm in! Made a preset based on the dm of plasma rings ages ago when i was pretty new here and v.4 was just released. Going to send it to you.<br />
<br />
BTW: Is there any deadline or something? Perhaps i can do some more.<br />
<br />
//Edit: it just came back to me that i also remixed another preset of yours but i couldn't find it on my HD so i searched the forums and found it here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1513077#post1513077).<br />
Feel free to use it either...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">deadline is whenever i have 15 presets on total, i have 7 atm</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">People will be much more likely to cooperate if you give them a solid deadline. It's just more practical.<br />
<br />
If you say &quot;when I have X presets&quot; then there is no guarantee for anyone who starts remixing to actually be included in the pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh btw: 28th of June will be pretty good. As long as you don't have enough remixes from me yet. (how many are it actually? or how many more would you like me to make?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th May 2005, 09:07</div></div>

<br />
<div class="posttext">ok, then i'll try to make some more...<br />
Hope there are a few others that come to join that project (the more others join, the less remixes i have to do ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh man, I am so in! If you don't like any thing I remix, I understand not including them, but I think I can get at least one or two going.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th June 2005, 12:20</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">oh man! im so sorry! i completely forgot about this!<br />
how many remixes from me do you have as yet? Perhaps i can find something else to remix from the presets in your pre-release?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th June 2005, 18:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">that's great beeferoni...any presets would be welcome..unless their just plan shit..but i've seen some of your work and it's not bad at all<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">26th June 2005, 14:47</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Ok, i promise to make at least one more!<br />
But actually you should have two remixes from me already, but i just guess that you overlooked my edited note above (in my first post). So i'll just attach it here. Feel free to use it (if you like it of course):</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh, oops. I just read back a few, and you said you are doing the final release on the 11th, eh? Well I sent 3 more your way. I hope I can finish another one or two by then. :up:</div></div><hr />

Congrats! Very cool pack! And also a nice bunch of versatile remixes!<br />
<br />
btw: i had to laugh when i saw wotl's remix, he did the same with one of my presets at WFC1. damn you wotl, why do you always have to take preset-names so literally?! ;) :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to your presets: 'Viscous' really made me :eek:! That one is sooo stylish!<br />
<br />
However, this pack has been pretty well done by everyone (not to forget all the other remixers!) :up:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">beeferoni</div><div class="date small text-muted">12th July 2005, 20:10</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I didn't expect you to include all 6 of my remixes Mr_N; I figured you'd just pick the best. I'm not complaining, believe me. I am glad just to have participated. This is a good pack, I think the overall quality might be better if 2 or 3 of mine had been left out. But Nicely done, and thanks for letting me in on this, I actually learned a thing or two remixing your presets. :up::)</div></div><hr />

why do you always have to take preset-names so literally?! ;) :p1) Because I suck at normal remixing.<br />
2)I had the (primitive) render object still laying around to be used (I have a lot of unfinished crap laying around ;))<br />
<br />
Edit: sorry about the doublepost on dA, connection was b0rked. dA connections are always difficult for me nowadays.<br />
I guess there's too much animeponies art there</div></div><hr />
