		Aah, what a fine and tempting opportunity this would be to leave the AVS scene with style... *sigh*<br />
But im not leaving, i still have a couple of ideas for a couple of packs i want to do... after that if i don't get any inspiration or i don't advance somehow i won't be doing presets anymore... most likely, but hey, life is so random that anything can happen and i might have to eat my words afterwards for saying these things :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, for now at this very moment im not even planning a new pack. But this does not mean im leaving AVS :)
