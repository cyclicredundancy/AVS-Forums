<div class="posttext">Pretty nice beginner AVS...fairly original, and entertaining (as opposed to many n00b AVS packs).<br />
<br />
However, you should always, always, *always* credit people if you're using their code.  I'm pretty sure I saw several instances of code-ripping (taking other people's code, using it in your own preset, and not giving them credit for it).  Just something to remember :) (Note how I'm not going all Kunf Gu you - you're lucky.  It's only because you're a good AVSer, and I don't feel you can be discarded so easily.  Be thankful ;) )</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Never once did I steal code, I analysed code used by others and changed it. I NEVER SLAVISHLY copied and pasted code into my AVSs. I borrowed examples from others and customised them as a basis for learning the variables. I am not good at maths, And I have little idea of the variables. On a lighter note, I thank you for your praise, and not kung Fuing me. :p <br />
<br />
By the way, In one of Duo's AVS, he uses the same code as in one of El-Vis's.<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you're talking about 3D code, that's *extremely* widely used.  Duo optimizes a lot of what he does, I doubt he'd use El-Vis's 3D engine (it's fairly slow).  Even if he did, I doubt Duo's ever used someone else's code without crediting them.<br />
<br />
My point is, if you take someone's code and you use it, edited or not, it's still their code and you still have to credit them.</div></div><hr />
