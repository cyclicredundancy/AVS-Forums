			<strong>Fireworks Preset</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		I decided to make a preset that looks like fireworks. So I tried and got this preset. It doesn't look exactly like fireworks but I think it still looks OK. You will need Unconed's Texer APE to watch this preset.

		Man, for someone who creates some of the most mathematically advanced presets I'd have thought you'd known.  Google for it, see what comes up.

		yes, yes in fact i do :D<br />
<br />

		Hey, not bad Ishan.  Except I'm not really liking the text too much.  And the scopes are a little too fast....like in real fireworks, they explode fast, and then slow way down, and fade out.  This preset would look great if those adjustments could be made, although I can't really help you there....

		Atero: I don't really see what you would spread with a gaussian distribution.<br />
<br />
In the 3D case, the spread across in all directions should be equal, but in the 2D case this is a projection of a uniform sphere, so it would be more dense at the sides.<br />
<br />
Probably only the individual particle speed should vary a bit (and then gaussian) but I thought the whole point of professional fireworks was to avoid this.

		umm, no?  since when is it supposed to be a projection of a 3d sphere...?  i rarely do actual 3d anyhow :)<br />
and the spread should be equal in every direction but not necessarily uniform in any one direction.
