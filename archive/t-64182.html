      For my up coming AVS pack, I need help with one of them. It is basicly a "simple" that flys, but its a superscope. I like it the way it is, except one thing. That is when it turns, sometimes it turns so much that it only looks like a line. The is what it looks like:<br />

      I was wondering if someone could change it so it either is thicker, or that it dosn't turn so much. If you want to see how I did it, it is attached to this. You can change it as much as you want, or even make a new one. I will give credit to whoever helped me. ;) Thanks a lot!:D</p>
