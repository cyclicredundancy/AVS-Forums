			<strong>help with scopes</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm making a rotating cube using one superscope per side.  I created the sides but the visualation leaks through so the rear plains can be seen, visually distorting the cube shape. I messed with the set render mode a little and a bunch of other stuff.  I want to make the cube solid and not transpartent, and I'm clueless.  Please help me.

		I think it'll help if you change the color depending on what phase of the rotation each scope is at. I assume you're using a cosine/sine of a certain variable to rotate each side; therefore, use the same sine or cosine (or combo, dependant on how complicated your rotation) of the variable to effect the color.<br />
<br />
   Assuming t is the variable, and it's looping between 0 and 2*pi:<br />
<br />
   red=if(below(sin(t),0),1,0);<br />
<br />
   This will make the scope red if the sin(t) is between 0 and -1, and black when it's 0 to 1. If your rotating is complicated, you will need to find a way to find when (during the loop of t) a scope is &quot;behind&quot; another plane; though, it will always be a certain part of the loop.<br />
<br />
   I think you will have to use an additive set render mode, so that when drawing a black scope (therefore &quot;unseen&quot;), it does not overlap any other scopes.<br />
<br />
   Unfortunately, this is not complete. The entire area of the scope will be switching between red and black, rather than just part of the scope which is supposed to be &quot;seen&quot;. I do not do much 3d in AVS, but I know you will need to use the variable i in the &quot;red=&quot; command. Maybe this problem will not even arise... I hope this helps a bit.

		To do actual solid 3D superscopes, you need to dynamically colour the lines white or black using a smart situation-dependant culling algorithm. A general solution is (imo) not possible in AVS. I have been able to get Z-buffered 3D scopes, in which each object has different colours (so it's not just a simple maximum filter), but it's slow as hell. Another method is to use a formula that fits the scene you have (e.g. my preset Groovy Saturn in Whacko AVS II).<br />
<br />
However in your case, there's a *much* easier solution. To realise this, just take a die or something else that's cube-shaped. From any angle, you'll never see more than 3 sides of a cube. In some cases, you can even see just two or one. So you just make 3 superscopes that contain a set of synchronized angles, and wrap these angles so that they're always between -pi/2 and pi/2. If you pick the 3 superscopes so that no 2 form opposite sides of the cube, you'll get the illusion of a cube: when a face 'disappears' by rotating left, it just reappears as the opposite face on the right-hand side.

		Thanks alot guys.  What I did was just use 27 (twenty-seven) superscopes for three sides of the cube.  What I'm trying to do is simulate a rotating Rubik's cube.  I made three superscopes be the center pieces for the viewable cube then remapped the 8 outer &quot;cublets&quot; to match the centers.  As for getting it to fully rotate, (simulating 3d), my math skills are weak.  As for the colors, I was trying to create the color to move very similar to the twisting of edges of a Rubik's cube, which I am completely lost on, maybe some kind of DM or just more math in the superscopes.  Thanks again.
