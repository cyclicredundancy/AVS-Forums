      <p class="post-content"><strong>pre-preliminary ultra prototype working model blues...</strong><br />
      Ya know, it's funny. When I first started (like 3 weeks ago) I could not wait to release a pack on the unsuspecting public. The farther I go the more I realize that I am nowhere near ready for that eventuality. Can someone evaluate these and tell me where my strengths (If there ARE any) lie, and where my many weaknesses lie so I can concentrate on those areas? I am starting to figure out that most of the skill just comes with practice. Boy do I need practice.:( :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Thanks everyone.</p>

      <p class="post-content">mix it up with color maps and modification, eh? Everytime I made another I had the feeling I was using the same 3 colors, I don't know why I didn't try and mix it up more often. Thanks (again) hboy</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just as hboy said, the "usual first presets". (but i've seen first presets beeing much worse).<br />
      <br />
      On idea about that red green blue problem: perhaps try it with color-shades. I mean when you have red green and blue in your preset and add a channel shift, you won't see a big change. red becomes green, green becomes blue and blue becomes red. If you have different tints you get some more versatility.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You guys really are helpful. Thank you so much.I just stumbled across a thing or two today that have already improved my subjective view of my work. Remember, ^..^ How we were talking about the 'unknown' presets? Well there were also a bunch of APEs in there (the windows system files) that I didn't have access to! Adds a hell of a lot more possibilities! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah, of course. I guess many of the newest presets wouldn't even be possible without certain apes.<br />
      btw i'm still wondering why you had avs files in your win-system folders!? :confused: Must have been a VERY broken instaler or something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think so. All the installers for any packs I have were either Pimpbot or winamp NIFS or whatever the hell its called. I think it's either A: My computer recently contracted a virus (don't worry no one is in danger!) That auto installs malware and adware all over my comp in bundles that are disguised as system files (i.e., .dll, .cab or system executables), so possibly it had something to do with it, or B: I put them in there by mistake, which I can't imagine; I'm fairly well versed in file protocall.;)</p>
