<div class="posttext">Ya know, it's funny. When I first started (like 3 weeks ago) I could not wait to release a pack on the unsuspecting public. The farther I go the more I realize that I am nowhere near ready for that eventuality. Can someone evaluate these and tell me where my strengths (If there ARE any) lie, and where my many weaknesses lie so I can concentrate on those areas? I am starting to figure out that most of the skill just comes with practice. Boy do I need practice.:( :igor: <br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the usual first pack :) the biggest problem is always the colour sheme: red, green and blue. try something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">mix it up with color maps and modification, eh? Everytime I made another I had the feeling I was using the same 3 colors, I don't know why I didn't try and mix it up more often. Thanks (again) hboy</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just as hboy said, the &quot;usual first presets&quot;. (but i've seen first presets beeing much worse).<br />
<br />
On idea about that red green blue problem: perhaps try it with color-shades. I mean when you have red green and blue in your preset and add a channel shift, you won't see a big change. red becomes green, green becomes blue and blue becomes red. If you have different tints you get some more versatility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You guys really are helpful. Thank you so much.I just stumbled across a thing or two today that have already improved my  subjective view of my work. Remember, ^..^ How we were talking about the 'unknown' presets? Well there were also a bunch of APEs in there (the windows system files) that I didn't have access to! Adds a hell of a lot more possibilities! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th March 2005, 22:23</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah, of course. I guess many of the newest presets wouldn't even be possible without certain apes.<br />
btw i'm still wondering why you had avs files in your win-system folders!? :confused: Must have been a VERY broken instaler or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't think so. All the installers for any packs I have were either Pimpbot or winamp NIFS or whatever the hell its called. I think it's either  A: My computer recently contracted a virus (don't worry no one is in danger!) That auto installs malware and adware all over my comp in bundles that are disguised as system files (i.e., .dll, .cab or system executables), so possibly it had something to do with it, or B: I put them in there by mistake, which I can't imagine; I'm fairly well versed in file protocall.;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">why not try to kindly inform them that they made a mistake? Do you think that they wont care then, or why must it be that nasty?</div></div><hr />
