<div class="posttext">I love AVS- it rocks- we use it for our bandvisuals -it beats the hell out of dragging around a lighting setup-<br />
That said- I would love to see a program<br />
that combined the flexibilty of AVS<br />
with the .avi capibilities of Arkaos-<br />
<br />
Arkaos is not so good with the real time<br />
abstract beat synced visuals- where AVS is great-<br />
and AVS will not play some .avi files-<br />
especially long ones.<br />
<br />
The Picture II mod allows for jpeg import,<br />
but often AVS tweaks bitmaps and jpegs<br />
in odd ways-  <br />
<br />
Like I said, AVS is great, especially for as<br />
freeware, but i would love to see is a program that- allowed a combination <br />
of these two-  <br />

<div class="posttext">Why do you want avi's anyways?  Avi's are not music reponsive and don't change every play.  <br />
<br />
Interesting idea.<br />
<br />
This belongs in the wishlist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Try some of the other AVI players. Check the APE list here (http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=90097).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hungry,<br />
We're using AVI's as videos for specific<br />
songs-  sometimes building flash movies, saving them as avi's and playing them through AVS, sometimes using static or looped movie clips and playing them through AVS.<br />
<br />
I'll look through the APE list.<br />
Any rec's on good APES to<br />
put AVI's through AVS-<br />
or should we use another format?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the links,<br />

<div class="posttext">How much actual AVS are you using for effects? Or do you just want to use AVS to run your AVI's through, if so use a different program it will run faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">We are using AVS a good bit-<br />
our av guy uses AVS in realtime<br />
and then dumps AVI files in for specific<br />
songs/events...<br />
<br />
AVS is running from a aux send from the mixer and is set to receive Line in audio.<br />
We can have AVS presets mapped to<br />
qwerty keys and trigger them for specific<br />
songs..  The AVI's are often semi-transparent and float on top of the <br />
AVS preset.<br />
<br />
Do you have any recs for AVI player APES, I can't seem to find any.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time,<br />

<div class="posttext">You are asking artists permission to use them right? Or do you only run your own presets?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Deamon,<br />
The idea is that we build them realtime, otherwise we'd just capture them with AVS<br />
capture and port them over to Arkaos...<br />
and we'd have no need for AVS....</div></div><hr />

<br />
what a pile of bullshit. if you don't want your presets being used, don't publish them, or limit the usage with some nazi-license.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah I'm agreeing with Yathosho here.  If you dont want people to use them then dont publish them at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I disagree with Yathosho and UIUC85 here.<br />
<br />
I publish my vis stuff for home non-commerical use. That I am cool with I think we all are otherwise we would not publish but otehr people use our work and pass it of as there own and get paid for it. That is wrong.<br />
<br />
If someone asks me then no real problem but when people use them in a commerical enviornment be that band visuals where people pay a fee (I could be agrued that even when not charging a fee as the VJ/company is using your stuff to get a established name and where a paying job is done free) to you vis used on a TV advert. They are all commerical use. Sadly.<br />
<br />
Sadly I have had people use my stuff passed of as there own and got paid for it when I should have got the gig. It may not happen to you but to me it is teh same if not worse then someone rebulishing your pack for free on da or winamp.com. You would be up in arms then no doubt.<br />
<br />
Hence the 'Nazi' license (I am about as much as a NAzi as outr own Neo-Nazi Virus Writer here - Steve) I add.<br />
<br />
Just because you publish a vis does not give people rights to use it as they choose.<br />
<br />
I expected a more informed viewpoint from you Yathosho given your vis moderator status on DA. Is that there policy  pray say it is not?!<br />
<br />
I don't create stuff so other people can make money from them. I not get your logic. Folks</div></div><hr />

nothing wrong with that. most avs people don't include license text or even contact-information, so they can't complain when their stuff gets used. i got a bit angry, that people worry about their presets being used, rather than being happy about this.<br />
<br />
hey, the average avs artist is 14 years old, are they contractually capable? :p<br />

i understand that feeling, but you have zero control on that.<br />
<br />
then again, there's this pirate-feeling in the whole vj-scene. things get ripped from all kinds of media, as it became popular among musicians to sample other people's work. as for my visualizations, i don't mind if people take/rip/modify any part of the stuff i made, that collides with my ideas on property. i don't do visuals to earn my bred, but for fun. respectable people will credit you anyway, the others are simply assholes, so why should i bother about these black sheeps?<br />

<div class="posttext">Speaking of ethics...<br />
Does anyone credit the AVS coders when they use AVS at a paying gig?<br />
(especially since it is freeware?)<br />
<br />
Now, back to the original thread...<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas on finding better .aviplayers for AVS- or should I try a different format? or different software?<br />

*sigh* anything you create you have rights to it by default. If you want to opt out of your rights then you can do but for my mind everyone that creates and publish stuff here on the forums and winamp.com has those rights as default.<br />

I understand the lack of control but for you to spread disinformation and promote this practice and whoever doesn't want otherwise is running Nazi views. Like I said I expected better from a DA representive.</div></div><hr />
