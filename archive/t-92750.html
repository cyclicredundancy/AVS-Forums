      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Wishlist</strong><br />
      AVS works just fine with Overlays on the desktop (atleast for me), but here's the large problem that nobody (that I've seen) has really addressed.<br />
      <br />
      To get rid of the AVS window (which has to be costing cpu time to draw along with the Overlay), could the Overlay setup have a "Hide AVS window when using overlay". This way, we can see our great skin and our AVS on our desktop (and see it once). We can easily stop/start AVS, and have been able to from the menu from WinAMP for quite a long time, so why force the window when we want to use the Overlay.<br />
      <br />
      A little more control over AVS randomization (and when it does it), limiting it to just ??? seconds rather than say, ??? beats, after each song, at a signal drop (silence or close to it, perhaps with a limiter). A command in the language that says, "Swap" to toss itself out and another (randomed) AVS to come into play, so people who make AVS sets can says, swap local, to tell it to swap within that folder only.<br />
      <br />
      A FPS limiter, since I've seen 60+ fps when it really doesn't need to be (like I can see all 60 per second), 30fps is enough for anyone to see, so why hog the cpu for it, when we can get more sound out and cut down on unnecessary sound stalls when we minimize/switch programs (with AVS on overlay, this happens as it has to wait to draw and sound stalls occur most noticably when task bar is raised or lowered, AVS overlay stops).<br />
      <br />
      Smarter randomizer with a "Do It Once" option, where it won't repeat until the entire list has gone once. (Current randomizer likes to pic favorites. [2.80])<br />
      <br />
      Anyone have any suggestions on these?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Overlay mode</strong><br />
      The resolution for overlay mode depends on the size of the AVS render window. With overlay mode on, AVS just takes the stuff that's sent to the render window and slaps it onto the overlay (with appropriate stretching to fit). Tyr it, shrink you AVS window to something rediculous. The overlay picture will be fast, but it'll look like crap. Being able to close the window won't affect the speed of AVS.</p>
