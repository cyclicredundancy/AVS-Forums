      I'm probably stupid for this but i just finished reading Pak-9's Tutorial, and then i looked at jaaks cube preset, then looked at pak-9's tutorial (doing this process ehh 7 or 8 times), im trying to figure out what he's done, he's got like 8 superscopes, and a few misc comments... not helping me at all...</p>

        jaaks cube preset
      </blockquote>and im trying to figure out what he's doing with the cube, (please dont tell me nobody knows? or otherwise lol) 1st superscope i think he declared values for the reg00(etc) with rotation ones? then started making the cube however he knows...!

      <p class="post-content">It easy to understand.<br />
      <br />
      The first scope is his global variables.<br />
      The second scope draws the shape by point-to-point scoping of each cube, then mapping them to a center.<br />
      <br />
      And... nobody knows</p>

      <p class="post-content">btw why is it advantageous to calculate some variables in a sperate scope? Can't it be done with the same one?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The advantage of having a global variable scope is to keep things in your preset synchrnoized; like rotation, colors, position...etc. This is used now to replace the old way of synchronization, combined getosc() onbeat, because it is nicer and works better for most applications.<br />
      <br />
      //added<br />
      It also will suposedly make a fps increase because there is nothing being calculated per-pixel in the scope or something like that. I don't know if that is true or not.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The main reason for putting rotations etc... in a seperate scope is cleanliness. With just one scope/texer2/dm etc.. It is actually sligtly more efficient to put everything in the scope that renders because you aren't writing to and reading from registers which is essentially a superflous operation.<br />
      <br />
      In a complex preset though, where more than one ssc/texer2/dm etc.. needs to be syncronised or in any way use the same values you are going to have to put the values in registers anyway so you might as well do it in a seperate scope for easy access and tidyness.</p>

      <p class="post-content">so that is just has got more style...<br />
      tss tss. nowadays they aren't satisfied with cool looking presets. No no. Also the code has to be arranged in a stylish way. Where does this end?</p>

      <p class="post-content">if the preset contains an insane amount of code, no one will be able to handle it. commenting does indeed help, but multiple scopes are even better :) and no Matt we are neither of those, we are just sexah!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">perhaps you should accept mysterious_w's help (he offered in another thread, right?), before he changes his mind ;)<br />
      I think the general idea of this preset has already been explained here.<br />
      But if you're looking for some more detailed information about the differnet "techniques"... you should utter a concrete question like: "How did jaak manage to render the cube?" Then you will surely get an satisfying answer like: "He used a point-per-point scope, ... bla bla bla." I would give a more detailed answer, but i'm also doing my first steps on this kind of stuff.. :(</p>
