      <p class="post-content">pretty good i think, but it could possibly use a little more movement, and the fps could be a tiny bit better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that's really cool, love it. the only thing i would do to it is modify the scope's rotation so it doesn't get too close to the screen, right now when that happens the line width does some ugly stuff. other than that, it's amazing, great work :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">atm i'm rewriting the iterator to make it 1pass instead of 3 pass :) that's gonna be quite a bit faster... also, i'm going to precache the coordinates in the gmegabuf instead of the turtle commands. that will take up more gmegabuf space but that doesnt matter since a 500,000 point SSC isn't running fluently anyway :)<br />
      it will improve the performance though :)<br />
      in that coordinate precaching algorithm i'm gonna determine the "center of masses" of the whole curve and let it rotate around that instead of some crappy none-centered point as it is now :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Rewrite is done here is the result :)<br />
      It has about 5 fps more for me and is also more nicely centered :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is probably the best fractal AVS preset I've ever seen. I looks very bumpy-3d-ish.<br />
      BTW: I can read this mini message though I'm not very close to the screen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well. After looking at this, I feel a little bit ridiculous with my Julia fractal :(<br />
      Very good work TomyLobo !<br />
      <br />
      BTW, you wrote 26 fps somewhere. Is this the speed on your computer ? It runs only at 9 fps for me ... (Pentium III 933 MHz)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The difference can also be in the display parameters (wait for retrace and the others).<br />
      I have also noticed that reducing the Winamp window (into a single bar) can improve the fps ...</p>

      <p class="post-content">you mean windowshade mode? hmm could possibly be if you use modern skins.<br />
      modern skins drain a lot of cpu power<br />
      <br />
      same counts for hungryskull :)<br />
      <br />
      another possibility would be differences in RAM speed/quality and mainboard quality<br />
      or simply resource-hogging background apps :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">if you just see a green line then you are probably missing the newest winamp/avs version<br />
      current is <a href="http://download.nullsoft.com/winamp/client/winamp503_full.exe" target="_blank">winamp 5.03</a> and avs 2.81b<br />
      it supports arrays, which i use a lot in that preset :) (coordinate storage, cloud diffusion)<br />
      here's the devart link for it, which includes a screenshot on which you see what you're missing ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">I know this probably wont make any sense and will just make people yell at me, but still...<br />
      Can anyone give me a link to some place where I can download the most up-to-date vis_avs.dll (cant download the whole winapm 5.03 - VERY bad connection here and horrible connection speed), because I cant see anything except a blue line. My avs version is 2.80.<br />
