      <p class="post-content">yes i am, and no im not..<br />
      (ohh, confusing)<br />
      i am axer, but im not indian.. im very much australian.<br />
      <br />
      siddhartha is originally a tibetan name, no doubt it is used all over the eastern world. It is also a book by Herman Hesse that you all should read, though it has nothing to do with avs.<br />
      <br />
      can anyone help me out with that texturing.. i can think of what it should be, but when i code it it doesnt work.. very frustrating.</p>

      <p class="post-content">bloody hell, i said ignore this thread everyone..<br />
      1: the image doesnt matter, use any friken image..<br />
      2: the sphere code is right, the texturing was wrong. Thats why it looked weird. but its fixed now, dont worry.<br />
      <br />
      but.. just to keep the prols happy, here's some meat.</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh.. if there are any weird variables or lines that dont do anything, its cause it started as something different.<br />
      <br />
      but by buhjeebus, does it really matter whether its coded as a sphere if it looks like a sphere? i mean, do people look at a preset and judge it by the code. do they hope that code will jump around the screen to the music? if so, ive been going about this the wrong way all along. Also the aspect ratio thnigamy wasnt fixed when i posted that (i think)<br />
      <br />
      edit/ i looked at mr.Acko's post again and realised that *sp*ct r*t** means aspect ratio.. very cryptic...<br />
      :igor:<br />
      <br />
      edit2/ the sphere code specifically was based on unconeds raytracing explaination in a thread here a while back, only slight adjustments have been made to those parts of the code. the camera angle code was from someone elses code (probably his again, but i cant remember) it uses clever atan2 stuff to make the camera always look at a point. (0,0,0) in this case.</p>
