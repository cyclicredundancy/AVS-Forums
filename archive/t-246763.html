<div class="posttext">If someone posts example code in this forum, for example ...<br />
<br />
EXAMPLE SUPERSCOPE --<br />
<br />
code start:---------------------------------<br />
Per Frame: ....<br />
Per Point: ....<br />
code end:-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Is it ok to use this example code in my presets without asking permission or giving credit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Generally speaking: yes<br />
<br />
Unless people say explicitly that you may not, or that it was taken from a preset.<br />
<br />
If you want to be particularily careful just credit the originator in the preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I used the keyboard\mouse control code from tip n tricks made by fragmer for effect lists in my painter preset.<br />
the codes were his and as stated by PAK-9. i did not require a comment but i still gave credit to him.<br />
trust me, it took me about 1 hr to figure out how the if(valtrue,valfalse) function worked and thats how i made the texer and scope disappear. but the on\off effect code was fragmers. i felt that he needed some credit for his assistance in my creation. on a further note i must know what did you think of painter? i know javs loved it.</div></div><hr />

Regarding forum examples, i've seen numerous times, one member will ask how to do something, and another member will give an example, saying &quot;hope this helps&quot; or something similar. Usually nothing is said whether others may or may not use it. And i just wondered what was the proper protocol for using these examples.<br />
<br />
My opinion, if it's used without modifications, then it's probably best to give credit, but if it's heavily modified, i think not.</div></div><hr />

Not a good idea. if you modify thats ok. but if its someones code then atleast do the decent thing and give credit for the help of posting the code. that way they don't think, oh theres another of my codes i handed out with no thanks to boot. trust me man. even the smallest of code should be commented. it at least the right thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No matter how deeply the code would be nested into your own, it's still someone else's code.<br />
<br />
Always give credit.</div></div><hr />

If it something trivial like drawing a circle or working out an aspect ratio... don't bother, its just annoying. I am sick of people who want to be credited for trivial things, and all the varying credits for such. When it matters is when you steal a preset defining effect, e.g. Raytraced DM, elaborate 3d model, complicated superscope etc...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Good points. I'm confused by threads such as the Tips &amp; Tricks threads. <br />
<br />
What is the purpose of these types of threads? Do the guys that post these tips and trick expect credit from anyone using them?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">good example of the raytracing and junk was the sets of dms that shreyas gave out. those deserve the credit. even tho i never got one of them to work :cry:</div></div><hr />

If you've seen something in the Tips &amp; Tricks thread, I would consider them to be public domain. They're usually things that you might even encounter or discover yourself through experimentation, so I should see no need for credit from such trivial lines of code.</div></div><hr />

I generally agree, except ..., there is some pretty advanced stuff there, not tips for beginners. :-)<br />
<br />
In the end, it's really a judjement call.</div></div><hr />
