<div class="posttext">Not done anything much lately, just learned a few new colour tricks and whatnot. Not working on anything complex until the new AVS is officially released. I messed about a bit with the simpler versions of 3d dm's. You can do some interesting stuff with the main shaping variable if you play about a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">It's done simpler and i have no idea how it all works, i just know generally what does what in it through messing.<br />
<br />
in the 'a' variable:<br />
<br />
max(z3,0) draws a plane on the z axis.<br />
max(z3,-z3) draws a plane on the z axis and on the negaticve z axis, (draws your basic two plane dm).<br />
<br />
so max(max(z3,-z3),max(x3,-x3)) would draw a tunnel. But it's the opposite of regular raytracing, max would draw all the planes as they are, but min would leave all the space out. Like with the above it would draw a large cross-like shape.<br />
<br />
then i just messed with the shapes i got through messing before from my morphing tunnel thing and with different axis, quite a few interesting results, although it does tend to cock up a bit if using all three axis for the same shape.<br />
<br />
Then there's just the simplified 3d to 2d projection and all the rotation hoosamafudge.</div></div><hr />
