<div class="posttext">Whats up, Im Dislusion. I just recently started making AVS's for winamp, useing winamp to make them. I have a few questions which actually be the same questions repeated...<br />
<br />
1)I was wondering if there was another better program to make them with. <br />
<br />
2 Is Winamp  better for making AVS's then Winamp 2? I am not useing Winamp 3, because theres no Jump Button. But i will if its better for AVS.<br />
<br />
3)Also, is this where we can just like share the AVS's what we made? or is it for like help reasons?<br />
<br />
:winamp: :winamp: :winamp:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1. Yes.  Pov-ray and Flash MX both export to AVS files.<br />
2. Yes.  Winamp is better than Winamp 2 or Winamp 3 for making your visualizations.<br />
3. No.  Posting AVS presets here will result in an imediate banning.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">m2k, that was seriously gay.  The guys new here - don't try to screw him over like that.  Sure he asked some questions that seem simple to us, but to new people to this those may be valid questions.<br />
<br />
1.  AVS presets are only made with Winamp's built-in AVS.  There are no other programs to make AVS.  Winamp's AVS is perfectly good enough and has everything you will probably need that is possible in AVS.<br />
<br />
2.  Winamp 3 and Winamp 2 both use the same basic AVS program.  Winamp 3 and the latest Winamp 2 both seem to be buggy every now and then do to some slight(but unnoticible) changes.  You don't NEED to change versions of WA(although WA 2 is better).  If you search these forums you can find the older versions of AVS(not wa) and write over your version.<br />
<br />
3.  Here and www.deviantart.com are the two main places to submit presets.  If you post them in these forums before submitting them to the main winamp site or DA then we can give you criticism which you can use to try to fine touch your presets before you submit them to the general public.<br />
<br />
About m2k - he is usually helpful.  He may be in a bad mood.(??)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">To m2k : <br />
<br />
1. POV-Ray export for pictures, nothing else.<br />
2. If winamp is less system-hungry than winamp2, then I don't mind.<br />
3. Posting AVS presets here repeatedly (and pointlessly) will get you banned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Anubis, stfu, he deserved it.  I'll tell you this one more time: pull the tree stump out of your ass.  And, as you know, that's a lot coming from me.<br />
Nic...we can only hope on that last point :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">pull it out of MY ass?  You're the one sitting there acting like you are so much better than him.  What you did does not help at all and just bashes him for not knowing this stuff.<br />
<br />
He wouldn't have asked the questions if he knew the answers.  Don't try to screw him up - then people will just get pissed and we'll have a little flame war.</div></div><hr />
