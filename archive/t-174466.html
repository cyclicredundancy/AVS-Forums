      <p class="post-content"><strong>Got bored</strong><br />
      Yeah, me too.<br />
      <br />
      Missed you all, but I'm glad to be back.<br />
      And the past week I got bored so I created something I had in my mind for a long time... a dancing R2-D2!!!<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, that's crazy I know it... :igor:<br />
      <br />
      The background still needs some work, but I thought, well, let's submit something...<br />
      <br />
      Now just enjoy it.<br />

      Great work, R2-D2 looks great, but as you said, the background could be better although it isn't bad now just needs one more thing to add to it... don't know what it is though :blah:<br />
      <br />
      Nice to have you back :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I actually meant being back after the forum-breakdown...<br />
      <br />
      I'm already working on another BG<br />
      <br />
      The difficult part on R2 was to reduce it's movement alsong the x-axis, I didn't want it to spin all around, but at a maximum of 15 degrees. I solved it not by changing sx and cx,(messes everything up,) but by putting a sine onto rx. The movement is kinda static now, but I couldn't find another way...</p>

      <p class="post-content">what about the ping-pong-formula<br />
      newrot=asin(sin(rot/maxrot/2*$pi))/$pi*2*maxrot<br />
      <br />
      this keeps the rotation between +maxrot and -maxrot</p>
