      <p class="post-content"><strong>My First Preset "Rotated Polar Rose"</strong><br />
      This's my first posted preset. Until now the best preset I've made. I started making presets for two weeks.<br />
      <br />
      Actually, I'm looking for a way to improve the way how to make presets.<br />
      <br />
      I don't really know how to use beats and motion of color to have attractive preset.<br />
      <br />
      I only know how to use mathematical function and put it in the superscope.<br />
      <br />
      I enjoyed the way how I made the polar rose to rotate.<br />
      I hope you'll enjoy it too.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Improved First Preset</strong><br />
      After few hours trying to understand how the beats works.<br />
      <br />
      I finally get it, now the preset looks amazing. I was surprised by the effect I made.<br />
      Now the Remixed Preset look more sophisticated and is also beautiful then the previous one, which it looks for me now as a primitiv preset.<br />
      <br />
      The only problem that I can handle it now is that it's to fast to look at it all the time. It's irritate my eyes.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone has an Idea to handle it.<br />
      <br />
      please repond.<br />
