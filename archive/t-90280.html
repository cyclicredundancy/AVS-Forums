      What factors determine the performance of AVS? processor speed? RAM speed/size? hard drive RPM? would it help to overclock? thanks for all your help!:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have come to the conclusion that you have no idea what you're talking about.<br />
      <br />
      I'm fairly sure there's no such thing as RAM speed, and the rest of the things you mentioned affect your whole computer, not just AVS. RAM size really shouldn't matter, because if your preset is large enough to take up all your RAM, your computer is going to crash - even if it gets close it's too damn big.<br />
      Also, the performance of AVS varies from preset to preset; more complex ones such as UnConeD's freaky-ass 3D stuff will be a lot slower than the default presets.<br />
      And lastly, of COURSE processor speed affects the performance of AVS!!! The processor speed determines (not affects, DETERMINES) the performance of your entire computer.</p>

      </blockquote>Actually if you wish to pick on someone be sure of the reason you are rude to them. There is a BIG difference now in memory timing. My DDR memory is clocked at 333 (2700), others vary in speed (look at the speed difference between RAMBUS and DDR for example). CAS latency also makes a big difference in how 'fast' your applications run. Also how your memory is handled makes a difference, people that own a motherboard with a VIA chipset can play around with 4way memory interleaving, a nice feature indeed!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>he's right</strong><br />
      There is such a thing as RAM speed. It's the speed that it can transfer information. Think about it: if processors keep getting faster and faster, if the old, slow RAM were used, wouldn't the processor's speed just be wasted waiting for the RAM to finish its work? He does know what he's talking about in terms that those things exist. To answer your question, hard drive RPM has fairly little to do with it (unless you have a 5-year-old hard drive with a 1-month-old CPU). What really determines how fast it goes is the CPU. If all the rest of your computer's components are about the same age, then they're properly matched. You probably know about component matching; but it all boils down to the CPU. If you've upgraded most of your components, but you have an ancient video card, for instance, that could be the "weak link" in your computer system. Hope that clears up some of the confusion<br />

      --A friendly greeting from C. Mountford.<br />
      Guys: Please! Please! Please!...Please review &amp; give opinions about my new presets by clicking on the link in my sig called AVS Preview Pack. Nobody's rated a lot of my new ones, given comments, made suggestions, or remixes. :( I don't care if you're a junior member. Opinions are opinions. All of them are welcome! :)--</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>note on overclocking</strong><br />
      Yes, overclocking would help. You'd better know what you're doing if you're going to overclock it. Most computer shops won't do it because they don't want to risk burning out your CPU. You'll have to add in extra-good cooling stuff (heatsinks, fans, etc.) all around the CPU. And only certain CPUs can be overclocked. You'll have to check to see if yours can be.</p>
