<div class="posttext">Take a look at the following two equation lines:<br />

r=cos(r*3); d=d*cos(d*1.1)<br />

r=cos(r*2); d=tan(d*1.05)<br />

Can you tell what is from what?<br />
<br />
I can.  Top is from ZenX's &quot;Rush&quot; and the bottom is from your preset...Change the numbers a bit and remove a variable, and Volia, new preset?  No.  I think this is a theft.  You may want to give some kind of credit to ZenX.<br />

<div class="posttext">Hey man, not bad. I prefer a bigger change on the beat though. Speaking of beats, your BPM customizer won't do anything at the end of the list like that. It only affects stuff below it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Xion: Do you realize how extremely common the r=cos(r*n) and d=tan(d*n) commands are?  If you called every preset since the first use of those commands theft, your preset collection would be 3/4 what it is right now.  Rush would probably be out too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Careful Xion. You've used those exact lines a few times before. :weird:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">yes I did use them but I gave some credit to zen...<br />
<br />
Okay maybe the lines are origional...but when I put the rush line in a movement above the preset...it looked extremely similar...but cooler.<br />
<br />
I take back any assumption of theft.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Xion: I used the same lines as well, and it was a very different preset.  First of all, r=cos(r*2) is a very different movement from r=cos(r*3), and d=tan(d*1.05) is very different code from d=d*cos(d*1.1).  Combined they make a completely different effect.  Don't judge a book by its cover. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm sorry if the lines look extremely similar, that's just really all the programming i can do. I did not take from ZenX's rush, but my simply knowledge of movement programming actually came from me observing Elvis-ZeroG, and seeing how that worked. You can see my first attempt at that programming in my 2nd preset &quot;PulsingSupernova&quot;. Anything new you are going to see from me is really going to be from me observing other visualizations and seeing how they tick, but i am not going to just take the code and call it my own. I know now that i shoulda given credit to Elvis's ZeroG preset for Pulsing Supernova, i'll do that if i ever package all my n00bish presets.<br />
<br />
To Xion: Remeber, if you ever see any likeness of my presets to others, it is NOT intentional. The avs community has brought out too many presets for every single once to look completely different, especially from n00bs who don't know programming well (like me). I've meddled with the SSCs before, but i don't have enough math knowledge to fully comprehend really wtf i'm doin. I'm just starting Algebra 2!<br />

<br />
:confused: ARRGGGH!!! Everything else effects the stuff above it! :mad: :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No it doesn't, it just affects the recycled frame...there's a diagram for this in the Effect List section of AVS Primer (yes, that's right, ANOTHER shameless plug)</div></div><hr />

can i just say something.. first up your attitude sucks, 1 in 2 of your posts that i read seem to be aggresive, secondly code that simple and basic can't really be accredited to anyone it takes about two seconds of experimentation to come up with either, thats why there are so many presets around that use similar or identical code without giving credit because sometimes people can come up with the same thing on their own...<br />
<br />
if i'm being too vicious i apologize, i'm having a really crappy day im currently on reformat number 7 and everything is still falling apart :cry: cant wait till i get my computer stable again<br />
<br />
-- i hate you bill gates, with every cell in my body :mad:<br />
<br />
btw i think that atero should put a link to avs primer on his sig, then it wouldn't need so much plugging, i think its a good idea (primer and the sig).</div></div><hr />
