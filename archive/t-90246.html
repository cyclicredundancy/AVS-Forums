		when I am using the AVS advanced visualization studio in full screen mode, the image does not actually take up the entire screen and the image is not even centered.  For some presets it is not a problem, but with others the image is cut off.  Is there a way to correct this problem?

		The only thing I can think it might be is resolution. Try a different one, see if it changes anything.

		thanks<br />
changing the resolution worked well.  Unfortunately, at that size the speed slows down a bit.  I'm thinking that I can't really improve that, I've got all the settings/preferences on for ideal speed, so I think it is just that I don't have a fast enough processor.

		Have you turned on pixel doubling? It essentially halfes the selected resolution.<br />
<br />
640x480 becomes 320x240<br />
800x600 becomes 400x300<br />
<br />
etc...

			<strong>oo</strong><br />
		
		

		I had the same problem, but first check the option in the fullscreen options window (in the AVS editor menu called settings), and see if the vertical height to render option is 100. I doubt you could have missed that, though.<br />
<br />
 The off-centering thing is likely due to the fact that your driver for your video card is either old, or not really correct for your card (like the generic driver that comes with windows). Open the display properties (right-click on desktop, select properties), and select the settings tab. Then click the advanced button, which will bring up another window.<br />
 You'll need to select the tab that has the hardware acceleration slider (it's named differently, dependant on what windows version you have). When I chose the no-acceleration setting, the fullscreen mode worked perfectly, as well as overlay mode.

			<strong>windows resolution</strong><br />
		
		

		If your windows resolution is anything more than 640 by 480, then it's slower.  I still use 800 by 600, even though it's slower, just because it makes you have waaaaay less desktop space.  But if you're planning on VJing &amp; have a laptop just for VJing, as long as you don't have too many icons, changing your Windows resolution to 640 by 480 can speed things up some.  If you match your Windows resolution to AVS resolution, it should take up the entire screen.  I hate to think what it'd be like if you had 1600 by 1200!

		You could try using overlay mode.
