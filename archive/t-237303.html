<div class="posttext">Hey, I've been making some major progress with AVS, but it is tremendously frustrating when I must keep re-doing everything I've done because winamp keeps crashing. It's only when I perform some sort of action, like arranging a superscope, or changing a rendering mode. This is driving me mad. Has anyone come across this problem?</div></div><hr />

This is well known and there's no other fix than frequent saving.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When coding do it all in notepad, then copy paste across to test.<br />
<br />
In my experience 99% of crashes seem to happen when code compiles. So I write some code, save my preset, paste it in... then if it crashes I can just load and do the paste again.<br />
<br />
Its easy to not follow tho :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've found that AVS seems to crash much less often if I edit while the visualization is &quot;docked&quot; in the AVS editor window. It still happens, of course, but less often... I think...<br />
<br />
I've used the Notepad trick, too, and it helps. Another major reason I like that is that I can maximize Notepad and edit my code using the full screen with word-wrapping.<br />
<br />
Of course, even with these hints in mind, AVS isn't completely stable, and never will be, so you should also get into the habit of saving frequently.</div></div><hr />

What an enticing imagination!<br />
But AVS would definitely lose a bit of it's excitement when you don't have to care of saving and you never have to fear that all your work will get lost all of a sudden! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Should not be a major problem to force AVS to save.<br />
The only new thing is the Save-File Dialog Box popping up.<br />
<br />
As I am thinking of this, its probably better to have an external agent running that will detect crashes and reload your preset in last state automatically too when AVS is restarted.<br />
<br />
The only problems would be a slowdown, depending on the saving rate and it might also be possible that the dialog box is taking some time to get the file information it needs and will force AVS to idle meanwhile. The first thing could be cutomized, but if the latter occurs, this would probably not make sense at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">but I could live with a short break every 5 minutes.<br />
I simply can't get myself to save frequently, I just forget it. even when I think &quot;now this is cool, almost finished&quot; I don't have the automatic reflex of saving...<br />
so this would really save me a lotta time<br />
<br />
[although it can't be denied that many of my good results came when I rebuilt sth deviously after a crash.]<br />

Not a few moments but should be ready after 2 hours, at least for me as i've the needed routines already done for Hotlist. If I've some time left beside my major projects, I'll give it a shot.<br />
Its really not that much of a big deal, all you need is a timer, and a row of commands to be sent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Why?<br />
<br />
Its even easier without the need to hack. Again, all you need is a timer and a call to the save procedure.<br />
<br />
But I dont think doing your custom AVS is so good.<br />
One should ask the dev group if one could contribute stuff to the official version instead. Otherwise there'd be a need to rewrite every new release your own, also there'd be finally some progress on AVS developement.</div></div><hr />

Why would it? Because it's closer-to-the-root programming, more basic?<br />

<br />
The lower level you program at the less stable the result is likely to be. If you coded AVS in Visual Basic it very rarely fall over (unless you used r33t h3x) but it would be crushingly slow (again, unless you used r33t h3x). <br />
<br />
If you coded it completely in assembly it would be excruciatingly difficult to track down any bugs and probably be going over all the time... it would be pretty nippy though.<br />
<br />
When its all said and done though, fixing (patching, bodging, whatever you want to call it) the existing AVS to a stable state would make a lot more sense than writing it from scratch... assuming all you want is the same functionality but stable. <br />
<br />
And by the way it would take about 5 minutes to add an autosave to AVS if you get the source and have a passing familiarity with C.</div></div><hr />
