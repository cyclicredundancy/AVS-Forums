<div class="posttext">Here's a rather whacked preset... I don't quite like how it turned out though, it was cooler in my head :p.<br />
<br />
Looks like he's drunk and about to pass out, instead of dancing happily, but hey, you can't have everything :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I think it's because his body looks like a bowling pin... you just expect something big to come along that'll knock him over. And then he won't be able to get up because of his fat body :p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Okay, maybe it's what they had me on in the emergency room, but I just can't stop laughing at him.  (don't worry-they said it was a really bad migrane; but we originally thought it was meningitis-for those of you who don't know:  meningitis can kill).<br />
<br />
I just can't stop giggling-My head's a little messed up by all that medicine probably :D :D :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">LOL that is hilarious! And impressive too.<br />

I just thought of something: I don't supose you can make something hit him in the head (which then bounces around like mad) occasionally? :D</div></div><hr />

It's not like I want to be ValentineDancer nr II (though adding 2 spherical appendiges near the front side wouldn't be too hard :p)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Awesome...I think you should try to get something to hit him once and a while...maybe a ball to come up and hit him, have him bounce back and forth for a bit and then stabalize</div></div><hr />

Now I am warning you. You have made your point (?) now pack it in or you will be banned for a couple of days to cool off. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">What the fuck do you have against UnConeD?  I would bet my college fund that you're the guy who's been doing trash reviews for all his packs, and did all the dumbass &quot;hacking&quot; on acko.net.<br />
I'd really like to know what the fuck is uip with you, but in any case, you're fighting a losing battle (if you can call it a battle - or even fighting).  Since it seems that everybody who's ever seen any of his presets disagrees with you, I think it'd be a good idea to fuck off before the fire hits your ass.<br />
<br />
*ahem* UnConeD, do you have any ex-girlfriends?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">*ahem* UnConeD, do you have any ex-girlfriends?<br />
<br />
LOL... But he did hack acko.net he merely exploited a flaw that wasnt even there... Since it didnt overun the buffers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Ex-GF's? None that would hate my guts :)<br />
<br />
Besides, thejby2k is giving me the best compliment: judging from his low post count, it seems he registered *just* for me! Awww.... isn't that sweet? :D<br />
<br />
And it seems he has quite a vivid imagination, judging from what he thinks Mister Happy is doing, aside from dancing. :p<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here's a much more improved Mister Happy...<br />
<br />
- his body is a shaped a bit better now (asymmetrical from front to back)<br />
- the arms, head and torso now each have several possible 'dance routines' that are randomly chosen (more variation)<br />
- the dancing is tuned to the music: no more music = no dancing<br />
- the camera angles are much better<br />
- there's dust falling down<br />
- more colour variation<br />
<br />
Comments appreciated :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 15:50</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Go Mr. Happy.:)<br />
<br />
He makes me laugh.:D<br />
<br />
What about making him fall backwards as well every so often?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 15:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The falling would be very hard and would add yet another rotation to each of the superscopes... and it would be very hard to get a realistic falling animation that doesn't look like crap except at one framerate (e.g. Jupiter or Lunar gravity).<br />
And falling is hard enough, so I doubt I could ever make a nice 'getting up' animation. Making him spring back like one of those eggs that always stands up wouldn't be very realistic either.<br />
<br />
Oh and I'll probably run out of variables soon again. Justin Frankel's expression library wasn't made for very complex code I think :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 16:13</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually I only meant fall or sway backwards a bit every so often so he looks even more drunk.:) Not actually over but that would be even better for him to do that.<br />
<br />
BTW how many variable do you get in AVS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">ryan</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 16:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Wouldnt it be the same as MD..? Since I though they use the same expression library... BTW NIce work again =)<br />
<br />
If I was smart enough to do this I wouldnt be called idiot....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 17:07</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well it's probably the same in Milkdrop and AVS (though they might be implemented a bit differently, I don't know), but the main problem is that components like the Superscope and Dynamic movement evaluate your code as you type it. So when you type:<br />
red=blue<br />
AVS will register the variables r, re, red and b, bl, blu, blue.<br />
<br />
The library doesn't remove unused variables (or AVS doesn't), so the only way to get rid of them is to save and reload your preset. I've also noticed that sometimes (when you already have a lot of variables) AVS won't register new ones. Again, the only fix is save/reload.<br />
<br />
Milkdrop doesn't have this problem because you have to hit CTRL-ENTER to apply your code (or at least it doesn't suffer from it as much). I don't think there's ever been a MD preset that hit the limit. In AVS though it's much easier, for example if you wish to store a point in a 3D superscope, you have to use 3 variables (x,y,z). It adds up easily.<br />
<br />
I guess you could try and see how many variables MD and AVS can take... you'll know you hit the limit when it crashes :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Rovastar</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2002, 18:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">:)<br />
<br />
MD is different to AVS the expression library is nothing to do with the variables.:)<br />
<br />
We do have a limit of about 30-40 variables and when writing presets sometimes we hit the limit.<br />
<br />
But the way MD works is that if you have gone over the limit those subsequent variables no matter what you have assigned to them are as null, well zero.<br />
<br />
AVS will register the variables r, re, red and b, bl, blu, blue <br />
<br />
Urrrgh that is truely horrible. :eek: :igor: :weird: :down: :eek:</div></div><hr />

BTW Rova heres what it says in Ryan's preset guide about this... <br />

<br />
....Following is a list of the functions supported by the expression evaluator.<br />
The list was blatently ripped from the help box of Justin Frankels' AVS <br />
plug-in, since MilkDrop uses the expression evaluator that he wrote.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Of course UnConeD would notice this when he first made the DM, and even some of the people in the forums might have discovered this, but I thought this was nifty all the same.<br />
<br />
I think it looks cool if you turn off the blend in the DM; then try turning off rectangular coordinates!  :)  Of course this isn't what it's supposed to look like, but it definitely changes the look of the preset.<br />
<br />
Another cool change:  in the first effect list, change the superscope to dots (instead of lines).<br />
<br />
I guess it would be too hard to make a bowling ball hit him in the head and make his head bounce around, huh?<br />
<br />
I've been at summer camp for a week, in case some of you didn't hear, so I'm a little behind on commenting on previous posts.<br />
<br />
YaPoNDeeZzZzz:  you know you could probably easily smudge or add in a tail in each individual frame quite easily to make it look a little more like an A.<br />
<br />
Some of you may have noticed my new avatar (the switch would have been a week or more ago), which I think turned out much better than my old one.  Much brighter colors-rotation bug fixed, etc.<br />
<br />
--A friendly greeting from C. Mountford.  :) Don't forget to check out my two *active* threads, because I've added some new presets in zip files that haven't been reviewed yet--</div></div><hr />
