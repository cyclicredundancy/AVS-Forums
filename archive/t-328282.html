<div class="posttext">So I just updated my Winamp to the recent 5.6 version and all of the sudden Convolution Filter stops working on AVS. It just sits there, you can punch in numbers, but it just doesn't do anything. I tried downgrading AVS to 2.81d as per this link http://forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=45403&amp;d=1240297801 and it went from bad to worse, now everything with convolution filter just downright crashes. Tried Cockos Happy AVS, nope doesn't work. Tried a few tips provided by Warrior of the Light about running winamp in different modes, but nope didn't work the best that happened was that it didn't crash anymore but convolution just refuses to do anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">heard a rumour that avs isn't working so well with 5.6 and i had some (infrequent) problems with convolution filter myself<br />
<br />
did a downgrade (http://www.oldapps.com/winamp.php?old_winamp=253) and things are good again</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks Yathosho, that did the trick.<br />
<br />
Let this be a lesson and never update Winamp if you want to keep on viewing AVS :P</div></div><hr />
