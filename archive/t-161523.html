Remember that the christmas holidays are the best hunting seasons for the monster we all call &quot;the real life&quot;, just hide in your room until it blows over, don't let it get to you!</div></div><hr />

I tried making something before starting this topic, but it didn't work out that well.<br />
<br />
@ nic01: lol, that sucks dude.<br />
<br />
I kinda like christmas. Delicious dinner with all the family (which I like), good times with my girlfriend, and so on. Come on! Enjoy the time. It's only once a year.</div></div><hr />

Note: christians are a minority on this forum and we like to stick to the topic, AVS. Your question was probably intended to be neutral, but it can hit a touchy nerve with some folks.<br />
<br />
Over here (Belgium) christmas is pretty unreligious anyway, depending on the family and age of those present. To me, reflexion and socialising have nothing to do with traditional religion, which, aside from the part about the guy-up-there, is little but a set of customs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wanted to make 3D snow but made some spooky looking random curvy thing :)<br />
<br />
Is this good enough to be christmas preset?;) My *first* 3D ever! Have Texer2 ready!:p<br />
<br />
[EDIT!!!]<br />
I made a 4D version of this preset :D<br />
It's zipped with the original.<br />
To see it 4D, stratch your avs windows to approx. 5:3 ratio, not very large (~17x10 cm) and click left-mouse-button. Now cross your eyes until the two dots become one in the center :). It may take a while, but than you'll see the the effect (thanks to y-rotation offset and binocular vision ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">27th December 2003, 07:52</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Firstly, it's not 4D, it's just stereoscopic 3D.<br />
Secondly, you don't get stereoscopic 3D just by shifting your 2 scopes left and right... you need to move them in 3D before projecting to 2D, in your case you need to add a small positive/negative offset to x3. Otherwise there is no difference in horizontal shift for different depths.<br />
And thirdly, unless you want to give people headaches, you won't make stereoscoping presets that change shape 30 times per second :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">grr.<br />
<br />
in case you didn't know, i'll tell you: i fucking hate it when people make &quot;little misunderstandings&quot; about multidimensional geometry.  especially when people call something 4d when it's fucking not.  i don't buy that &quot;but the fourth dimension is TIME!!1&quot; crap either, so shut the fuck up with that too.<br />
it's the same way i hate it when people call something hentai when it's not.  it's just a bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I wanted to edit the post but was too late. Sorry Atero, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings about hentai :) I know it's only 3D, but you know, I just made my first 3D scope in my life so I was kinda happy.<br />
<br />
@UCD: the y-rotation is (and was) shifted in 3D (10 degrees), don't worry. I updated the attachment yesturday about 1 minute before your post to remove the crazy shape changing (it was an accident ;))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sticking to the topic is no problem but when the topic is most definitely a religious one or one related to religion for that matter, i would like to speak about it! <br />
<br />
Christmas is Christianity and if anybody disagree's with that, then i really do hope you refrain from commenting!<br />
<br />
Question here is if AVS is the topic then why post Merry Christmas thread in this here sub-topic! <br />
<br />
But still it was meant with the greatest of intentions, daemon actually had the sense and decency in him to wish everyone here and i salute you for that daemon! <br />
<br />
My Atheist question was meant with no bad and nerve-striking intentions but was born out of curiosity! Please forgive me!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The topic of this thread is NOT AVS. It's a merry christmas to the AVS community. That's a difference. Damnit, it was meant good, and now people start fighting... in a fucking christmas wish topic! :mad:. What's wrong with some of you?<br />
<br />
Anyways, the way I look at it, your question isn't harmful in any way, Fishzn.<br />
<br />
As an anwser to it: I'm atheist, and I mostly do nothing on christmas day ;). I enjoy the christmas tree, watch some movies, visit friends and family, that sort of thing. It's just a friendly time together with everyone to me. And no fights with the people I don't like as much as others. I just skip the religious part, don't go to church etc.</div></div><hr />
