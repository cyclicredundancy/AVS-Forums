USE IT!!!<br />
<br />
the preset looks good, decent flow preset but don't use god damned moving particles anymore. Just read my moving particle in superscope explanation in accentmat's new guy here thread. It's a nice preset but the moving particle just drags down the quality.

		i like it :)<br />
<br />
you should make the flow vary a bit more though, it looks a bit repetitive, and i agree with raz, you should write a moving particle as you could get much cooler results :)<br />
<br />
nice preset though, im feelin the vanilla coke ;)

		Yes the moving particle does tend to stand out, and that weird edge at the bottom looks kind of ugly.... I think if you zoom in the screen more it will disappear.  Otherwise it's pretty cool.:up:

		I can think of one good use of MP's and that was in my unconed's water cube remix. Thats cause all i needed was a circle and it wasn't a major part of the preset. This however is glaring in your face mahor part. Why not go one better and make it a sphere :D

You're right. It seems that anyone who is on the forums a bit learns to not like n00b presets.

		That's because this is where you see noob presets. If a preset pack has only got 1 star you don't download it. That simple but here it's just people starting so we're responsible for guiding them and giving them help.

Unless you are a reviewer.  There are some crap packs out there.

		A bit too simple looking i agree and definetly needs a bit of a kick in the music response. And i would randomize those values in the dynamove rather than use 1+bt and btw. <b>R,D,X &amp; Y</b> values in the <b>frame</b> or <b>beat</b> section won't do anything. They are to be used in the <b>pixel</b> section.
