			<strong>First Post - multiphasic colour scope v4.0</strong><br />
		
		
			
		

		!WARNING! <br />
  This is not a proper normal AVS <br />
   that you can just run <br />
    and expect it to look nice!<br />
<br />
 Please don't download it <br />
  and complain that it looks crap <br />
   without reading the blurb.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Salutations All,<br />
While there are indeed many beautiful and excellent AVS jobs around, most visualisations look much the same regardless of what music is being played. Usually the beat detected is the only significant factor in effecting the visuals. And sometimes the trace of a superscope is used as a dynamic element. <br />
  However, in general AVS visualisations look the same (detected beat tempo aside) whether you play Mozart, Lyrics Born, or Nina Simone.<br />
<br />
So, i have been working on a spectroscope that does not have mega visuals, quality 3D code, or anything much in the way of funky artistic coolness; but, is sensitive to the sound of the music being played (a bit). <br />
<br />
The latest version is attached; “multiphasic colourscope v4.0.zip”<br />
  BUT it requires specific preferences settings to work properly (see below), <br />
  AND a setting on the superscope must be adjusted to match the volume level of the recording.<br />
<br />
Requires a fairly fast pc, 3D-card is not a factor.<br />
<br />
It is basically a single superscope, with a finely tuned set of simple colour algorithms, and then a bit of blur, etc.<br />
  It works best with simple arrangements like folk, classical, acoustic, ambient. And is rather lame with noisy stuff like thrash-metal, loud techno, or poor recordings.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Required Settings;<br />
  - avs settings &gt; display &gt; Wait for retrace [off]<br />
  - avs settings &gt; display &gt; Pixel doubling [on]<br />
  - window shape = tall and thin [i.e. drag the corner]<br />
<br />
Necessary &quot;per track&quot; adjustment to the superscope;<br />
  - render / superscope &gt; init &gt; mag=3<br />
    &quot;mag&quot; (as in magnitude) is the colour intensity, <br />
    adjust it such that there is little or no white.<br />
<br />
Full Screen;<br />
  to properly accommodate the change in window shape;<br />
  - init &gt; xdiv=4<br />
    change to xdiv=8, <br />
    and then &quot;mag&quot; may also need to be changed.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Try some diverse pieces of music and see the difference.<br />
<br />
Would be most interested in your comments etc, be not shy.<br />
