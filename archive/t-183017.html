      <p class="post-content"><strong>I quit</strong><br />
      I'm quitting AVS. Just can't figure out any of this stuff. And after about 2 years of trying, I'm definitely ready to give up. These new effects and new AVS styles are very unprecedented to me, I have no idea what they are, what they do, and I really just don't care enough to try and figure any of it out. I've gotten into photography (I'm the school's head photographer) and now I have lots of jobs to do with that (like yearbook) and I've made a few collages for people using photoshop, (for example, I made one in memory of a friend who died a couple weeks ago) and if you check out my deviantart page, you'll see that's pretty much all I'm doing right now. I just can't get into AVS anymore.<br />
      <br />
      Bye everybody<br />

      This is really starting to get to me. I think I'll quit as well, it's just not fun anymore. I'll try and finish my pack (only needs an intro), and I guess I'm gone after that as well. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reason why I am planning to quit is because, AVS is something I enjoy. But not something I am particularly good at. I don't know, some of you mayt have enjoyed my work, please tell me if you do, cause I like a boost.<br />
      But really, when I had that 6 month hiatus, I forgot about AVS, which for me was a totally unfinished book.<br />
      I still had an unfinished pack on my HD. I couldn't just quit then.<br />
      But I don't really want the responsibility in future. If it can be called one.<br />
      I don't need any more things to do.<br />
      I don't want the duty of making new AVSs, especially when I have reached my peak and I wonder how much more I can make without becoming a cheap and shitty version of myself.<br />
      I can't code, and I won't pretend I can.<br />
      And that's that. I won't ever know. I'm not smart enough.<br />
      All I like is the transe visuals, which is why I made AVS, with that in mind.<br />
      I hope people enjoyed my work in some way.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Why does everybody have the feeling of being forced to do new packs and having a responsibility? Just don't force yourself into that. I haven't released a pack since EyeCandy and that was ages ago!! just make a preset whenever you want to and when you feel you have enough stuff, make a pack out of it but don't force yourself into the thought of "oh my, I haven't published a whole perfect new pack this week, everybody must be looking at me right now" That's pure BULLSHIT!!! Don't expect yourself to be the best, it's NOT a race we're having here to become the best..<br />
      OK, we would all be just that, but it is not what AVS'ing is about... it's about loving to make crative new stuff that looks attractive, something you can do while listening to your favorite music and for all the other reasons you once started it. if everybody who feels that they might not be the best simply quits, there would be just one left and he would quit aswell simly because there won't be anyone left to enjoy his presets!!<br />
      Again, you HAVE no responsibility. no-one would ever blame you for not being the best or trying hard enough, we so this for our own fun! We're no professionals who have to live from it..<br />
      Not having ideas anymore is something you can get over with in a while.<br />
      This is what often helps me: just think of something that in your mind does not have any connenctions with AVS, and try if you can combine that. Helped me several times, it's no promise, just a little tool.<br />
      <br />
      Don't quit because you feel you can't do this, no-one here knows it all and we're all learning this in our <u>own</u> speed. Therefor don't have too high expectations of yourself. you're doing this at your own speed and that is ALWAYS enough.<br />
      <br />
      The power in AVS is that you have the freedom to do whatever you want, unbound. Don't EVER bind yourself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well for me to do AVS presets nowadays is because no one ever does the stuff <b>I</b> like! :p<br />
      Maybe my avsing started from something else, like community or having nothing else to do, but now i do it simply because i enjoy it or i want to make presets i would like to see...<br />

      That how much other people like your "taste" is indeed irrelevant.</p>

        <p class="post-content">i find it most amusing, that many teen avs'ers speak of quitting, as if they are going to retire from their life-long job. that also shows how serious these people take it - quitting is quite a cut. i mean, just pause as long as you feel like. it either catches you again or not.</p>

        Lot's of cool AVS can be made and you don't need to understand everything, so this ins't any problem at all.

        <p class="post-content">I don't do any public releases any more because I suck. :) I've been away for so long that I'm not cutting edge any more. I still play around with AVS and make stuff I really like to groove with. Losing all the stuff I produced in my prime (and all my little "utils") really, really hurt. If you value your AVS stuff and are reading this, back it up right now. Zip it and upload it to an Angelfire account. Burn it. Whatever, just get it saved somewhere. :)<br />
        <br />
        The biggest hurdle to getting to know AVS is in figuring the math out. You can do a lot of fun stuff without much math, but the really impressive stuff involves all sorts of the really ugly/math-heavy stuff, like quartic solvers, that bizarre inverse 3D transform for the DMs, and so on. On top of that, you need to be able to think creatively and results-orientatedly about that math. That was never my problem, I just forget most of the stuff I ran across once-upon-a-time.<br />
        <br />
        Anyhow, so long as you enjoy what you're making and you're having fun, never stop!</p>
