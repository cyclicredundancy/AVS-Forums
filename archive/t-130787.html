      The fireworks display near the lake inspired me to make this preset,<br />
      looks great in rectangular screens, e.g 192X600</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey those are really cool! Can't beat the zevensoft's fireworks in "realism" &amp; beauty, but they beat them in response 10:1! The beat detection of this whole preset is just amazing (for my music atleast ;))<br />
      <br />
      One thing though that bothers me a bit is that the fireworks sometimes don't get to fade out properly, but just disappear suddenly.<br />
      <br />
      Good work :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">That is an excellent preset in terms of comparison between looks and beat detection. Also it actually looks like fireworks and isn't buggy like the APE. It isn't exactly the most original idea though. Nice job but are you still going to make different types of fireworks?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, I am working on that..I may use a random generator for the fireworks, these are only 3d spheres. ;) (they dont look like spheres because of dot rendering )</p>

      The fireworks themselves need a little more randomization, but its nice.</p>

      </blockquote>Well, yes with a bit small numpoint number so that they dont look like shpheres, just remove the four scopes and set render as lines, you will see that they are spiral spheres :)

      Anyway, I'd make it fade out by setting for variable to one on beat, then multiplying by .98 each frame. Not that I've look at the code mind you.</p>

      </blockquote>no, u cant do that here, as the fireworks fire up once ever four beats. try changing the fadeout speed

      <p class="post-content">They explode too fast here... also you should definitely use a random gen, 'cos they're way too regular.<br />

      Add parabolic trajectories to this one and it'd be neat :)</p>
