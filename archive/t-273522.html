      </blockquote>The short answer is because they either want to do something that they could learn from a guide, or they want to do something that would require complicated coding techniques.<br />
      <br />
      Long answer involves the fact that avs has got to the point where people using it are either old hands or total noobs... a bad state to be in. Resulting primarily from lack of updates and promotion, [insert 'avs is dying' thread here]

      Although I hate to admit it, AVS is dead in my book.<br />
      <br />
      It's a shame, because there is still so much potential as an artform. But now I think back 5 years ago and it felt like the medium was building upon itself, growing exponentially.<br />
      <br />
      I'm curious if anyone else is experiencing what I'm going through. I still have visions in my head I would love to create, but I know the work involved would be just so much, I don't even bother.<br />
      <br />
      Plus, I'm tired with Winamp as a media player.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'd say they are both the wrong words. Since the wfc6 kickoff, there have been a lot more people stopping by the AVS forums.

      <p class="post-content">I get the feeling that most of the old squad are more interrested in progression than the presets themselves. We seem to want to do something as difficult as possible.

      Don't get me wrong, progression is a very good thing but I think that the progression came <i>in place of the visuals</i> at some point.<br />
      <br />
      I think that AVS could be very much alive if we would just make packs for the sake of making packs rather than to make packs to show progression again.<br />

      </blockquote>Agreed.<br />
      <br />
      Although I can't help but think the stagnation lies in the very core of the software, there was a limited amount of expansion that could be had simply from how AVS was designed to run to begin with. Now it sort of gives the impression that any updates would just be purely superficial on something that is essentially obsolete, but what we lack is something to obsolete it with.<br />
      <br />
      But, all that aside, it's still incredibly fun and addictive to play with.

      </blockquote>Damn straight.<br />
      <br />
      I don't really have the need to show progression in my presets, but I always like to learn new things, and I have higher standards set for my self for what's a preset and what's a bunch of random lines. I end up deleting my presets that I find boring; either that, or I set it asside for a month, then fix it up later.<br />
      <br />
      I would prolly have a pack by now if I didn't do that, but what's the point if it half of it doesn't look good?<br />
      <br />
      I guess you could compare the AVS community population to the baby boom. When AVS was newer and was being updated, a bunch of new people came in, did a whack of presets, and left, leaving a few others behind. Maybe a whole new version of Winamp is in order. People will check out the new version and actually start using winamp, and they might just happen to discover AVS. Hey, it happened to me.

      </blockquote>well put, but not even that <i>spirit</i> seems to be around anymore. once people get into it they end up doing the same cubes that bored me to death in 2002 already. that applies especially to the people that are more into coding than into the looks. there's still some new stuff out there, but it's not as competitive (in a good way) as back then.<br />
      <br />
      also nobody denied there's still a lot of avs in production. it's just not relevant more. the 20 people that still do avs are the same people that download it :p<br />
      <br />
      hence irrelevant!

      <p class="post-content">I agree basically with yath<br />
      <br />
      Often when people say avs is dead a few people come out and say "well I still use and enjoy avs therefore it is not dead". While you may still enjoy avs (and there is ofc nothing wrong with that) the main community as it used to be no longer exists, that is what people are referring to.</p>

      </blockquote>nothing is stopping you from making a standalone AVS as the source is available for it. as for the first part, different people have different needs and for some WMP is a better suited product (if all of our needs were the same then we'd all be using the same software whatever that would be called, heh)<br />
      <br />
      as for the state of the community, the same applies to a lot of different areas of winamp, not only avs presets but then that's just how things go especially considering that we're 10 years down the line from the player appearing and then the related side-projects, it's a surprise in all honesty that anything is still as it even is now. at the end of the day, everything has it's time, maybe AVS is in that stage or this could just be the lull before the storm, who can really say.<br />
      <br />
      it's ofcourse going to be harder to maintain an impetous with things especially those from the early days if they're<br />
      been there, done that and got the t-shirt and would explain some of the responses noobs get (though a lot of the time it's deserving since they've not tried to make the effort to find things out, etc in the first place) but then that's how things go with a lot of other similar situations.<br />

      <blockquote>

      <p class="post-content">its been a year and a bit since last made anything in AVS so i guess i can say its dead for me. but then again, about a week ago i laied on my bed and watched random presets projected on the ceiling of my room. damn, that brought back some nice memories. if only i wouldnt have gotten so drunk so many times when vjing id prolly sill be doing it but as it was i got banned from the last club that let me work about a year and a half ago and well...<br />
      <br />
      what really bums me out is the fact the Fridge newer really went anywhere. i mean i never found any good replacements for AVS and AVS is just so cool for making procedural visuals (tons of noob presets prove it imho). but it is just to cumbrsome in some aspects, if cubes were easyer to make a lot les of them would see the light of day. if it had some way of importing 3d objects, an easy way to control the camera and object transformations,... you would see a lot more than just cubes. as it is its hard to expect good stuff unles you put years of work in it. the programers make complex and a bit less beautiful stuff and designer people make simple and better looking things. and both get better with time (excuse me if i went a bit off topic, im drunk again). anyway, gimme an AVS with gpu, video and midi support (Fridge) and ill stop drinking and get to work:P.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Same thing really, this is the epicentre of it all. Maybe deviantart was but there's precisely dick going on over there in the way of community now.<br />
      <br />
      There's still presets being made and fun to be had, but there's the undeniable feeling that it's on its last legs. We need a better, more efficient, (possibly standalone) successor with similar or ideally more versatility. But unfortunately I am not the man for the job or I'd be all over it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, i think its just that with AVS, most people can create _something_ themselves. Anything else there are many historic packs out there to download. And the barrier for entry in writing good presets is too high for most.<br />

      How you could change avs to fix those issues, I do not know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think there could be another avs plugin that is more simple and is less dependent on the avser and more on the program. For example there should be a pan option in trans even though you can do it in a convo filter or in dynamic shift.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think the main problem of avs is that it depends on winamp. Avs as a player-independend plugin would be great.<br />
      If it was programmed so that it ran with any mediaplayer more people would use it. Now only winamp-users can use avs.<br />
      Winamp has been one of the (maybe the) most used mediaplayer - but now there are much more other player.<br />
      foobar2000 for example. I for music only prefer the windows media player 11.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      another thing:<br />
      is it possible to make an APE that can get the spectroscop of the music more accurate. I heard that data is given in 500 or so values. That's not very much.<br />
      With a more detailed scale it was (at least theoreticly) possible to programm a very precise music-analyser. One that find one loud tone and look for tones that have the same frequency 2,4,8,16... times higher. (you could have a value that gives you the "brilliance" of a tone (a razor-sharp tone could then have another effect than a very soft one).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thats right. (except about WMP11). But... Winamp might go out of business (not likely but possible). People will just get it for the avs plugin. Cheapass's. About the APE... fiddle with the coding or get someone else to do it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">sorry if no one likes what i say, but in my opinion the player (WINAMP)/ the depending of avs on winamp is the problem. I am not capable to solve it. I don't have the problem either. I don't have a problem using 2 players on my computer. Some people out there have this problem.<br />
      I mean those people that don't make presets themself, but are just watching them. If they have to use another player as the one they use normally they will sooner or later loose their interest. Winamp is not such a great player ...<br />
      <br />
      I make presets for fun. If other people see them is not so important - there aren't so muc already.<br />
      If you say avs is dead - maybe for you. I never saw it be alive, because I started making presets just about a year ago. If Avs beeing alive so little was a problem for me why did I started? For me there is not such a great need for reigniting the whole community - it would be great, of course! - but i can also go on like this and have fun.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is boring, no-one's going to say anything. So I will. When I joined there was nothing happenning and everything was empty. Then I made my "Tips and Tricks" thread. Gee I thought I was cool. But then people said "What are you doing you retard". And maybe that stirred the pot, but at the same time a whole bunch of juinor members appeared. I was the first, I don't know if I should feel proud but I do. The point is, the AVS forums are being overwhelmed by newbies and it's wrecking it. If the newbies were dumb like me (I'm not dumb), the big kids would sort it out it would be ok. But the big kids are too lazy.<br />

      but what exactly is it that needs fixing in your eyes?<br />
      in my opinion it's the newbies that have just duscovered avs and are producing some avs that is, in the eyes of the seniors here, sub-sub-standard. but that is no problem of course, how could they be masters right away? [i mean there still was this kar-ma guy who had some surprising talent, but hey...]<br />
      what the newbs need then is "guidance" of some sort, the so called "constructive criticism" [which is at a low in these forums, admitted].<br />
      the conflict i have as someone who could provide this, is that most of the time i don't feel very inclined to comment on yet another "trippy-supernovae-water-zomg-so-fat" newbie preset when at the same time i know that i committed the same stuff when i began, and that i could and should help to improve.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The majority of the presets and the artists of the <i>oldschool</i> AVS scene died off with the inclusion of the DM and the SSC. The <i>newschool</i> scene exploded and more and more people became interested in it. More features were added, mostly as a result of the artists' demand, eventually taking matters into their own hands using skill and ingenuity to create their own features. Then as the entire artform began to evolve as the presets became more intricate, artists' kept resetting the bar both for themselves and for the entire community. Viewers and artists alike demanded more and more fresh and complex ideas to continue the <i>Wow!</i> factor to keep everyone coming back for more.<br />
      <br />
      Admittedly, I haven't even opened up AVS since April, and I haven't looked around for any new packs in quite some time either, but the last few packs I can remember downloading that really made my jaw drop were Tuggummi's <i>Functions</i>, Pak-9's <i>5</i>, and Hboy's <i>Mindscapes</i>. For me, 2005 was the pinnacle year for AVS.<br />
      <br />
      I think it's great that there are people who are still holding on, working to create presets and keep the artform and the community going. But, right or wrong, it's apparent that the same old things don't keep people interested anymore. AVS had to transcend to stay alive as long as it did, but I think it reached its peak, and I too am sorry to say that AVS is dead to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>NEW STUFF</strong><br />
      In my opinion avs is far from dead, it just needs a boost.<br />
      The standalone avs program is an awesome idea, that would more than likely be a huge boost to avs as a whole, including the community. I think avs needs something else altogether.<br />
      <br />
      NEW STUFF.<br />
      <br />
      A few new renders and filters wouldn't hurt. I think avs has exhausted a lot of its possibilities by having all of these people work on it without making new tools to work with.<br />
      <br />
      you can only build so much with a single load of lumber.<br />
      <br />
      another possibility is making a winamp port for psp</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wrong.<br />
      <br />
      Think of a render that can't be implemented using existing AVS components. Got an idea there?<br />
      <br />
      We have no shortage of crazy ideas... browsing the forums will find 101 requests for random features. The problem is that nobody wants to do work on AVS to revive it... its a huge messy pile of code riddled with hacks and tricks, mostly uncommented.</p>

      Now it's not the right time to do it, but GC and I thought maybe in a year or something we will sit down, learn programming (gc's uncle) and then we will try to revive avs.<br />

      ..And that is also the point: how could avs(or how-ever it is called then) be changed to be faster on multicore-systems.<br />
      <br />
      Another thing that I think is needed is a more accurate spekrum/oscillograph. In Avs it is limited to 500 or so isn't it?<br />

      </blockquote>Yes. I have tried this as part of the Fridge team, it never gets further than a window, maybe with a skin and OpenGL support or something... It would be easier if I was doing it on my own, but still, I would be deluding myself to think I would finish it alone. :)<br />
      <br />
      Justin wrote this pretty much on his own, but he is a f*cking awesome coder.<br />
      <br />
      One tip. Do not spend to much time on design. IMO that was the largest contributing factor to the nothingness of Fridge. As good as a really thorough design is, all that time spent is wasted if you don't actually develop the thing afterwards. :)<br />

      </blockquote>Nothing personal, but most people need a good year of simple programming (VB, Java, etc...) before being exposed to the Windows API... much less building something as elaborate as AVS.<br />

      </blockquote>Don't start thinking about that yet, you do not have the knowledge to work this stuff out yet... Post-processing ("after-effects") can be implemented on graphics cards in lots of ways, but they are not unique in that respect. Everything that AVS renders could be hardware accelerated to some extent, even DM. However, you always need to use some CPU... even if it is just to pump instructions down the bus for the graphics card or ticking over waiting for the graphics card to complete something.<br />

      </blockquote>Again, don't think about this now. Lots of graphics problems are what is called "embarrassingly parellel" i.e. AVS is an ideal candidate for multithreading, and it wouldn't be hard. Once you have done quite a bit of code... you should be able to work this out.<br />

      </blockquote>This is how the Winamp plugin API works. Personally the accuracy of the data is not really needed for AVS... people are more likely to complain about the graphics first, and very few presets use osc/spec values for anything meaningful.<br />

      Hope this helps somewhat. :)

      <p class="post-content">the problem is not so much in avs i think, though i'd love to see it to have a future it won't get. if there was wider support for third party players, my motivation would certainly be higher. when you watch the avs submissions on deviantart, you will notice a massive drop of comments and downloads, and there it was where the scene and appreciators came together. what other sign do you need to see avs is clearly dead. what are the chances? in the unlikely case that some of the above comes true and avs gets a major update, my guess is it wouldn't change a lot as time makes people forget. the high popularity of other mediaplayers than winamp and the increasing shifts away from windows don't better the situation.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow ... this will take me a while to answer... :)<br />
      <br />
      Yeah Jheriko you're right maybe that we are a little too ambitious/illusionated (sry for my language btw). But Avs needs a new start - or at least the idea of visuals moving to music. Other applications like milkdrop are far away of the capability of avs.<br />
      I don't really want to revive avs. Actually i would like to have a totally new program that is not a plugin. It should be an external programm, that can get music data via plugins in those media players. Maybe this could also work via LAN. (In a club there could be one PC for the music and one for the visuals - just to be sure that if the visuals-pc crashes there is still music playing).<br />
      Yathosho said a while ago that we're livin in "HD-age" but avs is still bound to resolutions like 300*400. With the actual AVS this won't change.<br />
      I do want to have a new visualization-programm, and I will at least try to make it - even if it's just for my own.<br />
      <br />
      .....<br />
      <br />
      What did you mean with design?<br />
      <br />
      .....<br />
      <br />
      Yeah i know it will take it's time(a lot), but GC and I are a good team with avs - why couldn't this work with programming? We're not in a hurry, and we both really really like avs - i think we have the right motivation.<br />
      For me the only way is to rebuild the whole thing from the ground.<br />
      <br />
      .....<br />
      <br />
      The winamp plugin works with this 500(or so) band spectrums...<br />
      That's why i want to change it.<br />
      In the last months (especially as i found out how to use the megabuf --big THANKS for the avtrans!!!) i realised, that with some spectrumanalyzing routines there could be lots of things made. A 500 band spec is good already, but if i want avs(or whatever) to realize how many different tones there are used the spec data has to be more accurate (at least in the mid-frequencies).<br />
      I more and more like to get my presets very sensitive for the music. I don't really use the "beat" anymore (when you're listening to prog-metal, or flamenco the beat-detection is reacting very bad.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe ... if you're still into it we will ask you for help in a year or more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't be put off by me, but don't be too eager. Programming is very very hard and I suck at it. I've been doing it for about 17 years now (!), since I was 7-8 years old... and I still suck. Something like AVS is miles away from a first project, its the sort of thing you write after a lot of smaller programs to gain the know how. Some of the things invloved, like the scripting language or the graphics algorithsm, are specialist topics even amongst programmers. The average code monkey will go his entire career without having any idea on how to create these things.<br />
      <br />
      Beware HD btw, it really underwhelms me after years of using monitors. TVs are miles behind... AVS presets can push HD res (see the &lt;several years old I might add&gt; HiRes pack included with J7, most of those presets are smooth running at 1080p (1920-1080) (the highest res HD standard afaik)).<br />
      <br />
      But do feel free to ask me questions. I'm much better at explaining how to do things I once did than actually doing them ever again...<br />

      <p class="post-content">&lt;Brain dump with no particular topic...&gt;<br />
      <br />
      I notice that the proponents of the "AVS revival" are almost always wide eyed noobs who more often than not disappear entirely from the avs scene after a couple of months, so forgive my pessimism.<br />
      <br />
      J is right about AVS/Programmable Visualisation being a really quite complicated project. AVS for example has a frikkin compiler in it, and there is real world research that says compilers are roughly twice as complicated as conventional programs. Combine that with some fairly hardcore graphics/dsp, and a seriously challenging interface design problem and you've got yourself a MAJOR project. If I was at a company making that piece of software I would relish it, but trying to do it for the hell of it in your spare time is something else. And as J pointed out its entirely not the sort of project you would attempt without some good programming experience. And yes, Jason is awesome.<br />
      <br />
      HuRriC4nE: Most commercial VJ packages output 320 x 240, the resolution of your monitor is not representative of club screens, projectors etc... Thats not to say home users dont want good resolutions tho (and its perfectly plausible with hardware acceleration). Also, regarding the resolution of spectrum data, 512 bands is plenty enough, I challenge you to give me one example where you would need more.</p>

      Anyway, we'll probably be looking for one other reviewer... someone who's more active. I really don't know why they never did it before. Haven't had a proper day's rest because of this retarded quasi bologna system for ages now and even when I could find the time, it first crashed on me and then I lost my pass. Blah. It's supposed to be working now and the pass is recoverable, but I can visit only sporadically. Even if it's "dying", that probably isn't enough.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok, i get it. but actually i thought it to be a bit like that. just like in avs, you can't just start off being a pro. well that was stating the obvious, but anyway - i guess once this get's started and assume we're not bored away or freaked out by the project and it get's to a slightly decent state, we might get some help further down the way.<br />
      possibly maybe...<br />
