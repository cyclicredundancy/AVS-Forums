      Hi !<br />
      <br />
      I want to do a headbanging animation. I have got a headbanger on avi, how do I have to proceed to make him headbang to the music - please give me/us something made-ready or a real step-by-step guide.<br />
      <br />
      Greetings<br />
      <br />
      Yeah<br />
      <br />
      PS: Is there a better beat detection available ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">A really very simple way of doing it could be by adding an effects list. Disable enabled and enabled on beat for, then set how ever many frames you want it to play for in the text box.<br />
      Then add render:AVI in the effects list. Find you AVI from the list (fyi avi's need to be in the avs root folder, generally C:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs)<br />
      Then set the speed for the AVI to play.<br />
      It's quite cheap but it would play the AVI on beat, thus lame head banging (ish).<br />
      <br />
      As for better beat detection, if you don't want to use either of the two built in ones then you will need to learn AVS and write your own or find a nice preset which has it's own code and use that.<br />
      <br />
      You could also just use as a picture and some DM skills to make an image headbang.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There's no way, as far as I know to manipulate the display of frames of a video in avs. It can be inputted, but it will only play at its normal speed. A crazy way I can think of off the top of my head would be to have all the necessary frames for a good animation of it, then write a beat prediction code (AVS beat detection isn't that great, but can be coded to be better within itself), then display the frames as this proceeds and then, roughly at best the head will bang to the beat.<br />
      <br />
      Seems an awful lot of arseing about for something like that, but it is doable. AVS isn't really the thing for it, I wouldn't know of alternatives though. AVS is more of an abstract program, there are infinite possibilities of specific things you can build in it but it takes a lot of time and patience to gain the skills for it.</p>

      The only good way I can think of, if you want to have control over the frames, is have multiple effect lists with a render/picture in each, all displaying different frames, then dissable and enable the effect lists accordingly. Im order to manipulate the frames with the beat, you could probably find the bpm and use it to adjust the frame rate.</p>

      </blockquote>Idea.<br />
      Remember Raz's little spectrum analyser preset with the picture animation from Raz 3?<br />
      Well if you do then the principle of syncing pictures to a simple beat counter that activates with each beat and removes each picture then resets.<br />
      <br />
      try this for a start.<br />
      <br />
      make a superscope and empty it or use the gvm.ape and put this code in it<br />
      Frame:<br />
      reg01=0;<br />
      // this makes a counter.<br />
      reg00=bb;<br />
      <br />
      Beat:<br />
      bb=if(equal(bb,13),0,bb+1);<br />
      /* this is the counter that will reset when bb reachs the value of beats. there are 13 texers with a active picture so you use 13 as your value*/<br />
      <br />
      Next you take the number each beat the counter detects and use this.<br />
      <br />
      Make a new TexerII<br />
      Frame:<br />
      reg01=reg01+1;<br />
      // this will go up by 1 for every TexerII you make.<br />
      <br />
      on=if(equal(reg00,1),1,0);<br />
      n=on;<br />
      /* this will turn one image on each time with the texerII<br />
      when the registers value reachs the value of the equal and turn it off when it is not.*/<br />
      <br />
      I hope this helps.<br />
      <br />
      i'll post a example.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      make sure when you save the file you save it as "beatanimation.avs" be sure to add the quotes.

      <p class="post-content">I have a hard time understanding what you wrote, Nanakiwurkz.<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded your sample and included frames of the animation. It does not do the job.<br />
      <br />
      Please upload a file for me to include<br />
      <br />
      a) frames of the animation<br />
      <br />
      or<br />
      <br />
      b) an avi<br />
      <br />
      What is more, the beat detection does anything but detecting the beat. And there's a winamp plugin, called MP3-Remix. It detects the beat perfectly but it is closed source.<br />
      <br />
      Lastly winamp.com's search option does not offer any spectrum analyser preset from Raz. Where do I find this and also his Raz3 ?<br />
      <br />
      Or do it yourself if you publish it. You got the bird...</p>

      Also, i did this, and i don't know why. Shouldn't expect other people to do things like this for you, but this time it beat doing work for another 20 minutes.<br />
      <br />
      Put the first frame in the picture2 outside the effect lists. And each picture2 in the subsequent effect lists gets the next frame of animation. There's 10 frames available.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Two things:<br />
      <br />
      Everytime on beat the head should be down. Which part of the animation should be in which module ?<br />
      <br />
      What do we do with this preinstalled beat detection ?<br />
      <br />
      BTW: There is no picture2 here. I replaced it with render/picture.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The first picture should be head up. The last picture should be head down. And if you're without picture 2, then i expect global vars won't work on yours. Get winamp 5.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I got winamp 5. What about the beat detection alg.<br />
      <br />
      This is the main problem right now, I cannot figure out whether it works. I just see the bird banging for no reason...<br />
      <br />
      I want my bird to be always visible. So if the beat is 'slow', ie 60 bpm then the bird should be down - up - down in one second. If 180 bpm I want it to go down - up - down in 1/3 second, i hope you get the idea.<br />
      <br />
      Just as a normal headbanger would. But this is of secondary importance, how do we improve beat detection - or should we not use AVS but milkdrop instead ?</p>
