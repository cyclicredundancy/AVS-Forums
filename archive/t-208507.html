      <p class="post-content">So what was the Lionhead dancing bear done in? I understand that most if not all avs are produced with some external programme but are then converted to be able to be used in winamp and mind you are programmed in C, am i asking in the wrong place?</p>

      To create/edit an AVS preset, open the AVS window, right click and select AVS editor. Oh yea, don't forget to disable the pixel doubling: settings&gt;display<br />
      <br />
      I think you're in the wrong place, but a lot of things, if not all, things can be rendered in AVS, you'd just have to do it over in AVS code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">that dancing bear was not made using AVS<br />
      it was made by wildtangent using their own toolkit (which they prolly wont disclose :D)<br />
      if you plan to do something similar, you should look into C or C++ programming and OpenGL (or Direct3D if you're masochistic) rendering. you'll prolly need the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/nsdn/winamp/sdk" target="_blank">winamp sdk for it</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">you mean using your render as an image (say .jpg) for the background and a render object for the waterfall?<br />

      <p class="post-content">or you make a small .avi file with 3D studio max and use goebish's new avi player APE to make it react to beats<br />

      </blockquote>See we don't code winamp plugins here, we make AVS presets. What you want to know is can you code a plugin for winamp, in which case you're totally in the wrong forum.<br />
      <br />
      I can't see <b>why</b> you couldn't... unless you're trying to ask help for <b>how</b> to code it, in which case most of us can't even help.

      <p class="post-content">Jheriko has made a global variables APE which can load data into the gmegabuf from a file. He has actually written a little program that converts 3d studio max files into the loadable format for use with the triangle APE. But bear in mind if you take this approach you need to:<br />
      <br />
      Get the triangle ape<br />
      Get the global variables APE<br />
      Get that program off Jheriko<br />
      Learn how to program the triange ape<br />
      Write a triangle sorting algorithm in AVS<br />
      Write a triangle rendering algorithm in AVS<br />
      Make your preset<br />
      <br />
      And quite frankly I can only think of a handfull of experienced AVS artists who could do all that... (you arent one of them)</p>
