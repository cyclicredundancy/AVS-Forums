      <p class="post-content">this should be no problem if your graphics/capture card has a TV-out<br />
      simply connect the TV to the TV-out and run AVS in fullscreen mode</p>

      <p class="post-content">Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure capture cards are meant specifically for Input. It won't help if your graphics card doesn't have a tv out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">does your tv work with windowed AVS?<br />
      if so, you could try overlay mode. (Settings/Display/Overlay mode)<br />
      if that works, try fullscreen overlay mode.(Settings/Fullscreen/fullscreen overlay mode.)<br />
      <br />
      if that didn't help, try this:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Uhm Pinnacle DV card? Correct me, but i think that is used only for video capture from your videocamera into your pc ;)<br />
      <br />
      You can only output avs with your gfx card's tv output and since it's like using your TV as a monitor it shouldn't be any different in theory. But there has been complications with the tv-output before, but im not sure were they the fault of the incompatibility with the tv &amp; gfx card or was it specificly avs's fault. I find it mysterious that displaying avs on tv would be any different from normal computer -&gt; tv output :igor:<br />
      <br />
      But then again i have never used tv output :p</p>
