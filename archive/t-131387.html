Simultaneously? What would be the sens of doing this unless you can merge both with some kind of software video mixer.

		It has been a long time since one of these threads. :);)<br />
<br />
Personally I think you should look at all what is out there if only to see the options. Dismissing without seeing something is IMHO foolhardy.

That is not what I meant. I meant have you ever used both AVS and Milkdrop normally but near the same time for example: first you make some AVS presets then you make some Milkdrop ones.

Let not have a flame war about this folks. :);):D<br />
<br />
MilkDrop IMHo is pretty poor by todays standards of what could be done and ryan has been lazy/busy/had stuff in r/l to deal with over the last year so it has not been updated.<br />
<br />
Maybe the next version............:)<br />
<br />
Or some AVS/MilkDrop hybird new visualization that Nullsoft could produce it is about time. :)

		IMO, this should be done with 3d capapble elements, 3ddm and 3dssc. Each element should draw the result on a 3d map again.<br />
