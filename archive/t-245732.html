<div class="posttext">Well this is the first time I actually heard some one said that he's sorry. They usauly just leave and never come back. <br />
<br />
So he insulted some people but deserves some credit for steping out like that and saying he's sorry, he's the first of his kind.<br />
<br />
For my part though, you really don't need to apologize, you never pisssed me off so don't worry about me.<br />
<br />
Peace people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There are really only stupid questions, Florin; while people can be stupid, it is the most remediable of things human. The problem lies in the judgment, which itself is the essence of nihilism. Ever wonder why things have no meaning? Nanakiwurkz provided a handy demonstration; what has been learned? If people are still just objects to be ordered and reordered at ego's whim, then.... Personally, as I see the New Guard (so to speak) come in here, and repeat the same mistakes of the Old, I have to ask myself if anything is really any different (much less, better).</div></div><hr />
