      Milkdrop is alright, but AVS has a better feel/control to it IMO.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're an idiot anyway :p<br />
      <br />
      making 3d is not too hard as it's quite simple to do with x,y,z coordinates but thy have to be&#194;&#180;mapped back to 2d, thats what makes it a bit difficult.<br />
      <br />
      Furthermore it's not that easy to make a really interesting looking 3d preset. I get sick on seeing simple rotating cubes, this has been done way too often.<br />

      </blockquote>Igonre this advice. Its wrong. The EL-VIS 3D code may have been used to create some very amazing presets but codewise it is cack. Long winded, inefficient and difficult to read. Try using some much *much* simpler code. Tons of us have written much better 3D code and explained it in the forums, preset comments and such.<br />
      <br />
      If you can't be arsed to search here is how to do it:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />per frame: <br /><br />rx=...;ry=...;rz=...;crx=cos(rx);srx=sin(rx);cry=cos(ry);sry=sin(ry);crz=cos(rz);srz=sin(rz);asp=h/w;<br /><br />per point:<br /><br />x1=...;<br />y1=...;<br />z1=...;<br /><br />x2=x1*crz-y1*srz;<br />y2=x1*srz+y1*crz;<br />x1=x2*cry+z1*sry;<br />z2=-x2*sry+z1*cry;<br />y1=y2*crx-z2*srx;<br />z1=y2*srx+z2*crx;<br />z1=1/(dst+z1*scale);<br />x=x1*z1;<br />y=y1*z1;<br />x=x*asp;<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      x1, y1, z1 set at the top are used just like x and y. dst and scale have to be replaced by constants and these represent the distance into the screen that the origin is and a scaling factor on the z-axis to control how much perspective there is. Usually I use dst=2 and scale = 0.5 to give z1=1/(2+z1*0.5);. rx, ry, rz are the rotations around the three axes, when these are all zero the z axis points through the screen and x and y are their usual selves.<br />
      <br />
      You don't need to understand this code to use it, just write expressions for rx, ry, rz, x1, y1 and z1 as you would write for x, y, d, r or anything else.<br />
      <br />
      The crx,srx... variables are simply used to optimise the code. If you really want to make the code neater (but slower) you can replace crx with cos(rx).. etc in the per point box.
