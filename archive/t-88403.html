			<strong>I don't think so...</strong><br />
		
		

		No, you can't use .avs in powerpoint nor in any software that's not AVS...But you can capture AVS output to AVI with an APE like avsgrabber.ape ,and I think you can insert AVI files in powerpoint files ;)

			<strong>quite simple</strong><br />
		
		

		I've used Power Point a lot with AVI &amp; MPEG video files, and it's quite simple.  If you're going to be delivering it on another computer, either burn a CD-R disc or you can use a Zip drive to transfer the Power Point.<br />
<br />
A word of advice if you're giving it on another computer:  Be sure to run the &quot;Pack and Go&quot; command under the File menu.  Then look for the two files with the extracted information from power point (one should be a .png and the other should be a .ppt file).  If you don't do this and you give it on another computer, you'll probably find yourself with the Power Point you made minus the AVI files.  (I don't want what happened to me to happen to you.  I felt pretty stupid, but thinking back on it now is funny) :D)<br />
<br />
You'll probably want to capture them uncompressed and then use a program that can change compression rates to compress them.  I've found that trying to run AVI files uncompressed is a little too slow while running PowerPoint-especially if you're not running it off of a CD.<br />
<br />
If you decide to use a CD-R disc, remember that once you burn it, you can't modify the PowerPoint except after you install it on the computer you'll be using to view it.  The self-installing wizard will probably promt you whether you want to overwrite any files with the same file name.  Click yes, and it will extract the Power Point directly in the C:\ folder.<br />
<br />
While editing AVI files, I don't recommend overwriting them; I'd recommend that you create a new file each time you modify any .avi file.  (sure tedius updating your video files you insert in PowerPoint, but it pays off when you compress a video file too much, because you have all your old versions-which saves a lot of time).  <br />
<br />
You probably have a faster computer than me, but I've found it more efficient to capture it using AVSGrabber uncompressed &amp; then to go back &amp; compress it with another AVI editing program.  Using AVSGrabber to compress the avi file being captured is just too slow (on my computer).  <br />
<br />
If you're very familiar with Power Point, then you probably already know this; but be aware that if you don't select to have the video play automatically that you'll have to click it to start it.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to answer any additional questions you have about using PowerPoint for various questions/problems.  I've experienced firsthand most of the possible problems that are possible to run into while using AVI in PowerPoint. :) Just don't want you to run into the same problems I ran into<br />

Good luck on the PowerPoint! :)

			<strong>I know there's no crossover</strong><br />
		
		

		I don't smoke crack, first off (if that's what you were hinting at)-I know there's no direct crossover, but using AVI in PowerPoint has some...challenges...I wanted to inform nickdimmick about that he might run into.  <br />
<br />
nickdimmick:  I've made many mistakes while doing power points(made of .avi files), and I don't want you to repeat the same problems I've run into.  :)
