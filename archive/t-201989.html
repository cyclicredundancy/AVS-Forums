		i got it :D, <br />
1st: go into a video ... there should be a button that looks like this <a href="http://img128.exs.cx/img128/7384/videosettings7xs.jpg" target="_blank">http://img128.exs.cx/img128/7384/videosettings7xs.jpg</a><br />
click it... a thing will pop-up and Click <b>Video Options</b><br />
<br />
making sure ur in video Preferences -&gt; video playback...  <br />
uncheck &quot;Display the Video when playback begins...&quot;<br />
<br />
there problem solved, :)

		thank you, but thats not what i really wanted.<br />
when a video plays, i want a video to show.<br />
when an mp3 plays, i want a vis.<br />
like in win media player 10.<br />
if you make a playlist with mp3s and avi video.<br />
when there is a video, the video plays.<br />
when there is an mp3, a vis plays.<br />
there is no need to switch from video screen to vis screen.<br />
with my winamp now, when a video plays, it shows in the video screen.  then when an mp3 plays after, it just shows the llama logo.  i can click the &quot;switch to visulizer&quot; button, but i dont want to after every video.  i did get it to where when a video plays, it shows the video.  when an mp3 plays, the vid window closes, but it then minimizes the vis window as well.<br />
<br />
i also want to do this in full screen. this way at parties, i can just leave my comp go in a locked room and not have to monitor it durring the party.  (there's about 6 tvs thru the house hooked up to the computer/vcr/sterio)
