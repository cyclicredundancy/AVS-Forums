			<strong>Superscope in WoW. :)</strong><br />
		
		

		Here are two 32x32 sized superscopes. They're a little too much for the WoW client, but you can run one of these fine. Both at the same time and you can notice a difference. You might be able to get away with two or three render plugins chained -- 3 would be tough.. :) <br />

Edit: Feel free to provide simple examples that may work with such a small visualization. I don't know the math involved. I have n=32 or so.

		Sorry but I don't have a clue of what you're trying to accomplish. <br />
Is this a question? if yes, what is the question?

		It's not really a question. I was just showing off. But if people want to help, they can provide real simple superscopes that fit in 32x32 worth of space, or perhaps 64x64 at most.

		The cool thing is this makes it possible to draw images in WoW, even if not animated. Just chain some superscopes together and there's an image. Or at least I think it can do this. I saw a car drawn from superscopes, and I believe I saw a dungeon crawler built from superscopes.

		Well, I should probably offer some test bed, huh? I guess this whole thing is more oriented to WoW players than anything. So I'm writing an addon called StarVisuals. It'll have AVS elements, and a scriptable image widget for drawing generic images.<br />
<br />
Here's the project page if you're interested. You'll need to dig into the code to configure the superscope parameters. Currently there's no chaining render elements, and all that's available is superscope. I've started on Blur some.<br />
<br />
Anyone play WoW? Want to draw something? <br />

		I suggest you check out <a href="http://pak-9.deviantart.com/art/AVS-Programming-Guide-11200891" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial first. Also, download some more packs either here on winamp.com or deviantart. If you still think you're showing off with built-in effects that are about 10 years old you'd be quite surprised of the possibilities.

		I've been reading some tips and tricks around the board. I found one preset and snatched one single superscope from it and here's the result. It dances around to random data, and then I mix up all its variables so it turns into a blob when there's a &quot;beat&quot;, then moments later it returns to the visualization shown. Apparently I can show the disk at any angle. I haven't figured that out yet. I know it's a bit too heavy for general WoW usage, but it has its ooh and ahh factor. :)<br />

		Well, this is AVS related. This forum is where I'm getting all of my information from. I mean it's Superscope. o.O What's wrong with showing off AVS spawn in the AVS forum?  I think that's highly unfair to suggest I'm not welcome. But if you all insist I shove off, so be it. Pretty crappy if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Edit: This is also where I'll send users, to search presets and your faqs. Am I welcome to do so? I doubt there'll be many users at all.

		All I know is I'm certainly having a blast learning about all of this. Sorry if I get carried away with showing off.
