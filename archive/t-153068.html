			<strong>Wish: AVS Had Book----&gt; For Beginners&lt;----kooB daH SVA :hsiW</strong><br />
		
		

		I wish if Nullsoft could publish AVS books in the world for beginners AVSer's, All of eagers of creating AVS could buy these books on the internet by credit card or buy paying the money in shopping in all of world.<br />
<br />
In this book we could see the first parameters of creating AVS from easy to hard DM's &amp; SS's with gods of AVS such as: UnConeD, EL-VIS, Tuggummi, skupers,....<br />
<br />
If Nullsoft could publish this books all of interested peoples in the world use these methods for creating their own AVS.<br />
<br />
I hope one day I will can see these books on the web or in my shopping center in my town.<br />
:up: :up: :up: :up: :up: :cool:

		I wish Shabaviz55 had a book to learn english from, because it seems like he doesn't understand a word of what he's reading around here.

		The idea of creating a book for all these nice AVS tricks might sound like a good idea but the fact that these tricks are comprised from all other types of programming and math quickly shoots down that idea.  SOO if you want to learn tricks and cool techniques then you should just go learn other programming and math crap and then apply it to AVS. I'm pretty sure thats how most good AVS guys get their new new techniques am I right?  Thats what I do anyways.

Just remember that the formal way is not the best way. Take Zeven's realtime lighting RGB DM, for example.

That is the way I do it as well, and I know others do also.  &quot;Complex&quot; presets normally are things that are fairly simple to do outside of AVS(although not always) - the complicated part is rewriting it using simple things AVS understands - damn the lack of matrices and better control structures.
