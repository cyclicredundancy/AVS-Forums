      <p class="post-content">Good second pack. I can see you're experimenting with scopes and DM's good. The plasma preset looks really nice. There are some very noob presets in there but i can see you're starting to transition into making scopes and DM's. Chill with the bumps though. It's not a great effect when it's on almost every preset. Keep working at it, i can see you're getting better. My intro was a nice touch wasn't it :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is my review of your presets.<br />
      <br />
      3 in 1 - Kind of ugly. But at least it uses some SSC's and DM's instead of simple's and default movements.<br />
      <br />
      abstract painting - OK.<br />
      <br />
      bdb(beendonebefore) - Not very nice and quite simple.<br />
      <br />
      cut out - Ugly. And it disappears after a while.<br />
      <br />
      Dials - Not very complicated or nice looking.<br />
      <br />
      first audio then uranium - Ugly.<br />
      <br />
      god of pyramids - Very very simple.<br />
      <br />
      hiccups - Not terrible but could be a lot better.<br />
      <br />
      intro by Raz001 - Thanks for including my name in the comment but you forgot the r in Hungryskull.<br />
      <br />
      metal slide - Quite nice.<br />
      <br />
      mixing candy - Nice but I don't like the SSC.<br />
      <br />
      radioactive box - Don't like this one.<br />
      <br />
      reflectric 2 - Ugly.<br />
      <br />
      reflectric - Better looking than reflectric 2.<br />
      <br />
      ring of fire - Don't like this one much either.<br />
      <br />
      Roundabout plasma - I like this one a bit.<br />
      <br />
      tracer scope - Looks fairly bad.<br />
      <br />
      transitions - Don't like this one.<br />
      <br />
      tumbling - OK looks a bit like spilled paint or somthing like that.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry if my review is too harsh. You should try to make some 3D presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Good pack for your level of coding ! A little overuse of the bump and the dynamic shift...:)<br />
      Tip : try using DM with rectangular coordinates ONLY at the beggining then work with polar coordinateds and after that combine them.If you are using them together without knowing what they do you`ll get some ugly effects and no one wants them.Also dont use the b in coding...Replace it with a bt or a p or a custom variable and define it in the OnBeat box like bt=rand(number) or getosc(x,y,z)*small number or whatever(note that x,y,z in getosc are NUMBERS that axes).Oh and DMs that move on x and y(axes) can be replaced with smth simpler like a movement with x=x-0.05 or y=y+0.03...<br />
      Hungryskull - 3D aint everything ;) Most of the most(huh?) beautiful presets are 2D.Look at a recent thread in Troubleshooting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice pack. Most movements are just too fast (or my computer is ;) ). So what do I like best? mhh.. Radioactive Box i would say.<br />
      What I really don't like are 3 In 1 and Dials. And as the others said you should use the bumping less.</p>

      </blockquote>Sorry I didn't mean to say 2D presets suck because I like some 2D presets and make some myself. I was just suggesting that he should maybe make some 3D presets. I also don't really like default movements and simple's or stuff like that I almost think they should be taken out of AVS but they are OK if you just started.

      <p class="post-content">I found 2 of them interesting. Radioactive box and the intro.<br />
      I'm not an authority in avs but I think you should use more diffirent effects. Many of your presets are just too similar.To achieve nicer colors u should experiment with blendings/effectlists (30-40 mushrooms will also do the trick)</p>

      <p class="post-content">By searching the forums and reading the FAQ to get some information on how they work. Also playing around can help because sooner or later you'll figure out what happens when you add a certain line of code but it leaves your coding skills very limited. The best thing to do is to get a lot of information and learn and don't move on until you understand why "that does that".</p>

      </blockquote>I think playing around and random coding IS the best way to learn ssc's. And then when you understand how it works, then you can code whatever you want easily. First make something basic and then play around with it till you make what you like.

      This pack is what I like to call: A Pro-n00bian pack. There are some that look somewhat professional, and some that are downright n00bish.<br />
      <br />
      Some of the scopes are a bit ugly, I think you should try to make your presets a bit more.....whole. There is alot of black screen in your presets, you should probably work on fixing that. Otherwise, you're making good progress.:up:</p>
