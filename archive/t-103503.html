      <p class="post-content"><strong>tv out + avs = mega cool</strong><br />
      little recommendation here, if you have a tv out try running your avs on fullscreen with it.. you may have to run in a a reasonably high resolution but you can get fat fps + incredible visual quality... try it. coolest thing this week for me, did it once before but seeing it again.. dam its good :)</p>

      the lessons i learned:<br />
      <br />
      never jump a train, even if it is one stop<br />
      don't walk around with 4.5oz of hash on your person<br />
      always expect everyone else to be an a**hole towards you<br />
      never rely on your friends when it is something really important</p>

      <p class="post-content">Regardless of forum rules, drugs can be discussed in a mature way. I'm sure these posts could be considered "inciting others to consume", but then again I don't think there's anything wrong with pot as long as you regulate your consumption and keep your brain switched on.<br />

      Change of topic then :)</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>better on lcd projector !!!!</strong><br />
      here's a piece of my last show in france (08/24/2002); <a href="http://vfx0.free.fr/VFX-Bzh-24-08-2002.avi" target="_blank">http://vfx0.free.fr/VFX-Bzh-24-08-2002.avi</a> , notice that AVS is better on a lcd projector than on VGA :)<br />
      <br />
      by the way, how many grams are there in 1 oz ? ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think that reason of good looking is that tv's &amp; projectors neither got so high resolution as we use to set to our monitors. And that is why you dont see any pixels.<br />
      <br />
      Goebish? What kind of video format you use for that videos in your website. I cant watch them from work and @ home I got dial-up connection, which is pretty expensive [about 8 us cents per minute].<br />
      I would like to download a decoder..</p>
