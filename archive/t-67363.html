			<strong>is there a visualization radomizer?</strong><br />
		
		

		I have been looking, but to no avail.  Is there a program that you can download to randomly play all your visualizations you have installed?  It would probably basically have to scan your winamp directory to find them all, from there it would just open and shut each one randomly, hopefully doing all of the presets randomly within a set time as well.

			<strong>I thought AVS was visualization</strong><br />
		
		

		This is an AVS discussion, I thought AVS was Visualization, oh well.  I found what you were talking about, still messing with it.  But what I was talking about was a program that would randomize your visualization plug-ins that you downloaded.  Like going from the G-force to Geiss plug-in without any user interaction after it is started.  But maybe this does it as well, like I said, im still messing with it.
