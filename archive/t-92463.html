      I d/l 3 el-vis avs' and a few others. when i first put them on my machine they worked perfectly (for the most part--some didn't initiate). for instance, i put on el vis' "my eye on you" from Plasma and it was beautiful. so i come back later to check it out, and as soon as it brings up the image it freezes. this started happening with several others (particularly from the Plasma package) as well as some of the Finnish AVS'. Strange, cuz I didn't touch any of the settings. I went so far as to uninstall Winamp and all of the plugins. On reinstall, it was the same thing. Any ideas?<br />
      <br />
      here are some sys specs<br />
      <br />
      win xp<br />
      matrox millenium g450 dual head (active)<br />
      athlon xp 1800<br />
      7500 rpm hd<br />
      <br />
      after the problem occured, i tried many settings in the config dialog...none of which seemed to cure the ailment. and it really sux, cuz that el vis stuff is great.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ummm make sure you are using the default winamp setting.<br />
      <br />
      Go to program files/winamp/<br />
      <br />
      and delete the winamp.ini file.<br />
      <br />
      BTW I got your joke in the sig. Geez that film brings back memories.;) It must be 20 years old or so.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey...i haven't spent all this time working on the sex farm for nothing :)...anyway...i found the source of my troubles..partly. i was using the cd player on my computer to play through winamp, so only some of the vis's were working. when i switched over to mp3's, they're all so beautiful.<br />
      <br />
      oh...but the but<br />
      <br />
      so i figured my cd line-in config was wrong. i checked that. it's ticked. but it seems to make no difference, because the cdrom drive on my computer doesn't input through the soundcard...only goes out through the soundcard. my other cd player is independent of the soundcard...so,<br />
      <br />
      is there an input plugin that handles data from the cdrom into winamp? sorry if this has been asked before. all i've found is this question pertaining to cd players routed through the input of the soundcard.<br />
      <br />
      ...and all of this just fry my brain a little bit more...<br />
      you bet<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yes...the CD problem is solved due to a careful browsing of the input plug-ins section.<br />

      And the glove smells as musky and plain black as it ever did. (sound of deep inhalation) aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.</p>
