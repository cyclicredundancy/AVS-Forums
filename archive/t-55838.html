		Okay, here's the thing.<br />
I have a PC running @ 600Mhz with 128MB RAM &amp; an AGP Voodoo 3 card. Now I would have thought that those specs were able to move a few colours round on a screen at a decent resolution and speed. The AVS runs fine when windowed, nice and smooth, but to get the same effect when at fullscreen, I have to take the resolution way down to something like 320x240 for the thing to run at a decent framerate (my default screen size is 1024x768). Any Ideas how I can utilise more of my graphics card or somthing, ANYTHING to make it run fast &amp; smooth at 1024x768?Anyone? <br />
<br />
Cheers guys *&lt;8Â¬B<br />

			<strong>nope..</strong><br />
		
		

		if you want it to run fast at that resolution, you're gonna need one of the new 200ghz (yes, you read correctly and that is not a typo) processors that IBM recently announced it plans to have on the market within 2 years.<br />
<br />
 Okay, so maybe you don't need that much power, but I'd like to know what resolution people are getting out of the athlon 1.4ghz or the pentium 4 1.4ghz processors, I have a sneaking suspicion that it's just not that much better and nowhere near the resolution you're looking for.<br />
<br />
 AVS uses nothing from your graphics card other than to get the image on the screen itself.. I'm not even sure of the importance of RAM because it seems to run equally badly on my Athlon 850 whether I have 64 or 320 megs of ram. <br />
 <br />
 Unless they revise AVS and code it to use your graphics card, I don't see much you can do to get it to run better. I personally formatted my c: drive and re-installed windows. I installed a bare-bones set of programs and drivers to see how much faster I could get AVS to run. It did speed up by about 10fps, so I could run it at 400x300 around 25-30fps, rather than the 15-20 I was getting with windows all cluttered up.<br />
<br />
 Does anyone think this would run better under windows 2000? I've heard good things about it's ram-management, but not much about it's overall efficiency. How fast are others running it, is anyone actually able to run this program in 1024x768at over 10fps? If so, what are you using? <br />

			<strong>mmhmm :(</strong><br />
		
		

		Yea, that's what I was afraid of. But i wish somebody WOULD invent a program like that, like a dedicated studio available from in Winamp which could run AVS using DirectX 3DFX or Glide or somethin. Aah, these dreams...<br />

		Actually, i've made an AVS preset that runs smoothly in 640x480x32, I haven't released it yet though.<br />
But that's on a 1ghz machine. :/<br />
( speed is 25fps though ;) )<br />

			<strong>Is AVS being updated?</strong><br />
		
		

		I wonder if AVS is getting faster with each update- I just got it so I wouldn't know.  Anyone?  If it's being updated, what's the most recent version?

			<strong>I can answer that</strong><br />
		
		

		O.K. so it turns out I have two versions of AVS afterall, 2.3.2 and 2.5, and after testing a couple of presets at the same resolution for each and putting the numbers through microsoft's handy &quot;scientific calculator&quot; AVS 2.5 appears to be between 16 and 25 percent faster than AVS 2.3.2, so maybe it'll eventually get up there.

Do you have a link?

			<strong>Yes, I do</strong><br />
		
		

		Check it out..<br />
<br />
 This isn't the same article I read, it's a bit more detailed even. I made a slight mistake though (either that or it was the way the article I read was written), it's actually a 200GHZ transistor, therefore creating 100GHZ processors within the next few years.<br />
<br />
 here's the link:<br />
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/Press/prnews.nsf/jan/BEBB30C4F4637CCC85256A7600498511" target="_blank">Press Release RE: IBM 100GHZ processor</a> <br />
<br />
<br />
I can't wait.<br />
<br />
 Incidentally, has anyone sen the new Micro Computers? It's a 600mhz-1.2ghz processor, with the whole computer built in and it's just a bit larger than a regular Discman. Check it out, they have a demo at my loca Microbytes(computer store), it hooks up directly to a monitor, and has rca and s-video outputs... This would be my AVS Dream machine.. It's so incredibly small!
