      I know that there are the "holiday dancers" and the "Neo dancer" visualizations and some more, but I think all the vis don't look as good as the avs which is integrated in the real player (it looks like 16 colors, but the movements of the sheep are very cool I think), well but I don't like the realplayer I want to have visualisations like "annabelle the sheep" in :winamp: too<br />
      [if you think I'm just silly, ok but this is my opinion :)]</p>

      <p class="post-content">First off - real player doesn't have AVSs. It has visualizations.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know what "annabelle the sheep" is, but if it's anything like the dancers for winamp, then it can't be done in AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Real ....... HA HA HA</strong><br />
      Hell real's visuals :down: are more primitive than musicmatch. All real lets you do is couple of minor adjustments, while at least mm lets you make visuals (though nothing compared to winamp AVS).<br />
      only good thing about real and mm is they both have recorders which winamp needs</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're not supposed to ask for that :p. Anyways, the latest version is alpha4 or something like that, they are way past the 2nd alpha and the superprealphaleetness thingy. I know some (or maybe all) of the mods have access to the alphas.</p>
