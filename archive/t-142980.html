<div class="posttext">i was thinking that something like a dymanic universal variable thingy would be cool, so you could have &quot;a&quot; always be the same all of the superscopes and dm, ds, and ddm.  One could write something to the tune of &quot;ONBEAT: a=rand(100)&quot; and &quot;a&quot; would always have the same value in each component</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i looked at all five threads in the wishlist, and it wasn't there.  so if anything, you should be bitching out the person who misplaced their thread</div></div><hr />

Here's 7 results for &quot;Global variables&quot; that are all in the AVS wishlist.<br />
There are more than just 5 threads in the wishlist - the forum default is to only show threads from (I believe) the last month.  The rest won't automatically show up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">From the current AVS wishlist<br />
AVS Language Extensions <br />
<br />
XOR, bit-negation and bit-shifting operators (^, ~, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt; ) <br />
<br />
Add built-in constants like pi, 2pi, pi/2, e, ln(2), log2(e), ... into the language. <br />
<br />
Document all functions (missing functions docs: atan2 and exp). Exp would probably not be used a lot, but atan2 is vital for conversion between cartesian and polar coordinates. <br />
<br />
A full blown AVS language including flow control operations (repeat..until, while..do, if..then..else, case..of), commenting (/*..*/, //..CRLF), sub-routine definitions (function cube(x)=x*x*x), additional unary and binary operators (div, mod, shl, shr, inc, dec, etc.). <br />
<br />
Combine all the event boxes (OnInit, OnFrame, etc) into one large syntax highlighting editor in which one would write each part as a subroutine. On top of this, try adding a feature so that AVS points out code errors instead of just choking. <br />
<br />
A small list window showing all the variables used in a component's code (and their values). <br />
<br />
Built-in support for imaginary numbers (you have to write your code to explicitly calculate with the real and imaginary parts of a complex number) <br />
<br />
<br />
Usage and definition of global variables that can be accessed by all components of a preset. <br />
<br />
<br />
A function that returns a real-time clock so that one can synchronize effects regardless of FPS or beat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ah...  interesting... i had absolutely no idea that only five were shown in the forums... i figured that they would have been deleted after being added to the giant wishlist or something...  thanks though</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Within these Forum nothing is deleted, i believe, even Flaming Threads would just be locked, but i've never seen something entirely disappearing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">They do delete threads.  Well actually, now they just move threads to the Evidence Locker forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">not always.  One of ATero's last threads before he was banned was deleted right away, not moved (like when VisAng posted porn)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh, i really never noticed that. Must have been only there for a short time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">glad to see my banning is still such wonderful subject matter :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
i believe i posted this in another thread, but somewhere on these forums there's a sticky about just letting threads die.  this thread has performed it's purpose as a packing peanut for all the important and useful threads in this forum.  now shut the fuck up and let it disintegrate.</div></div><hr />

The wishlist's a sticky anyway... <br />
<br />
... and has not been updated for about a year now. I know i wanted to do this once but seems i never get enough time for that though. Too much to do in RL. :(<br />
<br />
It would'nt be such a hard thing if it had been done regularly but there are approximately 100+ threads to scan through!!!<br />
<br />
Can't someone of those guys who hang around here for 15 hours a day do this please?</div></div><hr />
