      Yes its here,<br />
      Its nothing special, but i took me a looong time to make it:(. I was out of ideas. But i managed to make 20 presets somehow:eek:<br />
      I would like you'll to tell me where i was wrong or what i could improve so that my seventh pack would be much better.<br />
      But i'm still learning so be a little nice.<br />
      You can get it <a href="http://ishan.deviantart.com" target="_blank">here</a><br />
      And let me remind you, the theme is "UNORIGINAL" so please dont expect some very innovative presets.:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not bad. There are some decent presets in there, but there is one thing I cannot stess enough.<br />
      <br />
      INCLUDE NOM-STANDARD APEs AND ANY IMAGES YOU USE.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for shouting, but it ruins the preset if you can see it.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, my favourite was The Triplets.<br />
      <br />
      I found An End With A Beginning distracting because the ceiling and floor move in opposite directions. 'Fraid I can't help with the raytracing though. Just say you meant it to be like that. :p<br />
      <br />
      edit:<br />
      Forgot to say, the presets aren't in order. AVS lists presets in the order the files were created. If you want the intro to show first, write it to disk first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You also used multi-filter, add border, and picture2.<br />
      <br />
      I have a clean install of WA3 for testing purposes. It's handy for finding things like that. It also cost a few people review marks from me.<br />
      <br />
      Like I said before. It's not a bad pack. Some struck me, some didn't.</p>
