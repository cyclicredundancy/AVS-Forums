      <p class="post-content">Sorry but I don't like most of these... they're too flashy and chaotic. Seems like a bunch of random 2D stuff rather than responsive presets. I think some presets manage to cover every one of the 16777216 colors that AVS can display :rolleyes:.<br />
      <br />
      The two SuperOSC's are very cool though, but they need some more filling up.<br />
      <br />
      (btw, writing '10' as ten in your sig kind of ruins the joke, because you lose the binary &lt;-&gt; decimal ambiguity... and in the correct interpretation, writing 10 as ten is completely wrong, because its value is two)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Alright commented on most of these when you first posted them. UnConeD was right about the colors. Also a lot of your DM's are very choppy and some have ugly/warped edges. Also, many of them are barely even remixes. They need a bit more changed before you should put them in a pack of your own.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>finally...almost ready for re-release</strong><br />
      first, don't chew me out for triple-posting. these three messages were posted weeks apart.<br />
      <br />
      and i KNOW that it is Utter Psychosis I now, i zapped the original, it was WAY too n00b-ish.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry, I can't post the APEs- I would have to post way too many times to get them all up...stupid size limits.<br />
      <br />
      here's what you need:<br />
      convolution<br />
      multiplier<br />
      color map<br />
      channel shift<br />
      color reduction (i think)<br />
      texer<br />

      <p class="post-content">Intro: 2/5. Odd color scheme and the DM is too basic. Also I don't like the blur effect.<br />
      <br />
      Blob: 3.5/5. I like the colors here, but again, I think this preset needs a better DM to give more origional movement. Pretty good though.<br />
      <br />
      Colors: 2.5/5. Very basic. I don't really like pattern + DM presets unless they have some origional quality. This one is no exception.<br />
      <br />
      Into The Fire: 4.25/5. I like the colors and the DM in this preset. Very nice.<br />
      <br />
      More Colors: 2.75/5. Too frantic. Work on the texture more.<br />
      <br />
      Radiowaves: 4.75/5. Excellent! By themselves, the BG and Superscope would be dull, but together they look great.<br />
      <br />
      Road RMX: 3.75/5. This looks nice, but I think it could be better with more work.<br />
      <br />
      Road: 4/5. Nice effect, but it could be faster. Still, I like it.<br />
      <br />
      Seashell: 2.75/5. This looks kind of noobish. The scope is good, but the other effects need work.<br />
      <br />
      Sombrero: 4.25/5. I like this one. I don't think the light blur is needed, though. Instead, make the stars darker, as the light blur is pretty slow.<br />
      <br />
      SPH2: 4/5. Pretty good, but could be more vibrant.<br />
      <br />
      SuperOSC RMX: 3.5/5. Looks nice, but boring. Could be much more.<br />
      <br />
      SuperOSC: 4.5/5. Very spiffy. Work to make it faster though.<br />
      <br />
      Vertigo: 3.25/5. This one is okay. Nothing new though.<br />
      <br />
      Whack: 2.75/5. This one looks like it was randomly thrown together. Needs more creativity.<br />
      <br />
      Window On My World: 4.25/5. This one is pretty cool. Just try to achieve a definite color scheme.<br />
      <br />
      Pack Overal: 3.6/5. There are some good ones, but I saw too many dull presets to give you a better rating. Radiowaves is my favorite. My advice: keep making presets, but make each one with a goal in mind. Try to visualize the effect you want to create before getting to work. I'm looking forward to your next release.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, but I reviewed it anyway. What's the big deal? No offense, but you should just be happy that I took the time to review each preset individually. My overall score is the same with or without the intro, by the way.<br />
      <br />
      And for you next pack, I encourage you to actually make a good intro, as I consider it to be very important. After all, it's the first preset you see, so why not make it look appealing?</p>

      <p class="post-content">firstly, can people PLEASE start mentioning whether their presets are zipped in a folder or not. I keep wondering whether it is or not and having to fuck about moving presets about which in turn screws up the order of them.<br />
      <br />
      This is much better, still improvements needed but still much better, on that road remix was it really too much trouble to add a "y=-y" movement :p. Id give it a 4/5 nice job :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">ah hell why not, big ass reviews for all!!!! :D:up:<br />
      <br />
      <b>intro</b> you said dont but tough shit i am anyway :p This one isnt too great but i like the shiny effect in the I, next time put some more work into the intro, it gives the first impression on a pack, you say dont rate it and people might not conciously rate it but subconciously it brings down the quality of the pack. <font color="red">2.6/5.0</font><br />
      <b>radiowaves</b> hmmm, i love those colours and that effect, great idea to move away from the road and turn it into radiowaves and further make it better by making it more technical at the same time. Great preset, i wouldve made the radiotower less of a wireframe and more of a wireframe+, it would take longer but you couldve made the 4 outside lines into cylinders and coloured them into shiny metal to make it more 3d and slick looking. good preset overall. <font color="red">4.3/5.0</font><br />
      <b>blob</b> not that original but i like it, this looks a bit like some of the ones out of the old pack with the colours but the DM is quite nice, nice to see some different types of DM's, its a little didgy at times on the left hand side, you can sometimes see the line where the movement splits. but still not bad. <font color="red">3.7/5.0</font><br />
      <b>colours</b> takes a while to start up and when it does it looks a tad noobish, dont get me wrong it kicks the crap out of most noob presets its just when it starts up. After a bit it looks majorly better though. Shouldve called it trampoline or something like that. This looks more like your old presets though, there are others out of the pack that crap all over this one. The movement sometimes jerks around too much and again youve gone a bit overboard with the colours (despite the name). not too bad but not too good either. <font color="red">3.1/5.0</font><br />
      <b>into the fire</b> hmm, not too bad. The fire and swirling is kind of nice but its a little boring. Maybe the cirlce type thing should move around and maybe add the mife effect after the DM to keep it looking more like fire. The scopes are a bit old school. Add better scopes and make the cirlce moe around and make the fire look a bit more like fire. Not bad but needs work. <font color="red">3.4/5.0</font><br />
      <b>more colours</b> firstly, dont call it more colours, change the background and you have a not bad 2 planes DM. The rotation is a bit crap looking and it jerks around too much. You have the basic idea down though, you just need to sort out the jerking rotation and make it smoother. Also the colours are just clinging to your old style and saying to me that you couldnt be bothered to make a new background for the DM. Getting better, nice DM. <font color="red">3.9/5.0</font><br />
      <b>road broadband cable remix</b> oh god not another one. Nice effect but this has been done and done and done and done again, then forgotten about and done again. I know its just your variation but it dosent take away the fact that its been done and don...... its not bad,looks nice, you couldve just done the y=-y thing but its still quite nice, good colours, easy on the eyes, good job. <font color="red">3.1/5.0</font><br />
      <b>road</b> like i said about the road presets, originality blah blah blah BLAH BLAH. moving on this looks quite nice. It had a crap FPS though and my computer is slow as hell so the road things look like poo, i looked at it on my other comp and it looks nice but you need to compensate for those of us with the wank computers. As for the actual preset, the sky and the "grass" on looks nice, the road looks like the radiowaves thing but with an annoying oscilloscope type thing. Its a little annoying but it isnt too bad. <font color="red">3.1/5.0</font><br />
      <b>seashell</b> meh, a noob preset but with a decent scope, one thing, NEVER say you're going to do something in a later pack. Do it now, it looks like youve put little/no effort into the preset and it lessens its value. Make every preset the best you think it could be or dont release it. The scope is ok but like you say, it needs to be 3d, so instead of releasing, you shouldve worked on making it 3d. The preset is nice looking with the colours but you get those awful AWFUL corner roto blitter lines when it rotated, ugh, those can make anything look noob. This is quite a nice idea but needs a lot of work. <font color="red">3.6/5.0</font><br />
      <b>sombrero</b> excellent nebula, galaxy type preset. The shiny effect with the colours looks sweet and the movement and rotation and morphing looks very nice. You shouldnt of used a starfield though, you should make a custom starfield with a scope and make it match the rotations a little, just so it matches the rest of the preset. This is one of the better ones and it looks awesome but you should add a better starfield. <font color="red">4.0/5.0</font><br />
      <b>sph2</b> wow i love that effect. The colours and the little blobs around the outside look sweet. I just like that averall effect. To make it better you should turn the white bit in the middle into a metablobs type thing, a similar movement to unconeds rybbery metablobs type thing ape. Its a nice effect but again, needs work. <font color="red">3.7/5.0</font><br />
      <b>superosc fire remix</b> meh, superosc with a slightly crappy fire effect, it isnt hard to make that fire much much better, i deleted a couple of things and moved the water to the first item. Ive attatched how much better it looks. <font color="red">3.3/5.0</font><br />
      <b>superosc</b> looks quite nice but you should add more old school effects like a simple but better and basic oscilloscopes and make them look good in a new style or something. Its a nice preset but it needs more happening. <font color="red">3.5/5.0</font><br />
      <b>vertigo</b> hmm, nice shiny effecxt and nice colours, i like it, but i dont like it. The actual effect of it isnt that great. Youve got the nice shine and colours but the effect is irritating. Maybe morph it around and make a sort of swirling DM for it <font color="red">3.2/5.0</font><br />
      <b>whack</b> another nice DM but clinging to that old style of colouring. You need to come up with a better style of putting things in backgrounds of things, with this you couldve done so much more, like for instance something like unconeds retrosquares. Good DM but background needs work. <font color="red">3.8/5.0</font><br />
      <b>window on my world</b> ok firstly the colours on this are really ugly. The starting blue and yellow look awful. Its a nice idea although it couldve been done much much much easier. eg a set render mode, subtractive blend 2, then a scope.<br />
      Init:<br />
      n=800;<br />
      On Beat:<br />
      gx1=((rand(50.0)/50.0)); gy1=((rand(50.0)/50.0));<br />
      Per Frame:<br />
      ax=ax*0.9+gx1*0.1; ay=ay*0.9+gy1*0.1;<br />
      Per Point:<br />
      s=bnot(s)<br />
      x=(i-0.5)+ax;<br />
      y=(s-0.5)+ay;<br />
      <br />
      thats off the top of my head though so dont expect great things from it. Like i said, the colours need work but the idea is nice. <font color="red">3.3/5.0</font><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      quite a nice pack. A great improvement on your last pack, hope to see more soon. Overall <font color="red">3.9/5.0</font> :up:</p>

      lol- i looked at that superscope you suggested, just to see what it did. my younger sister, who also does a little AVS (but her idea of a good preset is 3D tentacles + water) comes in and says "that's AWESOME!! did YOU make THAT?"<br />
