Nah, Tug and fçk (Well, that's the name fsk used in HIS packs...) are just using the fact that this forums is rarely visited, so not too many people would realize that the forumers are turning into drunkards. Besides, their motto is perhaps : &quot;Eat, Sleep, Drink, Watch the pretty colors&quot;<br />
<br />
For now, let the drunkards post (I guess...)</div></div><hr />

imho a short answer with a link to the FAQ <br />
should be enough to guide beginners to the<br />
needed information<br />
(keeping in mind that everyone of us<br />
 had to start somehow a few weeks/month/years ago)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2003, 16:15</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, and I bet that most of us regulars haven't asked questions that are in the FAQ.  Any questions that I have asked I have first searched for in the forums and on google.  Anyone else can do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2003, 20:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">when i joined all i did was show my presets, ive asked about 3 questions in all. Thats because almost every question has been answered already. Am i the only noob that took notice of the search the forums notices plastered everywhere, anubis you dont count cause you already had much coding knowledge?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I got one forum idea too.<br />
To make one sticky where everybody could post their presets and everybody could comment them.<br />
Well when think little then it ist SO great idea, but what do you think of it?<br />
<br />
Bit offtopic but hell with this...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">so what, its better than a big unorganized thread where people are commenting and nobody know whos commenting on what and its all a big mess and the avs presets forum would be deleted and NO is what im trying to say :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd February 2003, 21:39</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Having many threads for many presets is fine.  It's just the pointless threads that are crap.  And Raz, I have also asked questions several times(120-polyhedron for one).  I just happened to search the forums for everything that I could find first, but still couldn't find my answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">EASY FIXED. <br />
a) rescript the php to point people with under 5 posts to a search page that has a new post tucked away in the corner somewhere. <br />
b) rescript the php to point regulars to the Alcoholics anonymous website and dissallow comments like 'I love you man' 'No man I hate you man'...etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yes.  You should enjoy all of your years.  If not, then you are doing something wrong.  You should be able to look back and say that you have had a good time overall.  Small things don't really matter, as long as you are happy overall.  This is what I believe anyway.</div></div><hr />

a) Fuck em all (even the ugly ones, they make the good ones taste better and will give ya something different to think about when your married)<br />
b) Don't drink/smoke hard (I know its cool - until you end up my age and you've only got a hand full of brain cells left)<br />
c) Don't give your teachers too much shit (one of ours died of brain hemerage and came back to haunt us)<br />
d) Remember your mates (later on they'll be more interested in uni, work and their bitch girlfriend)<br />
e) Always do the opposite to advice similar to b), c) and d) because, lets face it, its the best fun you'll ever have!</div></div><hr />
