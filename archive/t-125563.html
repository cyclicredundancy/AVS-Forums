<div class="posttext">This forums not exactly the most active of forums right now so heres some more new stuff by me. A new intro, love the watery effect i got with my name, i havent come up with a decent pack title yet though so it just says &quot;packname&quot;. Another 3d DM, s'gonna be my last plane DM for a while now, work on other areas more. And just a cheap fire effect i put on my cube. Nothing too groundbreaking but here they are. comments blah blah blah, bring em on :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Perception - Needs reactivitity to music and would be nice if it moved in between the planes.  Also runs really slow.<br />
Intro - Try synching your name so it doesn't have holes in the lines and try to make it move about.<br />
Fire - Is this the same effect used on your name?  Kinda boring.  Good effect, but it needs to be a bit more dynamic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Fire: I liked the effect because it looked more like paper burning slowly instead of fire. But there isn't very much to this one.<br />
Intro: I liked how you had the letters fade in.<br />
Perception: Liked it but it got old after a while. It would be nice if you could go into one of the covered areas. Is it possible?<br />
<br />
It was a nice 10 minutes worth of entertainment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">yeah perception needs reactivity, it is possible to go into it but its gonna take a while for me to do it, im not that great with DMs yet, ill work on it though. the coloured bit is reactive to the music though btw but im gonna make a more dynamic background bit for it, thatl do for now. Fires just and effect that i shoved my cube onto, going to make something for it. Intro, meh, just another intro, ive got loads. choose one and develop it more eventually.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Man, take out the first effect list and toss in a picture and Preception goes from 8 fps to 20 for me. :)<br />
<br />
It does need more reactivity to the music though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th February 2003, 03:57</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well ive made the speed react to the music in about 2 minutes, i dont know why i didnt in the first place but i have, im going to make the camera rotation more 3d and work on making it go into the cutout bit thingys, repost when done. cant be bothered right now too late.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Raz, that's definitely different.  If you could make homer move that would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Cooool...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Phaze1987</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th February 2003, 23:06</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">LOL! Great idea haha :) Try to create homer using superscopes...Or do bart! Or cartman ! Ummm...im gonna make a south park preset</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Jaak</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2003, 19:53</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">no no no, use picture, but make his eye dots (u know those black things) of ssc-s, thats bit more simple....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st February 2003, 20:11</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah thats what i thought. Ive got a picture of homer with his head tilted back drooling now though, looks funny which was the idea behind the preset in the first place. I might make some different stuff floating around though like pork chops and beer or something...</div></div><hr />
