      <p class="post-content"><strong>Another way to make a SSC torus</strong><br />
      Got bored at work today and penciled down a way to make a torus. It's slightly faster than Jheriko's Space Torus(I deleted his colorcoding and made n the same), and is kinda neat.<br />
      <br />
      What I did was use 2D polar to make a "side view" of the torus on the x-y plane, and then make z oscillate back and forth. Sure, that's a cheap way of doing it, but it works.:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice. In case you are interested the way in which mine works is pretty simple, I just swept a circle around a point. If you look closely at the code you should be able to see the 2x2 rotation matrix at work in there, along with the shifted parametric equation of a circle. The circle uses one parameter and the rotation uses the other.<br />
      <br />
      Your method is basically the reverse of mine, you took a ring in xy then alter the distance from the centre and the z values to place circles around it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I got that much from your code jheriko, I was just having difficulties figuring out how to do the code to rotate the circle right - I couldn't get myself to think in that way.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Lol, i think you make it sound really fucking complicated, but when i look at the code i see that it's really incredible simple... You guys just love to talk technical, don't you? :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I am bad at explaining these things sometimes - technical is the only way I can get my point across. Maybe I should just post the code and let it do the talking.:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Maybe so that technical way is the one way that everybody understands it, but for me who just type to code and have learned these things by experimenting have no idea what you are talking about when you talk your tech talk :D Anyway, carry on ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The 'technical' way is simply the logical process that leads to the final code, sometimes something really complex will lead to a fairly simple looking result that hides the underlying complexity of the methods used to get there.</p>
