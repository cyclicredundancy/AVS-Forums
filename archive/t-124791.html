		Hello :) <br />
Here`s my version of a dream preset that my last pack should`ve have it but i created it 15 minutes ago so put it in the avs directory remix it delete it do whatever you want.Dont forget to mention about its quality( if(presetnice,good,bad) ) :P<br />
PS.Raz does that ssc look like a ship ? More like a cool H but with some tweaking...

		Don't like the effect much on it. Screwed around for about 2 minutes and came up with this.

		Right first the scope looks kind of like a 2d ship, it looks more like a big H to me. Plus it has bugs, like the lines appearing at points. Not bad but it needs work. I dont like the DM in it either, looks like a barcode, and its too lime green, It looks ok but its too buggy and noob coloured.<br />
<br />
Anubuis, better but i dont like the channel shift, if its going to switch colours it should do smoothly IMO. Not a bad preset both of you but it still needs a lot of work.

		Yeah, I spent 2 minutes. I deleted some crap and added a nice movement.  I would have taken out the channel shift, but I had to get ready for school.  Here's a better one.

		I like Anubis' remix of it more than the orignal. I don't see where &quot;bad dream&quot; come from in yours. I like the ship/h SSC though.

		Nice remixes :) I think i`ll add a DM and include it in a mini pack heh.Anyway i have an idea of a small contest :) Best Valentine`s day preset. Here`s a heart in space with a hole in it (not a good looking heart but it fits my current mood...my girlfriend dumped me for another guys a few days ago).

		You can hardly tell that it is a heart, and I don't see a hole either.  Work on it some more.
