			<strong>Help needed to recover lost files</strong><br />
		
		

		Due to a hard disc crash in my old pc, I have lost all my data. Can everyone search their hard drives and find out if you have installers to my previous preset packs please. Some of you, may have downloaded them way back in 2004. Please post it if you find anything.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
btw. I got a new computer!

		I think <a href="http://www.easeus.com" target="_blank">EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard</a> can help you. Use &quot;Advanced Recovery&quot; function to search and recover your lost data. You can use the demo first.

		As you lost all your data and want your presets back, then you need a data recovery software to get back your presets.<br />
<br />
I had visited many Data Recovery websites and used thier software but I found one <a href="http://www.nucleustechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Data Recovery Software</a> almost excellent.<br />
<br />
To recover your lost data use <br />
<b><a href="http://www.nucleustechnologies.com/FAT-NTFS-Data-Recovery.html" target="_blank">Kernel Recovery for FAT and NTFS</a></b> <br />
<br />
Their support is also excellent you drop a email for any help they will respond within 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
This tool is normally available in DEMO which allows you to preview the recoverable contents and you can check whether the file is recovered correctly or not by double clicking on it.

		Sheyras did you write any new data to the hd after the crash. because if you didn't theres a 70.678909% chance that your data remains. you see when you delete something the computer puts a special set of letters in the name of the file and it is not included in the file allocation table afterwards. but there are ways to get them back. just like the EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard tool. it can reach down and scan the hd in a sector known as sector 0 thats where all the deleted files normally go. but sometimes in your case they would be scattered.

		All I have left.<br />
<br />
And guys, he's asking for presets, not a data recovery tool<br />
<br />
Once I've had my HDD broken in the way of it literally being *broken*. There was no need to even <i>try</i> to recover the data in that case.

		When he said his HDD crashed and he lost all of his data I assumed that he meant it is broken. Since hes a pretty smart fellow I am 99.5% sure that if a data recovery tool would fix it for him he would have already recovered that data, possibly without a tool :P
