<br />
<div class="posttext">You can't.  But you could take a shot of a fullscreen AVS plugin, use it for your background, and take a screenshot of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i'd do that, but the problem is that i want to see it with my icq and all toolbars to have the overlay effect screenshot,<br />
you see my problem here,,<br />
the only way i've though of to get it is to take a real photo of my screen,,<br />
but that costs money!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Okay:<br />
<br />
1. Take screenshot of fullscreen preset.<br />
2. Paste in a program like PSP.<br />
3. Take screenshot of desktop (With blank bg same color as overlay color)<br />
4. Paste desktop shot over AVS shot.<br />
5. Set selection transparency to the overlay color.<br />
6. i iz an jeenyis<br />
<br />
I'm assuming you have experience with this sorta stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Go to www.tucows.com<br />
<br />
download 20-20 screenshot utility (freeware)<br />
<br />
install and run it. This is fully selectable to take screenshots from windows or fullscreen, you can take just the contents of the windows, create slideshows by setting it to take a screenshot at certain time increments and I'm pretty sure the image would turn out better than the one you posted (it's ok, but could be clearer right?<br />
<br />
 All you do is run winamp in overlay mode, press printscreen and it saves a screenshot of the whole screen ..<br />
<br />
 simple, elegant, free...<br />
<br />
<br />
 my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">When I use overlay. I put it in as the second colour (the dark one) in &quot;Appearance&quot;. So that all the borders of my windows and the background in Word etc. are shimmering with colour. It's a much more subtle effect. Nice with a bright, colourful presethttp://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/grinblue.gif.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">If you were to press printscreen with the overlay running, all you would get is the color that you selected where the overlay is.  That was the original problem.<br />
<br />
And I'm assuming the reasons the screenshot is bad are, A- it's resized and B- it's a JPEG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The error of my ways.<br />
<br />
 Actually, this thread led me to try out the overlay mode (which I had up untill now overlooked.. Wow, this is great, just by switching between &quot;view desktop as webpage&quot; and standard desktop (with modified colors for overlay of course) I can have either my regular desktop or Avs,,, I can't believe I was missing out on this..<br />
<br />
 Sorry about the crappy advice.. I thought the screenshot had worked because I had a stagnant avs (no music) as an overlay and it showed up in the screenshot.. but it was simply still overlaying..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Sorry bout that.. I stand (or sit) corrected<br />
<br />
 But thanks for drawing my attention to overlay.. I am in love...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another nice trick would be to leave your background color as it is, and set the overlay to black. Reading a page becomes so much cooler, with all the letters glittering.</div></div><hr />
