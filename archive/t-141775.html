      <p class="post-content"><strong>Time to attach</strong><br />
      Well,i think 1 month passed since i posted a topic here and since i started the work(again...)on my next pack i might as well attach this preset,named Paparazzi(the person who tell me why gets a martini).The preset contains a nice convo filter + brightness filter combo that creates a nice "window" effect(look closely at the starfield...).Its pretty dynamic and nice,but any ideas/remixes are more than welcomed. Thanks in advance!<br />
      <br />
      Required APEs : channel shift and addborders and convolution filter.<br />
      <br />
      edit - pls,instead of s=1 put s=2 in the beat section of the last DM.There was a small mistake there.My bad ! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">BADLY in need of a additive white utone at the end, I couldn't see a damned thing :/ You should probably condense the 2 DM's into one too, and smooth out the transitions. Don't care much for the sinusoidal x/y shift either. And...for the person who was bitching about n00bous DM code, I'd have thought you'd put a constant line (s=2) in the init code. Furthermore I'd have thought you'd have been able to just make that a constant in the frame section :p AND...for the person who had "PLEASE USE THE EDIT BUTTON" in his sig for quite a while...well, I don't think that requires much further explanation :D As for that convo thing...imo it'd be better off with an even x/y blur, but that's just me. In all honesty I think the whole thing would be better off with a big blur after the XORing and a colormap, to reduce grain and cut out the monotone.<br />
      I know I've been ranting about it but it's a nice preset, just not polished very well IMO. Keep working on it :up:<br />
      <br />
      btw, that addborders thing has always bothered me because it wasn't aspect ratio corrected; the borders are squashed with the screen. someone needs to make a new version of it that does it by pixels instead of screen width/height (goebish even ;))</p>

      <p class="post-content">NO :D<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; ul, it'll be released in parts, the first part being the very basics (avsp1 - math tut + avs overview). the second will be coding essentials (math tut++), the third an in depth ssc/dm tut (that i actually had been planning on long before anubis mentioned his), the fourth general tips/tricks (with exerpts from the forums), and then the resource pack.<br />
      <br />
      now, start talking about phazes preset, it's not my thread :p<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; that sig is huge ul, read the forum rules</p>
