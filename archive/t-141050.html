<div class="posttext">Here's a pretty firey preset.  Any advice would be great, but before I submit it I have question.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when you use a bump, all the black pixels aren't completely affected by it, causing rough, sharp edges on the render object, which doesn't exactly look good.  Is there any way to fix this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No offense, but this doesn't look very 'firey' to me.  It is too busy and hard to see what is going on.<br />
<br />
On the techincal side:<br />
<br />
SSC:<br />
Init:<br />
n=80;t=0.0;<br />
Remove t=0.0.  It is redundant.<br />
Add p9=acos(-1)*9.  acos(-1) is equal to pi, so is much more accurate than writing it out.<br />
<br />
Per point:<br />
<br />
r=i*3.14159*9;<br />
Repalce &quot;3.14159*9&quot; with p9.  Because we calculated acos(-1)*9 in init, it is not calculated again, saving you 80 calculations per frame.  While this is not important now, it will help once you make more and more complex presets.<br />
<br />
d=sin(r*0)+v*0.5;<br />
Remove sin(r*0).  When you multiply anything by 0, it is zero.  The sine of 0 is also 0.  Doing this saves you 160 calculations every frame.  Again, it is not important now, but helps in the long run.<br />
<br />
The rest of the SSC is fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the bump, you have<br />
Frame:<br />
<br />
<br />
x=0.5+0*0.3;<br />
y=0.5+0*0.3;<br />
t=t+0.1;<br />
<br />
You never use t, so there is no need to have it.  Also, you have numbers multiplying by 0 again.  Remove the +0*.3 in the x and y calculations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Like m^2k was saying - make sure you OPTIMIZE - it makes your code faster(esp. when you have useless functions, such as sin,cos,tan,etc) and easier to read.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by the bump - it only does a certain area surrounding the bump location, so anything outside of that circle will not be affected.  I also don't think that it modifies purely black pixels, but if the color has the slightest color(even if it's not noticable - such as RGB 0,0,1), it may apply the bump to it.  I'm not sure about that, but I think that may be what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />
