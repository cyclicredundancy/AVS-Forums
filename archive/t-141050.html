      <p class="post-content"><strong>New Preset</strong><br />
      Here's a pretty <font color="orangered">firey</font> preset. Any advice would be great, but before I submit it I have question.<br />
      <br />
      Sometimes when you use a bump, all the black pixels aren't completely affected by it, causing rough, sharp edges on the render object, which doesn't exactly look good. Is there any way to fix this?</p>

      <p class="post-content">No offense, but this doesn't look very 'firey' to me. It is too busy and hard to see what is going on.<br />
      <br />
      On the techincal side:<br />
      <br />
      SSC:<br />
      Init:<br />
      <b>n=80;t=0.0;</b><br />
      Remove t=0.0. It is redundant.<br />
      Add p9=acos(-1)*9. acos(-1) is equal to pi, so is much more accurate than writing it out.<br />
      <br />
      Per point:<br />
      <br />
      <b>r=i*3.14159*9;</b><br />
      Repalce "3.14159*9" with p9. Because we calculated acos(-1)*9 in init, it is not calculated again, saving you 80 calculations per frame. While this is not important now, it will help once you make more and more complex presets.<br />
      <br />
      <b>d=sin(r*0)+v*0.5;</b><br />
      Remove sin(r*0). When you multiply anything by 0, it is zero. The sine of 0 is also 0. Doing this saves you 160 calculations every frame. Again, it is not important now, but helps in the long run.<br />
      <br />
      The rest of the SSC is fine.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In the bump, you have<br />
      Frame:<br />
      <br />
      <b><br />
      x=0.5+0*0.3;<br />
      y=0.5+0*0.3;<br />
      t=t+0.1;<br /></b><br />
      You never use t, so there is no need to have it. Also, you have numbers multiplying by 0 again. Remove the +0*.3 in the x and y calculations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Like m^2k was saying - make sure you OPTIMIZE - it makes your code faster(esp. when you have useless functions, such as sin,cos,tan,etc) and easier to read.<br />
      <br />
      I'm not exactly sure what you mean by the bump - it only does a certain area surrounding the bump location, so anything outside of that circle will not be affected. I also don't think that it modifies purely black pixels, but if the color has the slightest color(even if it's not noticable - such as RGB 0,0,1), it may apply the bump to it. I'm not sure about that, but I think that may be what you are talking about.</p>
