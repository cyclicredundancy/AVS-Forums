      <p class="post-content">Ahh, so you're interested in avs. Isn't that nice. We all are. Unfortunately, we all hate rips too, especially as poor as this one. Adding a DM and Fyrewurx to a well known preset, does not a good preset make.<br />
      <br />
      Use your own code. If you can't code, experiment with the effects that don't require it until you're satisfied. If you HAVE to use a piece of code someone else made, credit him/her in the comment. Again, taking someone's preset, and making it uglier isn't what one would call acceptable behaviour.<br />
      <br />
      If you really like AVS that much, heed what I say. Trust me, you're more likely to get a positive response if you do everything yourself, even if it's crappy, that you are with something like this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">God, that's a total rip off. It was way better before. Look no offence guy, but it just doesn’t work. I know that maybe you tried so hard and you were so excited to post this but it just doesn’t work.<br />
      <br />
      I know that because once I was the same, when I was really small in experience, I used one of Tuggummi's presets to do a remix. I was really excited to post it and to see what everyone would think of it and of course everyone realized that it was a rip off.<br />
      <br />
      I felt really bad but I keep on trying and after 6 months of trying I submitted one pack, my first one and it was rated with 3.5 out of 5. After I found out, I was happy and you know why, because I didn't used other's work.<br />
      <br />
      My advice: keep on trying and you will see how happy you will be after you’ll do you’re own work.</p>
