<div class="posttext">Hey, before this start, let's make it clear : i'm not totally sure if such a request had already been made. So don't blame me if that's not the first thread about this, thanx.<br />
Anyway, I now happen to have just dozens of AVS(es), just cause it's freakin good. But, one or two of those makes winamp crash.<br />
I tried to brownse through all presets to determine whiwh ones are really bad, but that's a long work. I mostly use AVS with a random selection mode, so from time to time Winamp just stop (sometimes, there isn't even the Windows error screen).<br />
So, i'm asking for a new feature in AVS : a log file, where winamp writes a txt of what it is about to load next, then load it. So, if Winamp crash, you know what's wrong and can delete the preset.<br />
<br />
Does such a thing already exists or..?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I don't think such a tool exists... though AVS is known to crash at rare occasions, and then this is usually not the fault of the preset. Only if a preset crashes consistently should you delete the preset itself.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you will have to wait for the next version, sorry. AVS 2.7pre (somewhere around the forums) is not too stable though, so 2.6/2.6.1 is the best option now;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Oh.. I'm using AVS 5.4.1 so, it might be an answer to my problem. I'm sure a few of my presets are faulty (winamp crash as soon as those are manually selected, whatever you do).<br />
I though the studio.ini kept trace of the last preset but it isn't accurate.. Must be for another use.<br />
<br />
Wait.. You're UnConeD ? I got a few of your packs, I just love them. Keep up the good work !</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS 5.4.1?  Was that typo or do you have something we don't? A log file could be useful if it also logged things like hangups in your coding, (ie-too many variables, bad parenthesis, etc..)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Did i wrote &quot;5.1.4&quot; ?<br />
*checks*<br />
Woops, now that's a typo.<br />
It's actually 2.5.something. On one of my PC winamp crashes instantly when i open it, so i can't check right now (no worry, i know how to fix this, it's only a corrupted file at the top of my list)</div></div><hr />
