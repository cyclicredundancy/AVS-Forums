<div class="posttext">Firstly, welcome to winamp forums and avs.<br />
<br />
Lets see then... I'm going to warn you, get ready for some critisism, these presets are pretty bad, even for noob presets.<br />
<br />
Simple: Yes, Blue: No.<br />
<br />
Anyway it seems as though you have managed to make 49 unreactive and virtually identical presets. Here is my advice on how to make something much better.<br />
<br />
1.) Dot grid isn't all that there is to AVS. Don't use it to much since it is unreactive, which brings me to...<br />
<br />
2.) Reacting to the music is what AVS is all about, presets should do something to music, even if it only simple on beat reactivity or including an oscilloscope.<br />
<br />
3.) Code like &quot;d=d*y;r=x*t&quot; (simple 11) will do nothing unless you make t do something, you may as well type &quot;d=d*y;r=0;&quot; because that is what that code does if you do nothing to make t do something in the first place.<br />
<br />
4.) Code like &quot;d=d*d;&quot; is appropriate for the Dyanmic Distance Modifier and not the Dynamic Movement, this is because the DDM is designed for altering d and nothing else, using a DM will make this look uglier, due to the grid, and slower, due to the fact that DM is designed for doing more than that.<br />
<br />
5.) Don't steal code. You can tell when someone steals code because they use it incorrectly. In fact the code that you stole (god knows where from) is pretty useless for the most part.<br />
<br />
6.) Learn to code. If you had a better understanding of the coding process then you could make reactive presets and more original presets.<br />
<br />
7.) Don't post up 49 presets that all look the same, it is annoying, especially when you get to preset 49 and realise that you have just wasted 10 minutes by expecting something good to be around the corner.<br />
<br />
8.) Download presets by other people and rip them apart to understand how they work, also do this to the ones that came with winamp. This way you can learn for yourself how to do things. You will also get a better idea of what the expected standard is for AVS presets and what makes them look good.<br />
<br />
I would write a huge code tutorial but this post is already quite huge so I'll post some links to good threads instead:<br />

Also look in the FAQ, there are quite a few links to good threads in there too.<br />

As a final thing, here is one of my first presets which uses a green dot grid as the main component.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Go easy on him, jheriko, he's new here.<br />
What code are you referring to that you think is 'stolen'?<br />
<br />
I agree on four things:<br />
Learn to code<br />
Don't post 50 presets that all look alike<br />
Make your presets reactive somehow<br />
Don't use the same thing over and over again<br />
<br />
But don't listen to jheriko when he starts whining about the built-in render effects (he gets kinda bitchy when it comes to making everything coded all the time every time)<br />
<br />
Seriously, jheriko, that 'code is everything' attitude of yours is really starting to get on my nerves :hang:</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, jheriko, what's up with that?, the &quot;old renders&quot; are good if you know how to use them, the superscope &amp; the dm isn't everything, avs is so much much more than the superscope &amp; the dm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">When did i say that all of avs is the ssc and dm?<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe its just because I am a coder but I think that 80% of any really good effect is going to be code, even if it is simple code.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is the nearest I've come to saying it I think.<br />
<br />
Besides that if it wasn't for the custom codable elements would AVS be worth bothering with? Yes you can make some good presets without using any code but they are always going to be one out of a limited number of possibilities.<br />
<br />
I like a lot of other render effects too, not just SSC. Like the moving particle or the picture, but lets face it, most of them are crap, things like render/simple and render/ring are useful but not very customisable, dot fountain and dot plane can be spotted even through 50 trans effects and things like timescope are just plain useless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No-one said that you shouldn't use ANY coding, the only thing said was that nobody should base a preset upon coding alone. Take UnConeD's neoncoaster for instance. The SSC is huge, but that's all the preset is. :igor:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ratta: Believe me, if it was possible to synchronize anything else to that rollercoaster without having it go at a crawling speed, I would've. Still think it's a neat preset though :).</div></div><hr />

Im no expert on how computers work.. But when Justin coded AVS why didnt he implement 3D hardware into it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">a) 3D hardware acceleration only works if you go all the way. Doing stuff on the CPU means you have to drag the image from video RAM to system RAM and back, which is slow. Not all AVS effects can be done in hardware.<br />
<br />
b) AVS is at version 2.5. When it was initially started, 3D hardware acceleration was not as popular as it is now. Remember it was initially non-MMX as well.<br />
<br />
c) Maybe they didn't expect people to come up with such complicated effects.</div></div><hr />
