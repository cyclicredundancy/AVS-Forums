      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hello...</strong><br />
      I'm just gonna do some intro before I show something awful (to quote the title of a pretty good comic) of my avs files:<br />
      <br />
      I'm 23, I've been experimenting with the AVS since I was... I dunno, 13? Does AVS exist since 10 years...? Well, I downloaded Winamp at some point and some later point, I discovered AVS. Been making presets since then, if I remember it right.<br />
      And since about 2007, I paint "real", non-animated pictures in oil, gouache, tempera, acrylics... whatever I feel like.<br />
      <br />
      OK, here goes nothing...<br />
      <br />
      Maybe you can have fun with it...? And experiment? ...I just noticed I forgot to add comments to the presets...</p>

      <p class="post-content">2 new people in one day, what's going on with that?<br />
      <br />
      Hello and welcome.<br />
      <br />
      2 remixes and an original, right? Okay.<br />
      My brain can't find the original of p-k - bumpy right now. (Though I do recognise it.) so I'll skip that one, since I can't really compare it to the original.<br />
      <br />
      MIB4u - yathosho - sakura.avs -- well not too much of a difference really, it's just the addition of a colour fade and two mosaics on the end. Not particularly original or interesting changes. Sorry.<br />
      <br />
      MIB4u - simple minds.avs -- Okay now I can tell this is self made.<br />
      You probably won't like this but it's basically a stereotypical preset a beginner would make, back when AVS first came out.<br />
      <br />
      What I recommend for you is to go and download some decent AVS packs, watch them, pick them apart and learn from them.<br />
      Also go read the stickies in the main AVS section here.<br />
      <br />
      You can add comments via + -&gt; Misc -&gt; Comment btw.<br />
      <br />
      I hope that negatively doesn't put you off AVS.</p>
