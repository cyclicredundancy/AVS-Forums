<div class="posttext">I really like this preset!:D  It's really not finished, but the effects might need work.  Any sugguestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">cool indeed but when it first came up a part of the ssc was off to the side... It would be really cool if you could get that little part to move around and stuff... its very repetative though<br />
<br />
it would improve it if you turn on clear every frame under main, turn it off in the effect list and slap slight fade out in it.<br />
actually... you could probably leave the Main one alone....<br />
thats my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hmm...i've seen a lot of n00bish presets but this one stands out because it actually looks relatively good.  the scope and dm are (or at least look) random, and if they aren't then you really need to get a handle on your coding and maths.  it's also completely unreactive (i know you've got some onbeat stuff going on but as far as i can tell it doesn't do anything).  but aesthetically you (seem to) know what you're doing.  as far as i'm concerned on the trans side of this preset the only thing it needs is some color variation (and less monotone).  keep up the good work aestheticswise, but get some coding/trig knowhow as well.  i can see you developing into a helluvan avser if you just got a handle on making things purposefully ;) hope to see some more presets out of you in the future<br />
<br />
cheers :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Blue... mmmmmm ... Anything that's blue is cool, I say you should work some more on the coding aspects but you have a pretty good base to work from, and I like the colors.<br />
