			<strong>Resizing the visualization window</strong><br />
		
		

		When I first downloaded Winamp, the visualization window was a normal size. Then somehow when I opened Winamp one day, the height of the window was a lot less. For some reason I can't resize it, even when I try it with a different visualization plugin. Right now I'm using the MilkDrop plugin, and I have Winamp v5.08. <br />
<br />
I've searched the forums and I can't find an answer to this. I really hope someone can help me.

		Yes, I have tried that, and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input though.

		Could you by chance have it docked in the AVS editor? That's all I can think of. If you can't figure it out, you might need to reinstall Winamp. And don't feel bad about it, I've had to do so 21 times already. :p

		Ooh, that was actually something I hadn't tried, but it didn't work. I think I will just have to reinstall. Thanks, though!

		Is this problem still there with classic skins?<br />
<br />
If so, try enabling 'enable smooth window resizing for resizable skinned windows' in the preferences&gt;skins&gt;classic skins menu.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how this would be with modern skins because I haven't installed modern skin support. (due to speed losses with AVS) Might be the same. dunno.

		That's a good idea...I tried it, but no dice. I am doomed to reinstalling, heh.
