      <p class="post-content"><strong>Installation problems with visualizations</strong><br />
      I've tried to install Mindscapes and Cherno Belia a few times and they do not show up in my list of visualizations. I have installed R4 with no problems, but these do not want to install. They are in "Program Files", but are not in the list where I need them. A little help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      btw...yes I searched first, but had no direct hits.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mindscapes is not a seperate plugin, it's a set of presets for AVS.<br />
      Open AVS (the default plugin), rightclick on the window and select it in that list.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know about Cherno Belia, but I suppose it's also a set of AVS presets. If so, it should also show up in the list of AVS presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, Cherno is a set of presets. I was assuming they are plug ins like Milkdrop or R4.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can you not make your set be a stand alone like Milk Drop or R4? If I want to random through your set, I have to random through all of the AVS presets and won't really know what's yours or someone elses. This is why I don't use the AVS presets.</p>

      </blockquote>No i cannot make it a standalone plugin. BUT YOU can make it randomly switch only my presets, you just have to know how. its dead easy in fact, so don't dislike AVS for this, beacuse it is able to do it. just go to the avs editor, click settings, choose presets/hotkeys, and choose my pack in the "preset (sub) directory to use for random/cycle" menu section.
