<div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
I found little meaningful information in the forums concerning Windows multi-screen modes.<br />
Background:<br />
I would invest some money to buy a graphic card with multi-screen support, if iÂ´d only knew if the following would run:<br />
<br />
1. AVS with 320x240 (overlay) one one screen (has acceptable quality on my Pentium III with single-screen AGP graphics card wich I use right now) <br />
2. &quot;Rest of Windows&quot; and Winamp-control menues on the second screen.<br />
<br />
- Will that work at all? or is this so trivial, that nobody ever mentioned it:o .<br />
- Has anybody made the test yet: How does this behave speedwise?<br />
<br />
Thanks for giving some advise</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm not sure what your mean by 320x240, but you can run AVS in overlay mode on your Primary monitor and run Winamp (and other programs) on your Secondary. However, I find it rather annoying to run winamp in the secodary monitor as other programs, dialog boxes, and the start bar tend to default to running in the primary. That means you have to either manually move (drag) everything over to the secondary, or buy a vid card (such as nvidia) that has software that can control window position.<br />
<br />
IMHO, MilkDrop is the best vis to use for multi-monitor set-ups as it allows you to set which monitor you want to display the vis in without the need for extra software. That option works in full screen &amp; overlay mode. It also has a VJ mode that ou can use to control the Vis in realtime.<br />
<br />
AVS would benefit is it had the option to control which monitor to display in. I my specific application, AVS will not work because it lacks that feature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah, like what he said. It'll work in overlay mode on whatever is the primary display. You have to move things to the secondary display. Just don't change your setup after you get it working and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />
