      I understand that whoever took the time to make AVS really worked hard, but it simply is crap. If I had to choose between using AVS or eating poop, I'd eat the poop. Why? You may ask... Well jesus. I think we all know why. *We all don't have 1.8ghz processors!* If you want the plugin to look cool it has to be large such as fullscreen, but in AVS the only fullscreen resolution that looks good is 2x4! Well, more like 300x400 but it's still crap so you use the "Pixel Doubling" configuration option, then it looks like a mosaic effect constantly! It's a never ending cycle. I like the idea, but if you want to make it better totally recode it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">so what you cant run every vis fullscreen?<br />
      that dosnt mean you cant enjoy all the hard work that people like The All Mighty Justin, Steve, Tom, PP, Mike, Bilbo, Brennan, Tag, Susan, there are yoo many to name, 39fps, Jason, Ian, Jake, Chev, i can go on for hours naming all the people who have contributed to the perfection of Winamp not to mention all the thousands of people who made the skins and plugins (including me, so when you crap on the presets, youre crapping on ppls hard work) you take for granted each and every day. plus alll the hard working aol execs :rolleyes: i think you should recode your attitude.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I use AVS in a club on over 100 Screens and 4 mamoth Projectors. I have been using AVS for over a year.<br />
      <br />
      If you experiment enough and learn the art of improvisation AVS is still damn awesome(even with all its limitations, you still learn what will still look great on the big screen)<br />
      <br />
      I come to winamp.com on a weekly basis and download every singe new preset pack available. I then go through each and everyone of them and keep the ones that will look great overlayed on top of my LOGO graphics or AVIs'.<br />
      <br />
      The presets i keep and use are so cherished i back them up constantly. If i were to ever lose them all, id freak out, as i have spent 100s of hours sorting through the best ones that might suit my purposes, not to mention the hundreds of re-edited presets containing a lot of my own work.<br />
      <br />
      To all the preset makers... you guys are really amazing. The only reason i dont dedicate lots of time in creating my own is that i just know they won't be half as good as the BEST ones i download from here.<br />
      <br />
      Cant express how much i love the product... everything is improvisation dudes... learn it and V.J away like happy little vegimites:)<br />
      <br />
      Of course a completely re-coded version using your GeForce 3 would rock, and i've always suspected that the nulsoft developing team have probably already made such a version but keep it all to themselves to be used in some crazy raves around the world. I know i would have by now:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you spend, err I mean waste your time making avs plugins all day that's pretty pathetic. And you're talking about all this "Hard Work" into making presets. No offense, there isn't much skill to it. People just rip of people movment presets add water and some moving particles and say they spent long hard tiime making presets!<br />
      If you have fun looking at pretty colors at an extreemly low resoulution go on with your bad self. But don't try to flame me because your ass thinks it takes large amounts of skill to make a few presets.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Don't diss AVS since you're also dissing my hard work creating good-quality AVS Presets! Sure making plug-ins with C++ igives you better results, but making AVS, believe me, is hard work, since there's lots of variables that you'd ought to get right in order for the preset to be high quality! As I have compared with Sonique's Visuals (Which Winamp AVS also supports), Winamp AVS is 1000× better! To me, AVS is the plug-in I use the most! The Winamp plugin which I would bitch at is MP3CUE! So STFU, SnikAhz, or I'll bag ya really good! :D AVS possibilities are endless! Anyway, that's my professional critique of the day, which could probably make it my 632nd during the entire time I used computers! :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">You don't have to get all hostile. Is scarface2k1 plugging his AVS pack or somthing? Anywho, there's a difference between "hard work" and doing somthing over and over again, like making 1000s of usless presets. If you make plugins all by themselves thats another story but just making presets for a plugin is pathetic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS is a good plug-in, in which you can do very good looking presets. It has some weakness, but most of you do not care or know how to ignore/change them...<br />
      <br />
      A quick question to all AVS zealots out there..<br />
      I used AVS for some weeks too.. on big TV and/or video projectors for partys/events.<br />
      People who never saw something like that before where pleased and astonished. But overall the response from my audience/friends/guests was not that good. The plug-in before AVS was Geiss, which some of you might know. Most of them liked Geiss more. The said it was more responsive to music, faster, more furious and so on.<br />
      <br />
      Now to my point: Does anyone here have tried Milkdrop? It is in my view the best plug-in ever created, fast, responsive.. It is now my favourite plug-in for partys. And you can create your own presets like in AVS.<br />
      Besides, Milkdrop is from Ryan Geiss, the same author who created Geiss and Drempels.<br />

      <p class="post-content">According to me GEISS is NOT faster than AVS, it's just a matter of what you use. I am able to, and I have made a preset that has a speed GREATER than the speed of GEISS, and has a look that is close to exactly the same.<br />
      Milkdrop, I agree that it CAN be better, but you CAN NOT modify scopes, movement size, ect, in the simple way that it can be done in AVS, therefore I find AVS BETTER THAN BOTH GEISS AND MILKDROP, due to speed and functionality/freedom.<br />
      Sure, you could make 3d movements in milkdrop, but it is so much harder because you would have to klick enter after every change you made to check if it's correct.<br />
      I myself belive that an AVS that uses Hardware acceleration will be possible in winamp 3, but I don't think that it will come in W2.<br />
      As for you SnikASS, If you don't like the SHIT WE DO, Then KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF, It's just PLAIN STUPID to come and bitch us about it, no-one here will ever like you for saying that stuff, if you find it pathetic that we like AVS then fuck off, AVS CAN do anything Milkdrop or GEISS, or any other visualization can, AND MORE!<br />

      I agree this guy is good. The presets rock. I'm just trying to say they would rock even more if it would run faster at higher resolutions. And whoever is talking about "we don't care what you think!" if you don't care about what I think don't even respond to my posts... Thank you.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>It will come.</strong><br />
      Well,<br />
      <br />
      For now it's useless to argue aboput it. If youwant the good framerates with AVS you need the good processor. I know i wasn't really interested in AVS on my pentium 166, but when I bought the Athlon 850, it became more workable. The resolution itself is kind of decieving, you can stil get some really remarkable effects at 320x240 fullscreen mode.<br />
      <br />
      I think mostly it's us, the guys making the presets who are to blame, but we're all learning.<br />
      <br />
      There's just not really much of a reply to something titled "I'd just like to say that Avs sucks", cool, thanks for your input, carry on. Most of us here are interested about learning more about making presets andmaking better presets, so I really can't see the reason for your post in the first place. It's not like we're all going to break down in tears in front of our computers and have hysterial fits screaming "It's all meaningless" into the still night air (well, okay, but it was only for live five minutes, okay?) . Hehehe<br />
      <br />
      That's about it, If you're looking for faster 3d plugins, I'd personally recommend milk drop or kata fx. Don't think that any of us are exclusive to AVS, I'm pretty sure we all check out other stuff that's available. But you must admit that for the average non c++ knowing joe, AVS is the best option. At least untill we get off our lazy arses and learn c++<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, that's my 2 cents</p>

      <p class="post-content">I use Celeron 300A, and I don't care about speed very much, you know why, because, the AVS window is resizable, and if I don't do that, I doubleclick on the window, and than again on the black space in it(yes that's what it's for), and eventually it'll run smoothly. And why are you complaining about everyone being hostile, you were hostile, you started it, what did you expect that everybody'll be nice and friendly toward you !?!?!?!?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah...Giess and Mildrop are awesome. A pure coded plugin will kill AVS any day, because it doesn't have to have as much wasted coding!! The only thing that pisses me off about AVS is the fact that most try to slip them in with regular plugins by not stating in the title that they are AVS. Thus alot of people don't know about MILKDROP and GEISS.<br />
      <br />
      If I was having a party..I wouldn't even bring up AVS. You can't wow 'em with that old news. But for some they enjoy it..so enjoy. JUST LABEL YOUR DAMN CREATIONS AS AVS!!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>In defense of.....</strong><br />
      Oh, I dunno. I seem to be able to get decent speeds with a 350 mhz, pentium II processor with 128 RAM. You just need to have patience with tweaking.<br />
      <br />
      I run it at 320 x 200 with 55% of the screen. Admittedly, its low-rez and only takes up a bit more than half the screen. Its still enough, in my opinion, to be impressive.<br />
      <br />
      And, while other presets are of course prettier, AVS makes up for it in two ways:<br />
      1: the sheer volume of presets available.<br />
      2: Above all, beat detection. While other plugins simply react to the beat, AVS is predictive with some stunning results. (there is an exception, I noticed one recent plug-in does have beat-detection, but rather than being automatic, it has you set it yourself).<br />
      <br />
      My 2 cents'<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>im with you Snikahz</strong><br />
      they really need to recode it. You guys really enjoy viewing moving 8x8 pixels? Well, i don't :)<br />
      I have a p3 800 with 512 ram and a tweaked 64 ddr vivo card and it still stutters at 640x480 16Bit, which I found pretty abnormal for my system who can run 3d games faster than this plugin :)<br />
      <br />
      anyways, looks like a lot of you guys enjoy it, so I'll just hope someone will code a better "AVS-like" plug-in<br />

      <p class="post-content">I was just playing around with AVS in the 2.77 and under fullscreen I notice an overlay option... So I click it and set the resolution to like 400x300 or whatever and have pixel doubling on. So I click "GO" and suprisingly I get really good FPS. Really good being like 40 or so. Keep up the good work.</p>
