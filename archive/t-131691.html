      <p class="post-content">agch, bright colours. Reminds me of beetlejuice (the really old weird film). I don't like the jerky movements and the ugly edges are plainly visible. Try and alpha blend them. Tone down the colours a little, they pain my eyes. The squares look good though. Don't get me wrong the hexagonal tunnel thing looks great, it just needs a little work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">you might want to do a x=d*cos(r); y=d*sin(r); right before everything else in the pixel section of the dm, it makes the sides stay in the correct ratio :)<br />
      <br />
      other than that, the texture is pretty cool, but as Raz said, you might want to try and fog the intersections of the panels a bit to hide the squigglyness of the raytrace :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Indeed, the bright colours, must get rid of them...<br />
      the dm-s and alphablending have been my weakest parts, i suck at doing them... i haven't got even a clue how to blend the ugly edges...<br />
      Thanks of tip Moltarx</p>

      <p class="post-content">omg...this is sweet XD<br />
      it seems to stretch tho...and the texture needs to be more dynamic.../me will never quit bitching about undynamic presets, get used to it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What wrong with Beatlejuice Raz? You're right though.<br />
      <br />
      I'm liking it, except the edges. You might be able to make nicer edges if you use 3 DMS and blend out the ones you don't use.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty sweet tunnel and original texture, but im sure the texture can be done a lot faster by using movement &amp; superscope together. As i think of it im sure it can be done by using 2 superscopes &amp; 2 movements... Though the way i would do it would mean they are mono colored :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Shreyas here's new one with your ape ;)<br />
      it doesnt look so nice with this fog, im still working on it...<br />
      I have one question too:<br />
      What if i want to fog the ugly eges differently than the fog for masking the ugl *** back of the tunnel. Like the ugly edges with somekind of fancy stuff, and the back of the tunnel with just one color.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just do a test for how far back you are looking, if its past a certain point, work in the distance fog for the end of the tunnel, otherwise, fog the edges. I have an example i could post if you like :)</p>
