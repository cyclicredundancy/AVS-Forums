<div class="posttext">Hello, all. I've been working to put up a site with Winamp AVS tutorials as an independent study for my high school. The intent of this site (at least for now) is to provide the basics of the Winamp AVS (with an emphasis on the math of the Superscope, currently). I hope to make this site a good starting point for those interested in the AVS, but without any idea how to go about making presets (a good grasp on high school level math is also recommended). It's currently online at http://www.xoasis.com/~soulcatalyst/ . <br />
<br />
So, for those interested in the basics, please check out the site. And for those who know more than that (especially those who know more than me), please check out the site, and recommend changes or additions that you would like to see. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">There's mine, and UnConeD's (in the AVS forum), but I don't think I want mine being distributed off of Winamp.com yet.  You'll have to talk to UnConeD about his stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I'll check those out, Atero. I just dl'ed your primer from your forum post this morning. It's looking great, and should be very helpful. I was going to ask you about putting it on my site, but you've mentioned that you'd rather not have it distributed elsewhere, so I will certainly respect that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">So there's more people than I thought working on tutorials (and interestingly enough, you're all using different methods).  Sigh--I don't forsee that I'll be able to put my tutorial on my own website; the best I was hoping for was to have a zipped word document explaining primarily different ideas on how to use the different objects in AVS.  My primary theme is just different uses of objects, like superscopes, so that the person reading it gets a more comprehensive understanding of how to use the different objects.  Whenever you get your website ready, I'll check it out.  BTW:  I'm in high-school, too.  For my Algebra class project, I did Winamp AVS-and it was really cool.<br />
<br />
Peace everyone!!!<br />

cmountford: Why dont you make those threads as links in your sig?<br />

Something like this:<br />

Just replace the &lt; &amp; &gt; with [ &amp; ] and it'll look like this.<br />

<div class="posttext">I think a simple glossary would be great for such a site.  You could explain what stuff does like &quot;Trans&gt;Bump&quot;, &quot;Trans&gt;Interleave&quot; &amp; &quot;Trans&gt;Roto Blitter&quot;.  I believe this would greatly accelerate the learning curve.  I am still working on what they do right now.</div></div><hr />

Linus wrote a tutorial last summer and I created a site where it was placed. Maybe you'll get some ideas for your project.

do you know some helpful links?<br />
i don't understand the superscopoe and movement functions yet (3d etc.), but i like to use superscope for visuals with linked tetraeder bodys. <br />
here you'll find my latest avs presets! (http://the.nationalcrisis.de/downloads/avs.zip)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looks like you know your way around an AVS window. :up: If you do use someone else's work though, be sure to give them credit.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't think you'll find any superscope specific 3d tutorials. Just find a regular one and apply it to the superscope. The math doesn't change.<br />
<br />
The hard part of 3D is figuring out the equation to make your scope look the way you want.<br />

I'll try YaPoNDeeZzZzz..'s advice to get rid of mine (thanks man but could you please be more specific: just &lt;noembed&gt;? And where exactly in the code?) Help appreciated. Soulcatalyst, go ahead and put up the link to my site. Can I do the same with your's? Maybe it'll be e start of a tutorial site community...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I checked out your site again...I think the functions page needs to be a bit more in depth.  Just saying that &quot;sin(x)&quot; calculates the sine of x doesn't really help to understand what it does.  That goes for the logarithmic functions as well.  And e and pi DO go on infinitely - they're called irrational numbers.<br />
<br />
Now, as for the functions:<br />
sign(a) - returns 1 if a is positive or -1 if a is negative<br />
min(a,b) - returns the lesser of a and b<br />
max(a,b) - returns the greater of a and b<br />
sigmoid(a,b) - not sure exactly how this is derived, but it helps to graph it<br />
rand(a) - returns a random integer between a and 0, including 0 and a<br />
band(a,b) - returns 1 if both a and b != 0<br />
bor(a,b) - returns 1 if either a or b != 0<br />
bnot(a) - returns 1 if a == 0 and 0 otherwise<br />
if(a,b,c) - returns c if a == 0 and b otherwise<br />
equal(a,b) - returns 1 if a == b and 0 otherwise<br />
above(a,b) - returns 1 if a &gt; b and 0 otherwise<br />
below(a,b) - returns 1 if a &lt; b and 0 otherwise<br />
getosc(a,b,c) - returns the oscilloscope data at a band centered at a of width b from channel c - picture a regular oscilloscope going from 0 to 1 taking data from channel c; put a vertical line at x = a, then make it b wide: the average of the points within the band is the data returned<br />
getspec(a,b,c) - returns the spectrum analyzer data in the same way as getosc<br />
<br />
And...none of your other links work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion about the periodic and logarithmic functions, Atero. And thanks for the info about the other functions. Those'll help me out some. A couple quick questions, though:<br />
<br />
What do the notations of &quot;==&quot; and &quot;!=&quot; mean? I am unfamiliar with these symbols.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
And...none of your other links work.<br />
Could you be more specific, please? If links aren't working on my site, it'd help to know which ones are broken. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the link permission, Sandarqii. And yes, feel free to link to my site as well. It would be very cool if we could find some more people with sites similiar to ours and get a community of sites going.:D <br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about that &lt;noembed&gt; idea, though. I'm pretty certain something like that violates the use agreement that most users have to agree with to sign up with most free web space providers (mandatory advertising in exchange for your web space), so that might be risky.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">&quot;==&quot; and &quot;!=&quot; both come from real programming languages. (C, Java, perl, not COBOL (stupid COBOL))<br />
<br />
&quot;a==b&quot; means &quot;is a equal to b&quot;<br />
&quot;a!=b&quot; means &quot;is a not equal to b&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks, Jaheckelsafar. I don't have much programming knowledge...well, make that no programming knowledge;) ...so that was helpful. <br />
<br />
I've done plenty of scripting (HTML, DHTML, and some CSS and JavaScript), but haven't looked much into real programming languages yet...I should probably start learning at least a little of these languages (C, Java, Perl).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Had to use it for 8 months man. Never again.<br />
<br />
Just so you don't get get completely lost, you might want to start with PHP. It goes hand in hand with the web languages. It's not as complex and C and Java where you can quickly become lost, but it does do flow control and arrays and all that good stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">PHP has the string-processing and hash-table power of Perl combined with the clear syntax of C/C++. Very yummy.<br />
<br />
I even use it as a shell scripting language. Using some registry hacks and such you can make it so .php files execute directly from the CMD like an exe or bat.</div></div><hr />

  Your problems with the links on my page is strange. I haven't had any problems with these links on any of the several computers I've accessed the site from. Downloads doesn't work because I haven't made a downloads page yet. Aside from that, all the other links seem to work (I just checked them).<br />

Do it before the light bulb goes out!<br />

<div class="posttext">We were all here once. I remember me experimenting with the SSC and getting nothing but mess.<br />
<br />
To draw a line with the SSC:<br />
  In the Point field of the SSC write: x=i. Isn't that a pretty line? Well, it all starts from here...<br />
<br />
What you need is to:<br />
1) Search the forums. There is plenty of stuff on this topic there.<br />
2) Read the FAQ.<br />
3) Get loaded with tutorials (try searching for &quot;AVS Primer&quot; and other in the forums)<br />
4) Go to sites like mine (AVS Discussion (http://www.geocities.com/avsdiscussion)) or soulcatalyst's (http://soulcatalyst.***********/main.html)<br />
5) Experiment a lot (you'll get the hang of it eventually)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I just realized I need a little more of a transition from Algebra I graphing to get to where this part of my guide starts.  I'll work on getting basic line graphing a little later, but I hope the Microsoft Word document is a help for now.

<div class="posttext">I've finally gone back and started working on SoulCatalyst's Domain again. It's been about a month and a half since the last page update, but i hope to keep future updates closer together. <br />
<br />
The main site is now the Tripod one  (http://soulcatalyst.***********/), and the Xoasis site will be for experimenting with page design, and thus may not be the most up to date. This also makes it so I only have to update one site instead of two to add something new, which should help to make updates faster. <br />
<br />
The links and downloads pages are finally up, and there's now a guestbook for SoulCatalyst's Domain (at the tripod site), and I'll be working on more tutorials for the basics of AVS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">UnConeD</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th August 2002, 11:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">The explanation of d=atan(d) is pretty simple... first of all you need to know how movements work:<br />
<br />
The formulas you enter specify the *source* pixel in function of the *target*. When AVS applies the movement, it looks up the source pixels for every target pixel and copies the colour from source to target.<br />
<br />
So when you specify d=d*2, you're saying that pixels halfway to the edge (d=0.5) should get the colour that is at the edge (d=0.5*2=1). This means that the image will be zoomed *out*: the area (-1...1) gets squised into (-0.5...0.5).<br />
<br />
Now if this makes sense, you'll understand why atan(d) makes a tunnel movement. Open this in a new window:<br />
http://acko.net/dump/datand.png<br />
<br />
The red line is the plot of f(x)=x, a 45° angled line. This is 'no movement', every point gets projected onto itself.<br />
<br />
The blue curve is an approximation of the plot of f(x)=atan(x). I exaggerated the curving to make it easier to illustrate.<br />

We take a point at a certain distance (the leftmost fat ellipse on the bottom axis) and we're going to apply the movement d=atan(d). We trace its location on the graph upwards (gray line). We need to draw a horizontal line and intersect with the blue curve. This is where this point would end up after one step of movement. Again, this is not how AVS works, but this is how it works intuitively.<br />
<br />
We trace down again and find the target distance as the second point from the left on the axis. You can see the point moved ******ds.<br />
<br />
Now we keep applying this: trace up, trace horizontal, intersect with blue, trace down to find out where it will end after several frames (and repeated movement). You can see that because the distance between the red line and the blue line increases, the point will move ******ds faster and faster.<br />
<br />
What we're doing is actually a kind of source map now. AVS looks at the graph 90° rotated. You can understand that, if the blue curve doesn't cover the entire vertical range, that some points on the red line might not have a target horizontally of them. This is why a source-map can leave holes in the image.<br />
<br />
Now what this example doesn't show is that there can be a huge difference is resulting movement from two slightly different curves, because the shape of the movement is the result of repeatedly following the points, rather than just once.</div></div><hr />
