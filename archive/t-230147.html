      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS Crashing/Freezing on fullscreen.</strong><br />
      Hi Guys,<br />
      <br />
      Not really sure what the problem is here, but it lays when I double click on the AVS window to make it fullscreen. Most times it will work fine, however on the rare chance it will actually freeze up. You can still change songs in Winamp, but the AVS has frozen. If you try and 'end task' for avs it will crash Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      When this happens the AVS is its a little black window in the top left corner of the screen. It can't be clicked to make full screen, it doesn't respond.<br />
      <br />
      Winamp options =<br />
      <br />
      Use fullscreen overlay mode<br />
      Videomode = 320x200@32BPP<br />
      Vertical screen height = 100%<br />
      <br />
      These are the only options I have changed, everything else is default.<br />
      <br />
      I have noticed something that might help solve this though. I have only been able to get AVS to freeze up when I have my second monitor (projector) enabled. Whether its duplicating my primary screen or acting as a second desktop. Could this have something to do with it? Doesn't mean that it won't happen when the second monitor is disabled - I just haven't been able to get it to happen.<br />
      <br />
      I am running the latest winamp, but this problem still happened with the last 2 versions of winamp.<br />
      <br />
      WindowsXP<br />
      P4 1.8ghz<br />
      512mb ram.<br />
      radeon 9800pro<br />
      <br />
      I have attached a screenshot to demonstrate what actually happens. Please see - <a href="http://members.optushome.com.au/excruciating/avs" target="_blank">http://members.optushome.com.au/excruciating/avs</a><br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Have you tried a different video mode? Is the <b>320x200</b>@32BPP mode compatible with second monitor (projector)?<br />
      <br />
      Not sure of what else to say. I will move this to AVS Troubleshooting, where you can get better help.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So, did it work fine until... then it just started having this symptom, or did it always? Seems like a vid card driver conflict on the face of it. ATI is infamous for this (Mach64 here). I just paint my desktop rather than run in fullscreen.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi JohnnyMac - All seems to work fine with the 320x200 most of the time. It just seems to mess up in the long run.<br />
      <br />
      Hi Jornet777 - Pretty sure I have always had this problem, I just need to find out what is causing it now. When you say you paint your desktop rather then fullscreen, do you mean just stretch the AVS box out?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think the problem is with using "fullscreen overlay mode", i have the same problem as you. Disabling fullscreen overlay mode seems to work, though for me it will then always "throw" the winamp windows in different positions after exiting fullscreen mode.<br />
      <br />
      I don't think there's a solution to it, until of course a new AVS version comes out (maybe in the year 2007? :hang: )<br />
      So you'll just have to choose between two annoyances, throwing windows or the occasional crash or two.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Settings&gt; Display&gt; tick overlay mode *and* set desktop to color. You can also try disabling Overlay. Just play with the settings until you get some combination that works, or if none do, then its your vid card/drivers combination, not AVS.<br />
      <br />
      To answer your question, no its not stretching the small box out, its as I outlined above. The phrase "painting the desktop" refers to AVS ability to copy in the image its creating in the small box onto the desktop, like wallpaper, cept moving.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks guys for your feedback - really appreciate it! Tuggummi's idea seems to be working very well. I will keep 'stress testing' it and see how it goes.</p>
