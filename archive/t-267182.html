      <p class="post-content"><strong>Preset challenge (please help)</strong><br />
      Alright, I'd like to tap into the wealth of knowledge here cause I've got no idea what I'm doing.<br />
      <br />
      I'd like to make a preset that<br />
      <br />
      -has 21 rectangles, each with a different colour, based on ROYGBIV, from left to right<br />
      <br />
      - the rectangles are triggered with noise<br />
      <br />
      -the rectangles correspond to set sound frequencies, the left most rectangle (red) represents the lowest frequencies and the rightmost rectangle responds to the highest frequencies. And they are graded through the middle.<br />
      <br />
      -the intensity/volume of the frequency affetcs the brightness of the rectangle. So no noise = transparent, loud noise = bright colour<br />
      <br />
      Any help will be most greatly appreciated</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was going to write a howto, but then, you can read tutorials just as good as anyone else.<br />
      <br />
      I made this quick setup because I'm bored, just read through the code to find out how I did it and tweak it yourself to make a good preset out of it.. even though that will be difficult.<br />
      <br />
      I added the variable nn to be able to enter the amount of rectangles you want (nn=21 now).<br />
      I also made the linesize 1 pixel wider to get rid of ugly black lines.<br />
      <br />
      It's probably tidier and better to use a Triangle instead of a SuperScope.<br />
      <br />
      Have fun tinkering with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">better to use triangles and learn how to do something properly than badly...<br />
      <br />
      i would write an example, but i am lazy</p>
