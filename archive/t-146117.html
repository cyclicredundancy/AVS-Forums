<div class="posttext">Not sure what its meant to look like.. looks like some random colored lines and points that are warped to me. Slowing it down is easy.. just make those three on beat variables smaller.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First off, don't write like that - it's a bit irritating.  This isn't AIM.<br />
<br />
I can't really say much about the DM since it's hard to see exactly what the dm does.  The texture(i.e. all the stuff before the DM) isn't that great - it's way too crazy and is a bit too black.  This makes it difficult to see exactly what the dm is doing.<br />
<br />
Alright, I took out your texture and just put in a picture render to see what the DM does.  It's ok, but fairly often it just creates a screen full of stretched lines that doesn't look all that great.  It is nice to see that you can code fairly well, but the preset could use a bit more on the aesthetic side.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work and I hope to see more of you.  Welcome to the AVS forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Anubis means don't talk like you would in a chatroom, this is a forum, and people (usually) have enough time to reply with a properly typed message.  Just don't use 'abbreviations' like that.  AIM is AOL Instant Messenger, I think, I don't have AOL so don't yell at me if I'm wrong ;) <br />
<br />
Your DM is kind of neat, but if you slowed it down it would be easier to see and use in a preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Multiplying a whole component (x, y, d or r) of a texture by zero or values close to zero tends to create a liney effect.</div></div><hr />
