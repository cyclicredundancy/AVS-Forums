      Yup, I said I quit, but of course we all know that doesn't really mean completely :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I'm still not really doing AVS that much but I got bored one time and made a few things. They really aren't much, but I suppose they're a step above n00bish.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yah, they are colourful... Puke is colourful too, but i don't like puke... it's pretty nasty stuff. But that's okay since most of the time you see puke is when you're drunk and at that state you don't really care about it, you just laugh at it like an idiot.<br />
      <br />
      These presets are colourful, but that's not bad. But they seem a bit monotenous though, which is a bit bad. A bit bad ain't good, but a bit bad ain't all that bad.<br />
      <br />
      <i>Neon Blobs From Oblivion</i> is not allt hat bad, it is pretty nice. But it gets boring which is a bit bad and it doesn't react to music that well which is much bad. Otherwise it's pretty nice.<br />
      <br />
      <i>yathoshoish</i> is nice too, although i hate yathosho, which is a bit bad. But that doesn't mean the preset is bit bad, i just don't like the artist. Nice one still :up:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh and PAKKIE, im not going to even bother to answer on that one.</p>
