      <p class="post-content">here's an updated version.<br />
      <br />
      runs on a superscope now, not a texer, so no need for any .bmps, and also gets a higer framerate and i've upped the 'resolution'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ahh clever using the ssc for that, I might go try that with some of mine that render in a similar fashion.<br />
      <br />
      Why did you add the buffer load/save bit? Reverting it to how the original was gains ~9fps for me. (not complaining, just inquiring) Though admittedly it actually seems nicer at a lower frame rate.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the effects list adds a slight fadeout between frames, something the texer did better by itself.<br />
      not a huge difference, but i was trying to get them to look as similar as possible</p>
