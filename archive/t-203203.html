<div class="posttext">wtf do you think you're doing??<br />
<br />
1.) Mr.Nudge was supposed to care about that pack<br />
<br />
2.) You didn't ask if you could use those presets.<br />
<br />
you can be glad that the pack has been removed already so i don't exactly know if my preset was in, but i presume so.<br />
<br />
<br />
by your leave, but you're an 1d10t.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wow.. that was a pretty bad atmosphere in that thread. :eek:  Has it often been so exciting?<br />
<br />
I only met him once when i was new here, and promptly got rebuked. :)<br />
Imagine what would happend if atero came back and gets acquainted with our flamemagnet...</div></div><hr />

if someone else does it, why complain about it!! :igor: :igor: :igor: :igor: :igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Don't get us wrong, it's not about you creating a pack, it's about that we discussed toghether who would compile it all into a pack and that was not you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">PAK-9</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 08:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I'm not upset that it was MaTT specifically that made the pack, just that no-one asked permission. If Mr Nudge makes the same compilation and puts it on devart I'll still be asking why I wasn't consulted. It's the principle not the act.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 11:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">but i'd make sure it was alright with people if i used their presets.<br />
<br />
And i'm not trying to sound offensive here, but it has been said here and i do remember saying that i would put the pack together, although now that i think about it, it is a rather silly idea since the pack is afterall dedicated to you, but then again, this post does enforce the tendancy you have for getting flamed and doing things wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 11:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">nevertheless i think you mr_nudge should make this pack. if only as a matter of principle, but i have a much better feeling about it this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Doggy Dog</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 12:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Yes, well, you make the pack, and I'll let it pass, but if I hear ONE complaint about including other peoples presets without asking permission, it's going down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 12:19</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">by saying &quot;ok. mr_nudge, you can compile the flame-presets&quot; * in that other thread i gave my permission that Mr_Nudge** is allowed to use my preset in that compilation.<br />
<br />
* not literally!<br />
** and no one else!<br />
<br />
so i won't complain then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Warrior of the Light</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 12:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't either. Sure, the flame itself is about 2 years old so it's not that recent and the preset is that not that representative for me anymore but it may be added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">[Ishan]</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th December 2004, 14:14</div></div>
