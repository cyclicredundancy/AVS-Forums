		Subfourm=AVS Presets? Your presets do need some more, pizzaz, (better colors, more reactive, more interesting design), good start anyways.

		It is a custom to <u>credit the author</u> who's stuff like ie. code, bitmaps etc. you use in your own preset. Otherwise you just might get a rip report about your pack as soon as you post it and it will be taken down, and somehow i doubt that's very fun...
