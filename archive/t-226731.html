      What's up with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=145668&amp;show=reviews" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail...8&amp;show=reviews</a> ?<br />
      <br />
      I downloaded it, thinking the image was a low-resolution screen-cap from a 3D catDJ. Ummm, wrong. It's a download for a really fast, really short, .AVI loop. What gives?<br />
      <br />
      Biggest annoyance? It just installs like it's some kind of actual visualization. No warning, no notes that it's just a super-short movie, and a crappy one at that. Installs so you think someone actually took some time and made an effort. Then when it doesn't load you go investigating and find out why it doesn't load(and nope it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out). On top of all that, the staff review doesn't even mention that it's only a .avi file, so a total newbie can't even find it or figure out what went wrong.<br />
      <br />
      I realize I'm still a beginner, but even without frankensteining from other people's presets(with credit of course), and a little effort + 0 coding, a person can make something better than this. Heck, change the angle of the dot-fountain, and slap the psychotic beaming ******d movement on top, and you wind up with a decent copy of the low budget special effects in Michael Jackson's Rock With You video(yeah, that's way back, but you know what I mean).<br />
      <br />
      I just really needed to rant about this thing, and couldn't think of anyone else who might feel my pain. I'm guessing the Pak-9s and Tuggummis of the world might be even more annoyed by this person calling this thing an AVS preset or visualization.<br />
      <br />
      I'm in a very grrr kind of mood now :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">that really does suck, but you have to think about the effort that might have been put into creating that crappy dj cat, it doesn't exploit AVS's full capabilities (at the least), but other people (real people) might find it cute or what ever. just something diffrent is my perspective.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah but other people might not even be able to get it to load<br />
      because of the lack of proper setup. I tried to tell them in the reviews, not sure if it showed up though:(</p>
