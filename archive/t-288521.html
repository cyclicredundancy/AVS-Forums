		A while ago, Yathosho suggested that I use a more colorful background, so here are 2 presets: Radioactive plant plasma and itâ€™s remix. The remix doesnâ€™t look a lot like the original because I changed the color scheme, deleted the unnecessary effects and added a few new effects. It looks kind of what some of the VisBot preset look like, and I havenâ€™t decided which I prefer. <br />
<br />
Here it is...

		the remix has a very vis-bot colour map to it and i like the effects.<br />
<br />
some thing's i'd change though, having 4 sscs all with 800 points to produce something as simple as a cylinder is kinda pointless with all those effect after it. try to cull as many points as you can without changing the presets over all appearance.<br />
<br />
also, simple convo filters are often much faster and fine-tunable sources of blurring/fading than trans&gt;blur.

		Thanks <br />
<br />
I changed the number of points from 800 to a simple line with 2 points. The line size is then changed depending on the speed of the particle. I tried to make a blur effect with the convolution filter, but the only thing I could make was:<br />
___1___<br />
1_-3_ 1<br />
___1___<br />
which gives a kind of noisy effect.<br />
<br />
Besides using an effect list, it there any way to make a blur similar to the trans&gt;blur with the convolution fitler?<br />
<br />
Here is the preset with the above changes
