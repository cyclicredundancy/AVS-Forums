I'm going to go trip out on it on fullscreen now.  Hopefully I'll remember to eat sometime...<br />

PS: I've attatched it for those who haven't seen it yet.  It's part of Whacko AVS VI.</div></div><hr />

You're kinda late...<br />
<br />
Still, it's nice to see that someone praises an AVSer :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have that one, I have all of UnConed's AVS packs :) <br />
<br />
I edited the DM to make possible to go in any of the 6 directions, even if it is in a 90 degree turn and there is no tunnel there, it can go through it. I kept the origional too. If anybody wants it let me know.<br />
<br />
Good job Mr. Wittens!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The point of the DM is to use the available directions - a much better stuff on the coding side than going noclip.<br />
<br />
I think I *might* be able to do with a little code-digging, but the chance of that is pretty damn unlikely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Eh? No attatchment...<br />
NM.<br />
<br />
I know I'm a bit late.  Hence 'discovered'.  It still r0xx0rz. :D I'm just amazed that anyone could do anything like that with AVS.  I don't think I could no anything like it anywhere near as well in a full-blown compiled programming language, let alone scripting.<br />
<br />
It looks even better if you up the number of divisions in the DM.  I still get good FPS on 32x32.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have version I or II?<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Gaekwad: You use Mozilla, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Download his earlier packs to get I and II(I believe I was in II, and II was in V).<br />
<br />
Also download Jheriko's last pack(Jheriko - Pack 9) - it has some amazing stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No, the first version was in Whacko II and the second version was in V.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's what I said :p .  Yay for edit button :p .<br />
<br />
I love UnConeD's remix of Jheriko's Chmutov(sp) in pack 9.  It's awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That's one of my personal favorites. Though the list of really great presets is enormous. (Too bad the list of shitty presets is even bigger...) :p.</div></div><hr />
