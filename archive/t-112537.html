      <p class="post-content"><strong>Random crashes?</strong><br />
      I'm running Winamp3 on my computer with the Alarm and Goodnight scripts going so my computer acts as an alarm clock for me. The problem is, I like to leave AVS going fullscreen on my pc; and it randomly finds places to crash at. I think it is only certain presets that do make it crash, because if I restrict the random to only be certain presets it works fine. All of my AVS presets are reputable and stuff, el-vis, UndefineD, AVSociety, and UnConeD...so I find it strange that they would be causing these crashes....any help??<br />
      <br />
      BTW I'm running Win2k on an Athlon XP 2000+ with 512mb DDR Ram</p>

      Anyway, if it helps, I'm running W98 with Winamp3 on a P3 500mHz with 64MB SDRAM. The thing crashes every now and then, sometimes it looks like a certain preset. One preset from Nic01's fourth pack looks like a culprit, sometimes a Whacko II (can't remember which) does it. Maybe it's got something to do with AVS not handling the complexity of presets?<br />
      <br />
      Or then again, it's probably just a Winamp3 bug. Avoid using fullscreen for long periods, that can be a trigger.

      <p class="post-content">Neither of you are any help!! pfft! :p<br />
      <br />
      WA2 doesn't have MMD3 and it doesn't have the Alarm or Goodnight scripts.<br />
      <br />
      And I like having the vis on fullscreen as I go to sleep....I can stare at it and trip out as I slowly drift out of consciousness....<br />
      <br />
      I'll just stick to keeping the random to a select few presets that I know won't crash it</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, sometimes on complex presets AVS craps out. UnConeD mentions it in his readme files. All you can do is create a crash free folder, put in the presets you know don't crash it, and put that dir as the random select one.</p>

      <p class="post-content">As far as I know, the problem happens only with blended dynamic movements. It can crash when switching from a preset like this (the preset you're switching *to* doesn't matter). You can tell the difference with other code-related crashes, because they happen while the preset is running, not at the end.<br />
      <br />
      Your only option is to leave out those presets, though that's probably a lot of them. Not much to do about it. Switching Winamp won't help much, because AVS hasn't changed on the inside between WA2 and WA3. Though there seem to be a lot of things that can affect the frequency of crashes. Try doing a fresh reboot before beginning your nightly 'session'.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I heard from somewhere that if you check the 'pre-init on load preset' from 'transitions' the crashing stops. I dunno if it's true because haven't tested it since it makes preset loading so slow... Also I don't know does WA3 have this feature, or does it affect to Fullscreen AVS anyway..</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, there's a change to AVS from W2 to W3, but is easily unnoticed and perhaps for the worse : No more Matrix-style input-stopping...<br />
      <br />
      Pre-init starts the preset early, and is supposed to prevent you to see the common beginning emptiness... since the pre-init time can't be defined, and it usually doesn't help, it's best to leave this off.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well I turned pre-init off cuz it made loading go slower, but it really does make a big diff for me</p>
