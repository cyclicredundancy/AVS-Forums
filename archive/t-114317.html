      Is there a way to keep the visualizations from automatically changing? Under transition, I turned everthing off. Thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Transitions only change the things that is going on in preset changing, such as pre-init (Don't use) and transition effects (Unless you're using AVS for a huge party, don't use it).<br />
      <br />
      Look under Presets/Hotkeys. Look a little down. There!<br />
