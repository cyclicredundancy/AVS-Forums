Nice pics, someone should make 3D SSC's out of those wireframe objects hanging there... any on-party reactions to AVS?<br />

Oh and judging by the amount of people rolling and smoking, I think the air in there must've smelled pretty spicey :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">No, i havn't puplished any packs.<br />
<br />
The thing is, as i do VJing with a Freeware Programm, i kept most of my works to myself to prevent someone copying my set, which could easily be done if i published My Presets and my selfmade VJ-program.<br />
<br />
I dont know, maybe it's a Childish way to think about it, but i've seen many guys playing randomly downloaded stuff from UnConeD and others and they keep calling themselves VJ's. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I would never dare to use someone elses Presets anyway. :o <br />
<br />
Let's see, i'm gonna check my Stuff and make a Pack, lets say about 20 Presets for the Community in the Forums, i dont think any of you is gonna abuse it. :D <br />

<div class="posttext">Most of us here would like for you to use our presets at parties.  As long as we get some recognition and it isn't passed off as your own, we would love to have you show our stuff.  And if you posts pictures of our presets and the reactions people have, nearly everyone will be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's not the point. Of course everyone should use published presets. But as i see it, this should be not the case when you want to do VJing with them (unless you give credits to the author which nearly no VJ does :mad: ).<br />
<br />
Example: Legohead (sorry i had to use someone) downloads a load of presets, takes is PC to a Party turns it on, leans back and gets paid afterwards.<br />
<br />
I just think thats not fair because he has'nt even done a real VJing - and unfortunately most of the so called VJ's that i know work exactly this way.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the set of Presets and the way you arrange them according to music has to be an unit.<br />
<br />
So you gotta know:<br />
- Your set in detail (how the presets look like and behave)<br />
- Your DJ's set and the music he plays to react properly<br />
- Your tools (in my case AVS and Hotlist for VJing)<br />
<br />
So far for my Point of View. The Pack is still to come...<br />
<br />
<br />
@Anubis i alraedy knew that but the other case is that i try to differ from the other &quot;VJ's&quot; by using only my presets. But if the Day comes when i run out of ideas, i'll think back what you said... ;) <br />
<br />

Polymorph is a Forum from many Underground Websites in Leipzig (the city where i live). Most Members are crazy guys just like me. Btw, thats where i took the extraordinary smilies from that i use.</div></div><hr />

So and now, as promised, my (very first!) AVS-Pack release<br />
<br />
After all 40 Presets of my best Stuff.<br />
Unfortunately i couldnt add my latest ones (forgot them at home) and i also had to leave out some very cool ones because they use very large avi's and bmp's. Nevertheless it' pretty good for a first Pack :D<br />
<br />
And here are the APE's you'll need:<br />
<br />
channelshift<br />
amoeba<br />
amoeba3d<br />
flame<br />
flock<br />
fyrewurx<br />
metaballs3d<br />

<div class="posttext">We've had a few discussions about it, and almost everyone agreed that if you show their presets at a party, they'd love you for it.<br />
<br />
Most preset authors aren't VJ's and don't have powerful beamers, so more exposure is better :).<br />
<br />
Last big party I was at used some sort of Geiss/Milkdrop clone (I don't think it was Milkdrop itself, I didn't recognize any presets), Wildtangent dancing babes, video-loop and a live feed of the audience.<br />
<br />
I've also observed people's reactions to visuals at parties. While Wildtangent visualisers usually capture people's attention at first, they get boring quickly. After all, at a rave, there are dancing people everywhere, and usually wildtangent dancers are not in perfect sync anyway.</div></div><hr />

I even think we had a talk about that hlf a year ago, but i'm too lazy to search it.<br />
<br />
Have you already had a look at my Pack? Maybe you could propose some presets that would fit my Style... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Rationalise it this way - how many DJ's have told you who's song they are playing???????<br />
A VJ is the same - only visual. However if its one thing I've learn't - theres alot more to VJing than chucking on a few presets (like magic says).<br />
<br />
At the end of the day it has to have meaning, has to flow, has to take the viewer somewhere. A VJ has a hard job because he has to match the musics mood (which can be quite hard).<br />
<br />
This weekend Im starting out with some OPENGL picture candy, then Im doing a kaleidascope set (using picture loader for more interesting textures) because its MUSHROOM season - and the crowds gonna go fkn sick at seeing morphing crazy shit. <br />
Then I might do a completely different set when the morning DJ's come on and get into some psycadellic/dimensional stuff. <br />
Making presets is one thing - making it work is an entirely different ball game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several DJ's have, as a matter of fact.  Many will announce what song they are playing(at least sometimes).  VJ'ing is a lot different, though, because a large population of people seeing them would assume that the VJ made them.  Very, very few people would recognize AVS presets, and most don't know what AVS is.  just a title AVS that you play at the beginning and end of the party that mentions those whose presets you are using.  I have heard about instances of VJ's taking credit for presets that aren't theirs.  As long as you don't do this I don't mind that much, but I would like to have recognition(not that you'd use any of mine).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thats fair. I wouldn't think much of a vj who 'assorts' other peoples work. Although I do use remixes which is ok (as defined by copyright I can modify content by 25% and it becomes my intellectual property - how do you quantify 25%..hmmmmm...).<br />
<br />
But then again, at the end of the day no-one really cares. VJ's are usually the unsung heros.</div></div><hr />

Well, you can do well with a middle class PC!<br />
I'm using a 1 Ghz Athlon @ 400*300 res and it's fine because the Beamer does a lot of smoothing for you. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You only need to output @ 800X600 - even on xga projectors it doesn't make too much difference (whos gonna notice). Upgrade your ram (higher fsb=more juice), close background apps, set thread priority to high, shrink screen hight to 80% (if all else fails), use pixel doubling and 32 bit colour modes. If you want that extra bit of speed reinstall windows and then install winamp first. 2ghz is plenty. <br />
Most of my preset peak out at about 30fps now (anything above 24fps is pretty much seamless).</div></div><hr />
