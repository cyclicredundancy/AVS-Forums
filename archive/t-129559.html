      <p class="post-content">Quite hard to tell without seeing the pack, the name can and usually is about the theme of the pack like "Highres" , "Another Version" , "I wanna be Frank Nagel" , "Bitmapped" etc.<br />
      <br />
      But i vote for "The Search" anyway :igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with the "make a series" idea. Or at least theme the name around the pack. The name means nothing if it has nothing to do with anything in the pack. Are Cradle Of Filth album titles really necessary? I voted for the search but completely at random (aside from cruelty and the beast) because it seems like you could theme a good intro around it maybe.</p>
