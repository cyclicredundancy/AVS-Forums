      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D Caviar</strong><br />
      3D Fish that lay eggs and a cool Dynamic Movement in the background<br />
      <br />
      If you like this, then you may like the very last version of my 3D XWing that has a similar Dynamic Movement<br />
      <br />
      The Dynamic Movement has a bit of feed back that adds little effects in the background (so much time adjusting brightness to get this perfect)<br />
      <br />
      The colours of the background are determined by the values in the Super Scope, and frozen between sets of beats (because it looks good when static as well as dynamic)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thats pretty cool... a bit ugly though.. maybe you could stop the texture from filling up so heavily from time to time.</p>

      Well, feedback was what I wanted<br />
      But I can see what you mean about too much<br />
      <br />
      Here is a darker version, with less feedback<br />
      <br />
      I view this at about 15FPS<br />
      I Imagine that any faster and its behaviour may change</p>

      <p class="post-content">looks little ugly but its nice, but the 3d work is really good ;) keep it up<br />
      <br />
      btw, you should optimize your code to gain more speed...</p>

      <p class="post-content">You are really good at 3D scoping, now once you need to work on asthetics a little bit though, the fish look superb, but the background is completly horendous. I don't like the colors it has, it isn't very dynamic (constantly goes through the same routine), and I also don't like the shape it has. But let me congragulate you again on some more great scoping.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for all of the feedback!<br />
      <br />
      I really wanted to create small eddie like feedback loops and still look slick<br />
      <br />
      I think I'll progress the idea<br />
      <br />
      BTW in another post, X-Wing and Tie Fighters, I posted a DM that nobody looked at :(<br />
      <br />
      It defintately had cool eddies - although not optimised at all<br />
      <br />
      I shall conquer the eddie!</p>

      <p class="post-content">I agree with all comments :p The scoping is great, keep it up!. But I don't really like the background, you should work on that stuff.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah, i agree with everybody here, the background <b>does</b> kinda look ugly.:rolleyes:<br />
      try focusing on aesthetics 3d scoping is'nt everything:p:)</p>
