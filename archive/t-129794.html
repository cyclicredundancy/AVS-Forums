      Yeah, if this were possible, AVS would become 10 times faster :D<br />
      What I want is: There should be a sort of a module ( like in visual basic ) where you can declare and set values to variables per frame and beat.<br />
      these variables can be accesed from all the ssc's movement, dm's, ddm's, ds's, bumps, and all others using custom variables</p>

      <br />
      oh and there should special, accessable, global control vars as well.<br />
      <br />
      Reason: you can place those vars on important places in your code and control them from maybe a vj-tool like hotlist if you're using one.</p>

      </blockquote>I think that speaks for itself.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I talked about UnConeD's APE just to give some additional information. Yes, that won't be of any use to us right now. That is why I said that we are going to have to wait. Be patient, Nullsoft has a lot to do with WA2.9 and WA3. We've already tried to get them to work on AVS, but, unfortunately, it is on the back burner right now.

      <p class="post-content">My global-var getosc hack is not what you imagine it to be. It allows you to export values from one superscope into other components, but only through a painful process and with very limited precision. The superscope in question can NOT draw anything and has to have all its code in its perframe section.<br />
      <br />
      It's only useful for extreme presets (and I mean really extreme, not just a 3D DM) where global vars are simply necessary and synching is not an option.<br />
      <br />
      Real global vars will require an AVS code update, no APE can fix that.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah. Sorry if I make it out to be more than it is. I think it's sweet and since I haven't actually seen it I don't have a perfect idea of what it is. Even if it isn't the greatest, it still sounds useful.</p>

      <br />
      All i can do is collect all new whishes make one treat out of em and hope Rova updates it.<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, guess i should do that.
