<div class="posttext">Yeah, if this were possible, AVS would become 10 times faster :D<br />
What I want is: There should be a sort of a module ( like in visual basic ) where you can declare and set values to variables per frame and beat.<br />
these variables can be accesed from all the ssc's movement, dm's, ddm's, ds's, bumps, and all others using custom variables</div></div><hr />

Misc / GlobalVar :D<br />
<br />
oh and there should special, accessable, global control vars as well.<br />
<br />
Reason: you can place those vars on important places in your code and control them from maybe a vj-tool like hotlist if you're using one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Please search the forums before you post.  This has been brought up many times.  UnConeD has his own ape that has global variables, but he won't release it because it's a hack.  We are going to have to wait until they update avs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ever heard of the phrase, &quot;quit your bitching&quot;?  If you want the wishlist updated so badly, update it yourself.</div></div><hr />

Usage and definition of global variables that can be accessed by all components of a preset. <br />
<br />
I think that speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
Also, I talked about UnConeD's APE just to give some additional information.  Yes, that won't be of any use to us right now.  That is why I said that we are going to have to wait.  Be patient, Nullsoft has a lot to do with WA2.9 and WA3.  We've already tried to get them to work on AVS, but, unfortunately, it is on the back burner right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">My global-var getosc hack is not what you imagine it to be. It allows you to export values from one superscope into other components, but only through a painful process and with very limited precision. The superscope in question can NOT draw anything and has to have all its code in its perframe section.<br />
<br />
It's only useful for extreme presets (and I mean really extreme, not just a 3D DM) where global vars are simply necessary and synching is not an option.<br />
<br />
Real global vars will require an AVS code update, no APE can fix that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yeah.  Sorry if I make it out to be more than it is.  I think it's sweet and since I haven't actually seen it I don't have a perfect idea of what it is.  Even if it isn't the greatest, it still sounds useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, i would, if you'd tell me how. The thread is locked and i'm not a mod as you know. (BTW if you'll relly become mod it would be your task to do this ;))<br />
<br />
All i can do is collect all new whishes make one treat out of em and hope Rova updates it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, guess i should do that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can write up what you want changed and submit it to Rovastar.  But don't tell him to put global variables in the wishlist since they already are in there.</div></div><hr />
