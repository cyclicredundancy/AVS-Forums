<div class="posttext">:mad: Just about now i had made an Beautifull preset and then what happens?I accidently click &quot;new&quot; instead of &quot;save&quot; and all was gone :cry: :( I had'ent saved.<br />
:hang: <br />
there should some prompt before making a new preset like&quot;Do you wish to save the changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now i have to make that all over again:hang:<br />

<div class="posttext">That happened to me a couple of times.  The closest solution I found is to use a resource hacker to move the remove button all the way to the right.  I then made a new menu &quot;New Preset&quot; and put &quot;New&quot; under it.  This way, it is very hard to slip.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I agree with Ishan 100%.  I had an awesome preset once, I believe it was called &quot;Incantations in Red&quot; or something.  Then that happened and I was so mad at myself.... it would really nice to have that save prompt.</div></div><hr />

Whenever you select main and then accidently click the '-' button, eveything just vanishes. Very annoying, so I have moved my - button away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Or if avs suddenly crashes everything is lost. Best thing would be a periodic saving to a temporary file.<br />

Btw, i experienced that if winamp is running, my debuggers crash on errors. Now THIS is weird!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">a horrible thing happened to me recently. working on my debut pack, i went into a avs-ing spree churning out a preset every ten minutes. then suddenly...<br />
<br />
a probelem in the program, winamp, has occured. please tell microsoft about this problem.<br />
<br />
... and KA-POW!!! seventeen presets were instantly lost!<br />
<br />
and your reading this saying to yourself &quot;well, if he saved them surely...&quot; <br />
<br />
this experiance almost put me off doing avs anymore. (until i downloaded UnConeD's whacko V, which forced me to get back to work. thanks mate!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">okay, harsh, i have come to the conclusion that you are under the influence of a copious amout of recreational chemicals.<br />
<br />
there is NO WAY that avs can lose 17 presets by crashing.  if you saved one and moved on then it's on the hard disk and it's staying there until you fuck with it.  if you did lose all of those presets then you should plan on getting a new hdd cos it's deteriorating, and badly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only way you could lose 17 presets(and have it be AVS's fault) would be if you were talking about losing 1 preset at a time, seventeen different times.</div></div><hr />

LUCKY[/U] I had just copied my whole avs folder to cd 3 hours earlier :p  <br />
<br />
Hotlist does nothing to bitmaps except to those within the Hotlist/Pictures Folder. And those may be uninstalled too.<br />
But the uninstaller wont take any of your avs pictures.<br />
<br />
I scripted it with NSIS, so maybe this is a NSIS bug, but not my fault then.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i'd like you to test this once again. Any Bug report may help in further developement. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance and sorry for your trouble.<br />

3. STOP BEING STUPID <br />
4. Don't revive dead threads.<br />
It is not a crime to be stupid once, it is a crime to be stupid twice. One last thing, your stupid post makes no sense what-so-ever and my cat can write a more co-herent sentence.</div></div><hr />

A little reading would help. This aint any visual prog or preset. It is a VJ'ing Overhead Application to control AVS.<br />
