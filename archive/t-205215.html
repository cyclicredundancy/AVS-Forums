      ok i guess, I finally went over the top ;; here's my submission for today -- 1 - 5 posts per day in the AVS Forum, otherwise the 'presets' you wanted i've been working hard on ... helped by others for others.... [[ file attatched ]] thanks to UnConeD (woke me up), Jaak (cold hearted bitch damn straight ;) ), pak-9 (the tutorials and help with one or two of the presets ), and tuggummi (major bitch :p )<br />
      here it is i guess, MaTTFuRY v1 (5 presets , all crap - noob )<br />
      well at least i thought so, <b>constructive</b> <i>critisism</i> please?</p>

      constructive review:<br />
      <br />
      <b>Intro</b> - the second part is too dark and too random IMO (***)<br />
      <b>TexerAbleScope</b> - linewidth=10 is always ugly, try avoiding everything above two or three (**)<br />
      <b>Landscapable</b> - ? what is this supposed to do? looks like a random test to me.. (')<br />
      <b>the bright light</b> t3h n00b (*)<br />
      <b>retronic</b> some movement would be good here; the 4 scopes could easily be reduced to 2 (**)</p>

      <p class="post-content">but only because the ugly "random-builtin-crap-on-black-background" which we have seen innumerable times (+5 now) disappears by itself cause of the timecode.<br />
      <br />
      ok but to say something constructive about your presets:<br />
      1. best thing is the timecode (wondering if that's something special), everything else looks... err, like the rest?<br />
      2. standard beginners rotoblitter-makes-ssc-tile-structure preset<br />
      3. what's this??? screen is much too empty!<br />
      4. standard beginners rotoblitter-MovingParticle preset<br />
      5. could be nice, but... hmm looks too grey somehow<br />
      <br />
      Please put your comment right at the beginning of the preset if you want somebody to read it. Most people won't recognize it at the end of the list, cause normally.. no.. <i>always</i> the comment is on top.<br />
      <br />
      and one last thing:<br /></p>
