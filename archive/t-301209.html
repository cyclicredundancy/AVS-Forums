      <p class="post-content"><strong>How long should it take to get published?</strong><br />
      I posted a new pack of avs presets (my first pack),<br />
      and got denied because it included APEs that weren't mine.<br />
      This happened about 2 days after submission.<br />
      <br />
      OK no problem I understand that,<br />
      I removed all stuff that wasn't mine,<br />
      and resubmitted,<br />
      this was over a week ago.<br />
      <br />
      It still sitting in the review queue.<br />
      <br />
      So<br />
      <br />
      How long should it take to get published?<br />
      <br />
      Is there a glitch in the submission procedure because I submitted the new one under the same name?<br />
      <br />
      Do I need to re submit?</p>

      <p class="post-content">it sometimes takes several weeks. it's weird it was rejected in the first place, using third party apes is very common.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it was denied because I actually included the apes in the install file (not just the presets),<br />
      I didn't want to make it too hard on people to get the full pack up and running.<br />
      <br />
      Some of the presets generate fire using a webcam source.<br />
      Here is a sample of that<br />

      <br />
      The pack I submitted is almost entirely fire type presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Oh god that'll kill me.<br />
      <br />
      I haven't posted any new stuff because I got scolded for releasing individual presets,<br />
      and I was thinking<br />
      "I'm making stuff for your product for free and you are complaining?"<br />
      <br />
      But I really did understand how that was annoying,<br />
      and I have made some really fun stuff,<br />
      so all at once I made a pack on impulse<br />
      <br />
      So waiting a month or more to get published will suck.</p>
