<div class="posttext">I posted a new pack of avs presets (my first pack),<br />
and got denied because it included APEs that weren't mine.<br />
This happened about 2 days after submission.<br />
<br />
OK no problem I understand that,<br />
I removed all stuff that wasn't mine,<br />
and resubmitted,<br />
this was over a week ago.<br />
<br />
It still sitting in the review queue.<br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
How long should it take to get published?<br />
<br />
Is there a glitch in the submission procedure because I submitted the new one under the same name?<br />
<br />
Do I need to re submit?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it sometimes takes several weeks. it's weird it was rejected in the first place, using third party apes is very common.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I think it was denied because I actually included the apes in the install file (not just the presets),<br />
I didn't want to make it too hard on people to get the full pack up and running.<br />
<br />
Some of the presets generate fire using a webcam source.<br />
Here is a sample of that<br />

<br />
The pack I submitted is almost entirely fire type presets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i recall a submission around christmas time a couple of years ago. it showed up later in march :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Oh god that'll kill me.<br />
<br />
I haven't posted any new stuff because I got scolded for releasing individual presets,<br />
and I was thinking<br />
&quot;I'm making stuff for your product for free and you are complaining?&quot;<br />
<br />
But I really did understand how that was annoying,<br />
and I have made some really fun stuff,<br />
so all at once I made a pack on impulse<br />
<br />
So waiting a month or more to get published will suck.</div></div><hr />
