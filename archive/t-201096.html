      Hi, there's no general AVS section, so I wasn't really sure of where to stick this.<br />
      <br />
      Basically I was watching television and saw the Lenny Kravitz video for his latest single. I think it's called "Lady". Anyway in it he's surrounded by these tastefully, yet scantilly clad dancers(good choreography by the way), and several monitors which appear to be very large flat panels placed vertically as opposed to horizontally and on all the monitors it appears as if AVS presets are playing.<br />
      <br />
      Then an Eminem video came on and he was standing in front of what looked like a blue screen with what looks like an AVS preset projected.<br />
      <br />
      I normally listen to music as opposed to watching videos, so though I'm sure the videos aren't all that new, they're new to me.<br />
      <br />
      I was just wonderring if anyone else has noticed this stuff. Am I seeing things or are visualizations(AVS and otherwise) taking over the world of music videos?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I haven't seen the videos jet, but it's more than possible that vis-presets have been used. They also let music become apparent, they look cool and in case of avs they would be for free (as long as selfmade presets are used, of course).<br />
      So why shouldn't visualisations be <font size="1">(ab)</font>used by the <font size="1">(greedy)</font> music buisiness?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i've noticed this anomality too, but i doubt they are using AVS. Why? Simply because AVS is just too <b>slow</b> for high-res stuff music-videos &amp; advertisement pictures require. But visualizations in general are becoming to invade the thoughts of general public, so i wouldn't be surprised if there was a sudden increase in the number of AVSters ^^<br />
      <br />
      Still, if you see someone using anything that looks like my stuff, tell me about it so i can flame those greedy bastards to hell :mad:<br />

      <p class="post-content">*Smacks forehead*, oh man, super-duh, on my part. I just don't know how I failed to realize that's the general section. Would you believe there was a short circuit in my brain, thanks to trying to figure out how to do point to point shapes and animations? No? Oh well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it;).</p>
