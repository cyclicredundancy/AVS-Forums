<div class="posttext">This question has been asked before; I did a forum search. But the links posted previously from www.blorp.com are too old and no longer work. Where can I download an old version of AVS that does not require MMX now? Thanks.<br />
<br />
I know where to go to get older versions of winamp, but I have no idea which one has the correct/latest version of non-MMX AVS I should be using inside.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Didn't search too well or you would have found several threads.  One in one of the winamp tech support forums(which I found earlier today to help someone with the same problem).  It took 5 seconds for me to find it:http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=145902</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ah, thanks very much. I had only searched within the AVS Troubleshooting forum; that is why I had not found that other thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">But will the APE requiring MMX support work?<br />
eg. Texer, Color Map, Multiplier, Channel Shift, Convolution, Dynamic Clear Screen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not a clue, never really though about it. Always did AVS on a computer which has MMX support. You're really planning to do AVS on a non-MMX computer? damn, the FPS are you looking at... :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I can say for sure that most of UnConeD's Ape's are MMX optimised. Some of the others may be as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I know that UnConeD and cfp didn't bother including support for no mmx processors... after all only a very small percentage of computers currently in home use have such old processors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Geez I didn't think any would be without the an MMX now-a-days.<br />
<br />
If you are running that spec machine I would run Geiss (www.geisswerks.com) or maybe Acidspunk as it will be the only way of getting decent fps / quailty.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't do AVS justice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yup you guys are right, my AVS really does suck with piss poor framerate. I didn't really know what AVS was since the last visualizations I used were with my Winamp 2.04 which I just replaced with Winamp 2.91 a few days ago. I deleted AVS it's too slow. :)<br />
<br />
I actually didn't want all that fancy 3D graphics stuff. I just want my basic big and nice looking spectrum analyzer with nice colors and high FPS, like the one I had long ago. :) The new Nullsoft Tiny Fullscreen is fast but I don't like how the spectrum analyzer is so small, and I don't want to see the voiceprint. And I'd like to be able to see both channels separately. Time to search winamp.com for the old visualizations I guess, but maybe they are long gone.</div></div><hr />
