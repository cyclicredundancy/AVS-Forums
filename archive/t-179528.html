		I've made a preset that it think would look great with a dynamove so if anyone wants to show off their skill and get their name in my next pack, download this and have go at it then post it back up.

		In reply to Raz and Vanish the dude:  OK I know about those kinds of things, but a majority of AVSers make there own presets and if somebody wants to add to them, they can.  I was mostly trying to point out that he should learn to do DM's because there might not always be someone to do them for him.

		I sped it a bit up (and made it look better i think :)) by using a static convolution filter bump instead of the dynamic ones.<br />
<br />
if you dont to understand it, here's an explanation:<br />
if you look at the convolution filter kernel (that's the 7*7 table with the numbers in it), you'll see this in center:<br />
-1 -2 0<br />
-2 4 2<br />
0 2 1<br />
<br />
this means that if we are for example at pixel(10, 10), the new value for that pixel is the sum of the following lines:<br />
-1 *pixel(9,9)<br />
-2 *pixel(10,9)<br />
0 *pixel(11,9)   &lt;--- this line is left out by the convo filter because its factor is zero<br />
<br />
-2 *pixel(9,10)<br />
4 *pixel(10,10)<br />
2 *pixel(11,10)<br />
<br />
0 *pixel(9,11)     &lt;-- this line, too<br />
2 *pixel(10,11)<br />
1 *pixel(11,11)<br />
<br />
that new value is then divided by the value you enter for &quot;Scaling&quot;.<br />
I hope that was a good explanation :)<br />
<br />
now to the effect of that calculation:<br />
if there is a bright bar, it looks casts a shadow to the lower right and has a highlight on the upper left.

		you champion. A convo filter was good for speeding it up, but it would still be good to have some more 3d-ness to it. Not to worry, this is great. Thanks

		Yeah it does look a little bit the same but thats because it's blue. The other one was just something that came out of nowhere and probably wont be in my next pack.<br />

If someone thinks they can make any of my presets better of different, have a go and get your name in my 2nd pack.
