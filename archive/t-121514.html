<div class="posttext">The link to the FAQ talks about needing a plugin called Jaspers, the writer of this plugin is now saying you no longer need his plugin. And to use something called ASIO (unfortunatly the website for this is in Japanesse). Also the FAQ regarding the Line in seems to be for Winamp 2.8. Am I best using a plugin to get AVS to respond well to the line input or am I okay using linein:// ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any advice would be most welcome<br />

The link to the FAQ talks about needing a plugin called Jaspers,no, you don't need itthe writer of this plugin is now saying you no longer need his plugin. And to use something called ASIO (unfortunatly the website for this is in Japanesse).both plugins reduce the playback latency, you need them if you want avs to respond directly to music, waveout/directsound's playback buffer creates a slight delay between the music that you hear and it's visualizationAlso the FAQ regarding the Line in seems to be for Winamp 2.8.avs, asio and linein:// are available for/in winamp3Am I best using a plugin to get AVS to respond well to the line input or am I okay using linein://?depends on your definition of 'well'</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS depends on the actual waveIn signal when winamp isn't decoding an mp3, and this is selected via the Recording Mixer which is available from the sound mixer (double click the little speaker in the tray).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have downloaded ASIO and put it in the wacs folder, I couldn't find any instructions on how to use it, in Preferences ASIO is now under the Audio submenu, when I click it there are no options. Does this mean it is in and working?. On the website it said ASIO is an audio output plugin not an audio input one.<br />
<br />
I have thew linein:// working as far as I understand that is just native to winamp.<br />
<br />
Cannot find anything in English about ASIO.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

<br />
<div class="posttext">be sure to use the correct version for your version of winamp3, winamp 3.0 final = build 488<br />
<br />
if your soundcard/drivers don't support asio it may not show up in the preferences<br />
<br />
you don't necessarily need the asio plugin as expained in my previous post</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Cool, I think I will just stick with linein://. I am using build 488. I was just hoping to get better beat response.<br />
