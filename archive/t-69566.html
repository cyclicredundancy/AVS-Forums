			<strong>The Winamp.com Site (and winamp.com people)</strong><br />
		
		

		An AVS pack of mine, <a href="http://www.winamp.com/skins/reviews.jhtml?rOT=C&amp;rOI=87723" target="_blank">Whacko AVS III</a> has recently had the 'honour' of hosting a huge discussion in the ratings. All of this has had tons of weird side-effects for the people involved:<br />
<br />
 - They have to vent their opinion in the comments, because there is no way to contact a reviewer.<br />
 - They are forced to re-rate, because it's not allowed to comment without a rating.<br />
<br />
I've tried to contact the WinAMP.com people, but obviously it's impossible to reach them in their 'Ivory Tower' (do feedback-forms get redirected into /dev/null ?). I can imagine they get tons of crap (if you look at all the redundant 'feature-requests' in the wishlist which are already implemented for example), but that's really no excuse.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone here (the mods?) who <i>can</i> get up there and ring the bell?<br />
<br />
I had a huge AVS wishlist a while ago as well, but seeing no way to get it to them, I just tossed it in the bin.

		We can't really go around deleting user accounts just because they're talking in your reviews section.  The star ratings are good, so what's really wrong?

		I am the one who had reviewed (put a comment) you Whacko III pack. I know it would be a good thing if there was an e-mail address in the comment! I mean this: You could send e-mail to the one who has wroted the comment!

			<strong>Deleting???</strong><br />
		
		

		Obviously you misunderstood... I don't mind the comments, I just think it sucks that they have to be there where obviously almost no-one will read them. It's not about the ratings.<br />
<br />
Maybe a direct email link wouldn't be a good idea (can you say &quot;Automated Email Grabbing&quot;), but how about an inbetween &quot;profile&quot; page where you can view a user's submissions and find a link to his email address. That would discourage automated email grabbing, but still allow a person to reach him.

		The main problem I can see with that is thousands of e-mails reading:<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean my presets are only worth 4 stars?  You bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then again, it would very much discourage downrating.  Liek Jones's article ( <a href="http://www.winamp.com/news.jhtml;" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/news.jhtml;</a>$sessionid$C0NEU1AAAVPGNTN24GBBC0A?articleid=9163 )
