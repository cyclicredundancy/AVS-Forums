<div class="posttext">An AVS pack of mine, Whacko AVS III (http://www.winamp.com/skins/reviews.jhtml?rOT=C&amp;rOI=87723) has recently had the 'honour' of hosting a huge discussion in the ratings. All of this has had tons of weird side-effects for the people involved:<br />
<br />
 - They have to vent their opinion in the comments, because there is no way to contact a reviewer.<br />
 - They are forced to re-rate, because it's not allowed to comment without a rating.<br />
<br />
I've tried to contact the WinAMP.com people, but obviously it's impossible to reach them in their 'Ivory Tower' (do feedback-forms get redirected into /dev/null ?). I can imagine they get tons of crap (if you look at all the redundant 'feature-requests' in the wishlist which are already implemented for example), but that's really no excuse.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone here (the mods?) who can get up there and ring the bell?<br />
<br />
I had a huge AVS wishlist a while ago as well, but seeing no way to get it to them, I just tossed it in the bin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">We can't really go around deleting user accounts just because they're talking in your reviews section.  The star ratings are good, so what's really wrong?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I am the one who had reviewed (put a comment) you Whacko III pack. I know it would be a good thing if there was an e-mail address in the comment! I mean this: You could send e-mail to the one who has wroted the comment!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">that could go downhill very quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Obviously you misunderstood... I don't mind the comments, I just think it sucks that they have to be there where obviously almost no-one will read them. It's not about the ratings.<br />
<br />
Maybe a direct email link wouldn't be a good idea (can you say &quot;Automated Email Grabbing&quot;), but how about an inbetween &quot;profile&quot; page where you can view a user's submissions and find a link to his email address. That would discourage automated email grabbing, but still allow a person to reach him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The main problem I can see with that is thousands of e-mails reading:<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean my presets are only worth 4 stars?  You bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then again, it would very much discourage downrating.  Liek Jones's article ( http://www.winamp.com/news.jhtml;$sessionid$C0NEU1AAAVPGNTN24GBBC0A?articleid=9163 )</div></div><hr />
