<br />
Wonder if theres anyone out there Crazy enough to like my Works! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Well i think i could say &quot;myself&quot; , because if there were a artist that has the exactly same taste than me i would only let him/her to do the work and only enjoy the presets :p<br />
<br />
Anyway... any other... well my devart page says El-vis, but his hardly involved anymore... he does make some presets now and then, but otherwise his pretty quiet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I could also say myself because nearly no AVS-Artist (that i know, and i don't know many) does RotoMirroring, Flashing Presets :D <br />
<br />
But i like anything that morph and morhs and keeps an morphing so you can stare on it for ages...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Morphing isnt too possible in AVS, my most morphy presets are Dragonscopin, and Deviant's Revenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th February 2003, 09:26</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">A simple method is to fix the Camera on lets say a fifth of the original screen and then do various scrollings and movements. It can be done with a good combination of DM's (Dynamic Morphements :D)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I love myself ! My style aint unique or it isnt the best but i like my presets most...Maybe because i did them :) Anyway i like fsk`s and MaxPudding`s work a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">ches: morphing is extremely easy, if you know the techniques involved.  zap3 has a bunch, lilbuddy's done a couple, and i did a really cool 3d one in tff1<br />
<br />
i'd have to say my favorite ARTIST would be somewhere between gonzalo/zamuz and nic01 :) i dunno about &quot;favorite avser&quot; tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">28th February 2003, 22:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I have none really, they all (And I mean the good ones) make great presets.<br />
<br />
But for the top, it's a match between UnConeD, Zevensoft, Duo, SKuperS(can't get the capping right...), Jheriko, and the list continues...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Myself.<br />
Number 2 goes to UnConed.<br />
Number 3 is split among many many people(basically anyone who has advanced beyond n00bish presets).</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1) UnconeD. he is the best.<br />

<div class="posttext">i don't watch presets too often, just make my own.  if i do, it is usually the better artists: jheriko, UnConeD, El-vis, duo, tuggummi</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">By Morphing I mean like, True morphing like Preset into Preset, Like the stuff that Windows Media Player can do that AVS cant, true randomisation of Presets and mixing/matching. AVS CANNOT do that. You know what I mean. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd March 2003, 05:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">AVS can do true morphing.  See UnConeD's Geiss preset in his last pack for one example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Zevensoft</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd March 2003, 06:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Some of my favourites.<br />
<br />
UnConeD: For his innovative ideas and APE programming.<br />
Atero: For creating life in AVS.<br />
Jheriko: For outstanding use of maths in AVS<br />
uNDefineD: For making a stick figure that COULD ACTUALLY DANCE and not just wave about :D<br />
Yothoso/killahbite: For having such professional presentation skills.<br />
El-vis: For being one of the first to be innovative.<br />
Pak-9: For putting .bmps to excellent use.<br />
<br />
And of course those who just make good presets: Tuggumi, Nic01, Skupers, and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">zamuz</div><div class="date small text-muted">2nd March 2003, 17:40</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Definetely fsk. His ideas and the way he executes them are unique. I also like a lot Degnic's and Yathosho's work. Design and color manipulations are what I like most on presets.</div></div><hr />

I wish this board had the laughing smiley. :D<br />
<br />
EL-VIS - excellent preset ideas, and makes them run flawlessly<br />
skupers - just plain old &quot;makes good stuff&quot;<br />
Tuggummi - ditto (also friendly :))<br />
Nic01 - ditto again, and a big help to all around him<br />
jheriko - anyone who lives by his &quot;everything around us can be explained in numbers&quot; philosophy has to be doing something right :D<br />
Zevensoft - innovative, and great coder (and fellow Aussie)<br />
UnConeD - you all know why</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just out of interest - are there any chicks in this forum? It seems to have an uncanny male flavour about it?<br />
Mines elvis. He has a nice artistic flair. Making a preset is one thing. Making it look good is another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, everyone mentioned everyone else . . . so my pick has to go to:<br />
<br />
Tuomas!<br />
<br />
He was a huge inspiration for me &amp; was one of the first members of the AVSociety to leave AVS all together.  To this day he has some presets that no one else could possibly match.  Check out The Presets v. 3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Another person that made some great presets in his day: Paranoya.  Several of my presets look very similar to his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">6th March 2003, 12:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Paranoya has some sick scopes (sick meaning good) , but his preset are pretty much all the same... They are cool tho, but i don't advice to copycat paranoya...<br />
<br />
As for nimrodfunk... never heard :igor: Could someone point me into the general direction, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, atero i haven't been here in a while since that buggy thing here wouldn't recognize either my pass or the pass it sends me for a while. before that i used to come here quite often. I actually made a lot of posts then. something like 5 :rolleyes: :D. <br />
 And, Tug, i ain't givin you the links cos you won't like them, and if you don't like them you will see the similarities with mine and won't like mine. Well let's see ...<br />
http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/browse.jhtml;$sessionid$WLITFQYQ1O0LHTN241GBCYY<br />
Try the one in the middle. If the link won't work try searching &quot;Psychephilia&quot; in the classic winamp site (above on the right kid :) ). I see there can be found quite some interesting things in the classic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I like very original &amp; visually well made presets. Duo,NemoOrange,Tuggummi,FSK,El-vis,jheriko, Unconed, Yathosho and some others are very good AVSsers, but the one who gets my vote is Evilrice. He can do Really original and amazing presets &amp; he is definetly the best remixer around there.</div></div><hr />
