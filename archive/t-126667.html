      <p class="post-content">Well i think i could say "myself" , because if there were a artist that has the exactly same taste than me i would only let him/her to do the work and only enjoy the presets :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway... any other... well my devart page says El-vis, but his hardly involved anymore... he does make some presets now and then, but otherwise his pretty quiet.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I could also say myself because nearly no AVS-Artist (that i know, and i don't know many) does RotoMirroring, Flashing Presets :D<br />
      <br />
      But i like anything that morph and morhs and keeps an morphing so you can stare on it for ages...</p>

      <p class="post-content">A simple method is to fix the Camera on lets say a fifth of the original screen and then do various scrollings and movements. It can be done with a good combination of DM's (Dynamic Morphements :D)</p>

      <p class="post-content">ches: morphing is extremely easy, if you know the techniques involved. zap3 has a bunch, lilbuddy's done a couple, and i did a really cool 3d one in tff1<br />
      <br />
      i'd have to say my favorite ARTIST would be somewhere between gonzalo/zamuz and nic01 :) i dunno about "favorite avser" tho</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have none really, they all (And I mean the good ones) make great presets.<br />
      <br />
      But for the top, it's a match between UnConeD, Zevensoft, Duo, SKuperS(can't get the capping right...), Jheriko, and the list continues...</p>

      <p class="post-content">By Morphing I mean like, True morphing like Preset into Preset, Like the stuff that Windows Media Player can do that AVS cant, true randomisation of Presets and mixing/matching. AVS CANNOT do that. You know what I mean. :D</p>

      UnConeD: For his innovative ideas and APE programming.<br />
      Atero: For creating life in AVS.<br />
      Jheriko: For outstanding use of maths in AVS<br />
      uNDefineD: For making a stick figure that COULD ACTUALLY DANCE and not just wave about :D<br />
      Yothoso/killahbite: For having such professional presentation skills.<br />
      El-vis: For being one of the first to be innovative.<br />
      Pak-9: For putting .bmps to excellent use.<br />
      <br />
      And of course those who just make good presets: Tuggumi, Nic01, Skupers, and more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Definetely fsk. His ideas and the way he executes them are unique. I also like a lot Degnic's and Yathosho's work. Design and color manipulations are what I like most on presets.</p>

      <br />
      EL-VIS - excellent preset ideas, and makes them run flawlessly<br />
      skupers - just plain old "makes good stuff"<br />
      Tuggummi - ditto (also friendly :))<br />
      Nic01 - ditto again, and a big help to all around him<br />
      jheriko - anyone who lives by his "everything around us can be explained in numbers" philosophy has to be doing something right :D<br />
      Zevensoft - innovative, and great coder (and fellow Aussie)<br />
      UnConeD - you all know why

      He was a huge inspiration for me &amp; was one of the first members of the AVSociety to leave AVS all together. To this day he has some presets that no one else could possibly match. Check out The Presets v. 3.</p>

      Well, atero i haven't been here in a while since that buggy thing here wouldn't recognize either my pass or the pass it sends me for a while. before that i used to come here quite often. I actually made a lot of posts then. something like 5 :rolleyes: :D.<br />
      And, Tug, i ain't givin you the links cos you won't like them, and if you don't like them you will see the similarities with mine and won't like mine. Well let's see ...<br />
      <a href="http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/browse.jhtml;" target="_blank">http://classic.winamp.com/plugins/browse.jhtml;</a>$sessionid$WLITFQYQ1O0LHTN241GBCYY<br />
      Try the one in the middle. If the link won't work try searching "Psychephilia" in the classic winamp site (above on the right kid :) ). I see there can be found quite some interesting things in the classic.</p>

Duo,NemoOrange,Tuggummi,FSK,El-vis,jheriko, Unconed, Yathosho and some others are very good AVSsers, but the one who gets my vote is Evilrice. He can do Really original and amazing presets &amp; he is definetly the best remixer around there.</p>
