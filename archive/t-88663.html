      <p class="post-content"><strong>probably a simple question</strong><br />
      When you are rendering things in avs, how do you make it to where on effect or transition effects one thing and a different one efects another rendering?<br />
      <br />
      For example. I made a particle and a text field. And let's say I want the movement for the particle to be x=x+0.02 and I want the movement for the text to be y=y+0.02 . When I try this I end up getting the two movement commands to both work on the text field. Is this what Effects lists are for? If so, could someone elaborate?<br />
      <br />
      Thanks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You need to learn how to use Effect Lists. They are basically a preset-in-a-preset. Each effect list has its own internal buffer, and it loops inside itself each frame.<br />
      <br />
      When AVS encounters an Effect list, it puts the current image into the Effect list using the selected Input method (or not when 'Ignore' is selected).<br />
      When AVS has finished the Effect list, the result is copied back into the main preset using the selected Output method (or not when 'Ignore' is selected);</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wow, I don't know what is more impressive, the speed of this reply or that you could read my original post with so many typos.<br />
      <br />
      I kind of understand what you are saying. I am enjoying learning how to do stuff with AVS. I have been doing a lot of programming with Macromedia Flash lately involving placing simple objects over and over with trig, so when my brother showed me this plugin I was awed.<br />
      <br />
      Is there a thread or place I can go to to learn more about effects lists and other avs stuff? I checked out the oned in the faq and made the little expanding circle with the superscope that was in one of the suggested threads(I believe with your tute).<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, thanks for the guidance.</p>
