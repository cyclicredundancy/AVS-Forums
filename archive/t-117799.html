<br />
<div class="posttext">In General Discussions (or somewhere), I saw a poll on top forum member of the month.<br />
<br />
I thought it would be nice to see a top member of the month for the AVS forum.  Post your nominations here, and I will create a poll in a couple weeks or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
I nominate UnConed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th December 2002, 17:12</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Just give the award to UnConeD, he has contributed the most to AVS out of anyone, by a large scale factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">14th December 2002, 23:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Why don't we just disqualify UnConeD cos it wouldn't be a fair contest otherwise :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th December 2002, 01:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Well, as Jheriko said, UnConed will win, so maybe UnConed should be automatically given the grand prize for his contributions and this be a contest to see who wins other than UnConed.  (so for first runner up).<br />
<br />
If you think this is a good or bad idea, say so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th December 2002, 23:37</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">We could do that... but shouldn't we keep the rivalry to the presets in order to make them better, and not let it spill over to the forums where we generally help each other out and stuff?<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th December 2002, 02:35</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I was thinking more of a combination...who has contributed the most in AVS presets (quality) and has contributed the most to the forum, such as helpful source code (such as the things listed under the AVS Hints and Tricks (or whatever it is called) to allow others to create better AVSs.<br />
<br />
This should not be just the number of posts overall, but the number of quality posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i vote Gourmet. He was the first person I ever saw do good VU meters in AVS. Also, he has made a few suggestions as to things he'd like to see in AVS - granted, some of them seem idiotic to a lot of people here, but I myself would like to see at least a few of these things (I kind of like the idea of window snapping - you set the width and height that a window needs to be with it, and when the preset is loaded, it &quot;snaps&quot; to those dimensions. Might also be useful in fullscreen mode, to preserve aspect ratios!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th December 2002, 17:48</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Nic01, since he's the one that's helped me most with AVS aesthetics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th December 2002, 00:00</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I would also vote for Nic01, he seems to help out the most relative to his total post count. He also has an incredible grasp of mathematics and aesthetics for his age.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clashman, you can preserve aspect ratios in code fine, the crappy built in effects are another story though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm... I don't know... I think i would vote for Jheriko, because of the wicked ssc's he has been showing us and he has contributed to the forums quite a lot. And did Jheriko made J6&amp;J7 both in the same month? That's a lot of presets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">mikm</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th December 2002, 22:02</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">OK, so far: (this is more for me to speed up counting...)<br />
Gourmet: 1<br />
Nic01: 2<br />
Jheriko: 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nic01</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st December 2002, 00:55</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I vote Jheriko. He just kicks ass, all other reasons would take too long to type (Damn comp time curfew...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">For reasons already stated, I vote for jheriko.</div></div><hr />
