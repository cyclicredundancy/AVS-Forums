      <p class="post-content"><strong>First 3d preset XD</strong><br />
      Hello :) I've been mucking around with AVS presets for while, but I didn't do anything 3d stuff mostly becuase they seemed like alot of effort, and i cbf :p .<br />
      <br />
      But recently I came across these forums, and looking at some people's explanations (like Atero's primer) made me see that the maths behind the basic stuff was not that difficult. That, along with the fact that alot of the 3d presets out there look really cool, so I decided to put in the effort to make my own :D.<br />
      <br />
      I've attached what I made, it took the better part of a day to complete -__-. Any critisism is welcome, preferably construtive critisism :). Any tips on bad habits i should drop before continuing, or ways of doings things better are also appreciated. I might try figuring out 3d DMs later, but for the moment superscopes are enough of a challenge :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is the best first attempt at 3D I've seen in a while. It could use a few optimizes though. Generally, if you repeat the same calculationmore than once, you should assign a variable to it so AVS only does the calculation once.<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>//Example: (lines of longitude)<br />Old:<br /><font color="blue">tf=t*ntf</font>; sf=s*nsf;<br />x1=<font color="red">sin(tf)</font>*cos(sf);<br />y1=<font color="red">sin(tf)</font>*sin(sf);<br />Suggestion:<br /><font color="purple">stf=sin(t*ntf)</font>;sf=s*nsf;<br />x1=<font color="purple">stf</font>*cos(sf);<br />x1=<font color="purple">stf</font>*sin(sf);</code>
</pre><br />
      Also, you need a lot of work on the 2D aspects of the preset. Your background is too simple, and it doesn't fill in all the empty space. I'd suggest a synced 3D DM or a red grid with blue lines on it, like the sphere.<br />
      One more thing, try to make the beams look lie they extend out infinitely by making them twice as long and reducing their brightness as they go farther from the center.
