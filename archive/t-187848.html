      Well here it is, i've finally finished.<br />
      Some of you will know these presets from my forum posts, but most of them have been updated several times.<br />
      Tell me what you think and most of all, enjoy!</p>

      <p class="post-content">having that quantity of presets, you could've been more selective quality-wise. <i>fractal</i> is a good example for that. i've seen that kind of preset 100 times already.. 3 years ago.<br />
      <br />
      favourite is definitely <i>bee</i>, nice and simple.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Huge pack indeed - I agree with Yathosho here- the junk should have been left out, it really takes down on the overall rating. 2 stars now, 3-3.5 stars otherwise<br />
      Best ones:<br />
      - Neon This<br />
      - MEHTB</p>
