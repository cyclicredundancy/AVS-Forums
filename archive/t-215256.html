      <p class="post-content"><strong>Community Picks AVS Pack</strong><br />
      A while ago, when Steve was still around, there was talk of including a Community Picks AVS Preset Pack with the default Winamp distro. Well, this project is now officially alive again, and Tag Loomis would like to know which ones, where they are, etc etc, for inclusion with Winamp 5.10. Thanks.<br />
      <br />
      Edit &gt; hmm, or is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=144659" target="_blank">this</a> it? (no, it isn't, heh) :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Wonderful idea! The first thing I thought of were the new Forums Compilations. The second one is still in the making and probably won't be finalized until the beginning of June, but I think that would be a great addition.<br />
      <br />
      /Edit<br />
      I see you've just found the first one. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think he's talking about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=180130&amp;highlight=community+picks" target="_blank">this community pack</a>, which was meant to be a replacement for the 'newpicks' folder included with the winamp installation, it contained presets picked by the avs community. you should contact unconed about this, since he was the one organizing the whole thing. the actual pack is not on that thread though, only the results of the voting. good to know that pack isn't going to waste, after all :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">yes, zamuz is pointing to correct pack (afaik).<br />
      <br />
      ignore denkensiefursic, Winamp Forum Compilations are just regular packs full of average presets (no offence anybody, there are great presets innit, but weak ones aswell) and are not intended to be included with official version of winamp.</p>

      <p class="post-content">don`t get me wrong, i would simply not want that pack in official version of winamp, it`s simply not good enough.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sadly I have to agree with Zamuz..<br />
      <br />
      the Winamp Forums Compilation (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=212154" target="_blank">#2</a> is currently under construction) was started to show what's the <b>newest</b> from the current members on this AVS-forum.<br />
      It was never created to replace the forumpicks list.<br />
      <br />
      The other one is a <i>collection of the best presets over all time</i> from everywhere (winamp.com, deviantart, deskmod when it was still alive, etc).<br />
      <br />
      But 24 times yay for this!</p>

      <p class="post-content">we really need the good (recent community made) picks in winamp... instead of the crappy old ones :/<br />
      <br />
      if someone just needs the presets and cant contact coned for whatever reason i have them all (i d/led the finished list - i'm sure others have them too...). <a href="mailto:jheriko@gmail.com">jheriko@gmail.com</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is the ZIP containing the 50 best presets as voted by the community (the original selection contained 118 presets by the way):<br />
      <a href="http://www.acko.net/dumpx/Community%20Picks.zip" target="_blank">http://www.acko.net/dumpx/Community%20Picks.zip</a><br />
      <br />
      The whole zip should be extracted into the AVS folder (plugins\avs). So the APE and BMP files go into the main AVS dir, while the presets themselves go into the Community Picks subfolder (plugins\avs\Community Picks).<br />
      <br />
      I didn't include the APEs that are already included with Winamp5.<br />
      <br />
      PS: Everyone in this pack gave permission to be included with Winamp many moons ago, I took care of all that. It's as ready to go into Winamp5 as it was <i>10 months ago</i>.</p>
