<br />
<div class="posttext">Let's start with the intro.<br />
<br />
Focal Point 2 - Make it first. Just copy all the files into a new directory with that one first. It seems to me that AVS organized files by date created.<br />
- It could be made more interesting by adding something that moves to the transparancy of the white.<br />
- I recognized the swirly stuff in the background ;)<br />
<br />
Anothe Acid Trip - Nice, but some more changes to the motion wouldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Daisy Chain biPolar Psycle mix - Oww, my eyes.<br />
- Just personal preference, but I like to put mixes after originals.<br />
<br />
Daisy Chain - I like this one. I'm a sucker for good use of pastel colours.<br />
- Combine the brightness filters for more speed. (it picked up 2 FPS for me)<br />
<br />
Faded Glory Burned Mix - The colour reduction works for this one. I like it better than the original.<br />
<br />
Faded Glory - Sometimes it can be a bit bright. It might work better with a darker shade of blue.<br />
<br />
Going Blind - I don't know why, but I like it. Usually, I don't like that kind of preset (not much movement). &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
Ruffles - This one seemed kind of plain. It didn't hold my interest.<br />
<br />
Starlight Circut - I liked the snowflakes, or whatever thay are supposed to be.<br />
- Liked it better with invert off.<br />
<br />
Overall - Nice variety so far.<br />
- Some presets could benefit from some random movements.<br />
- A very bright pack. Too much white for my taste.</div></div><hr />
