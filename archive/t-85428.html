      This is just a preview of my second AVS pack "Focal Point 2: Softlight". I was hoping for some suggestions or advice.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Let's start with the intro.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Focal Point 2</font> - Make it first. Just copy all the files into a new directory with that one first. It seems to me that AVS organized files by date created.<br />
      - It could be made more interesting by adding something that moves to the transparancy of the white.<br />
      - I recognized the swirly stuff in the background ;)<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Anothe Acid Trip</font> - Nice, but some more changes to the motion wouldn't hurt.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Daisy Chain biPolar Psycle mix</font> - Oww, my eyes.<br />
      - Just personal preference, but I like to put mixes after originals.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Daisy Chain</font> - I like this one. I'm a sucker for good use of pastel colours.<br />
      - Combine the brightness filters for more speed. (it picked up 2 FPS for me)<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Faded Glory Burned Mix</font> - The colour reduction works for this one. I like it better than the original.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Faded Glory</font> - Sometimes it can be a bit bright. It might work better with a darker shade of blue.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Going Blind</font> - I don't know why, but I like it. Usually, I don't like that kind of preset (not much movement). &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Ruffles</font> - This one seemed kind of plain. It didn't hold my interest.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Starlight Circut</font> - I liked the snowflakes, or whatever thay are supposed to be.<br />
      - Liked it better with invert off.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Overall</font> - Nice variety so far.<br />
      - Some presets could benefit from some random movements.<br />
      - A very bright pack. Too much white for my taste.</p>
