      <p class="post-content"><strong>slow</strong><br />
      Geez-that preset has a slow fps. I only got 6 FPS fullscreen. But it's pretty good. How long have you been messing around in AVS before you joined the forums?<br />
      <br />
      One suggestion: Try the custom BPM-that way you can make it so everybody sees it at the speed you want.<br />
      <br />
      Good job</p>

      <p class="post-content">The effect lists do exactly nothing, you can move everything out of them. Remember, an effect list is only useful when you want to have a preset-inside-a-preset, but when your entire preset is in an effect list, it usually has no purpose.<br />
      <br />
      Your main problem is that you just seem to have thrown a bunch of things together. Now you need to try and get the same effect (or something close to it), but by only keeping the effects that actually do something. Most components have virtually no effect on the end-result in your preset (e.g. the Trans / Bump).<br />
      <br />
      Don't expect to be come an AVS expert in one day... but if you stick to it and keep trying out new things, you'll figure it out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It does look very cool, but there are so many different effects in it that it is slowing it down like everybody said. I had to really turn it small before i got it at the speed i think you wanted it to.</p>
