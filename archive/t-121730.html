<div class="posttext">Is there anything wrong with that superscope because I know there is something wrong with it... Or there's something missing (other than more trans's) Can point somin out for me please.:igor:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here is some stuff for you to improve on.<br />
1. It's not very beat responsive.<br />
2. The colors aren't that great.<br />
3. The dots follow a fixed path.<br />
<br />
Change this stuff some and it might turn out well.  Repost it if you change anything - it does have some potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Dots are hard to make look good, good work, keep makin avs, also experiment more wirh simple DMs and the built-ins when youve made your supsescopes, its not hard to get what you want, all that is is a brightness and a blitter feedback in a couple of effect lists. Anyways still good work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">oh come on, all youve done is change the colours on the default superscope and used a colorfade, you can do better than that. :p<br />
and the first colour clip dosent seem to do anything, well anything that makes more than a very slight difference to the end result.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">nice work, good colours. Could use a little something else, not sure what but nice work anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Better than the original.  The SSC is still kinda boring(try making it move in waves).  The smoke effect is nice - use a more dynamic movement with it.  Right now the movement is repetitive and doesn't move that far from the SSC.  Also, try changing the color after the movements using a channel shift or the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 02:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">i messed around with a load of built in effects, its basically a different preset but it uses the superscopes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 02:33</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Raz, I like it when it turns to the colors except for the obviousness of the 5 pointed distro(not too bad, but would like to see something else).  However, when it is just the dots, it is kinda boring.  Good remix though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st January 2003, 02:38</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah it was just a 2 minute play with the built ins to show what you can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Kid, what is it supposed to be exactly?  The color clip doesn't do anything and the blur isn't needed. Also, the water bump makes it look kinda weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">KiD cHaMeLeOn</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 15:33</div></div>

<div class="posttext">I thought you liked snow? It's actually snowing right now in southern virginia (Cape Hatteras NC is getting about 15&quot;). It's great, There is only have about 2&quot; of snow in my area, but the schools are shut down today!! Virginians do not know how to drive.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 16:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I dont relly like that the way it is, id get rid of the effects like roto blitter, blur etc etc... its looks better with just the colorfade, dynamic shift and superscope and id work on the superscope so that the ends meet, so its like a whole circle type continuous line thing... you get my meaning, (i have a hard time putting things into words) and then just add a DM or something for background effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 17:14</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">maybe something a little like this, but... good. this is just a 2 minute fuckabout with the superscope, make a smooth superscope and maybe make the colours go to the centre of the shape thing, sort of like an amobea or something, just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 17:24</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Don't really like the colors raz. Also, the SSC isn't very dynamic, but with some on beat changes and such it will look a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Raz</div><div class="date small text-muted">23rd January 2003, 17:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yeah i was just using simple SS techniques to convey what i was trying to say further, just a 2 minute mess with it</div></div><hr />
