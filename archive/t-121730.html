      <p class="post-content">Here is some stuff for you to improve on.<br />
      1. It's not very beat responsive.<br />
      2. The colors aren't that great.<br />
      3. The dots follow a fixed path.<br />
      <br />
      Change this stuff some and it might turn out well. Repost it if you change anything - it does have some potential.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Dots are hard to make look good, good work, keep makin avs, also experiment more wirh simple DMs and the built-ins when youve made your supsescopes, its not hard to get what you want, all that is is a brightness and a blitter feedback in a couple of effect lists. Anyways still good work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">oh come on, all youve done is change the colours on the default superscope and used a colorfade, you can do better than that. :p<br />
      and the first colour clip dosent seem to do anything, well anything that makes more than a very slight difference to the end result.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Better than the original. The SSC is still kinda boring(try making it move in waves). The smoke effect is nice - use a more dynamic movement with it. Right now the movement is repetitive and doesn't move that far from the SSC. Also, try changing the color after the movements using a channel shift or the like.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Raz, I like it when it turns to the colors except for the obviousness of the 5 pointed distro(not too bad, but would like to see something else). However, when it is just the dots, it is kinda boring. Good remix though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I dont relly like that the way it is, id get rid of the effects like roto blitter, blur etc etc... its looks better with just the colorfade, dynamic shift and superscope and id work on the superscope so that the ends meet, so its like a whole circle type continuous line thing... you get my meaning, (i have a hard time putting things into words) and then just add a DM or something for background effects.</p>

      <p class="post-content">maybe something a little like this, but... good. this is just a 2 minute fuckabout with the superscope, make a smooth superscope and maybe make the colours go to the centre of the shape thing, sort of like an amobea or something, just an idea.</p>
