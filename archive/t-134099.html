		Well you've got further than a lot of noobs by not giving us all a seizure ;) good job for that. This is a good noob preset because i can see you're experimenting with movements. Try to experiment with some simple scopes next. Have a look around the forums for tutorials. The tips and tricks threads in the main forum would be a good place to start. Ateros primer, soon to be updated for the past six months. <br />
<br />
Some tips: &quot;i&quot; is only a set variable in scopes. It doesn't do anything in movements unless you set a variable with the name &quot;i&quot;. A unique tone tone sets the tone for things before it in the list so it doesn't do anything at the start. I suspect you want the screen to start orange so you want a render/clear screen to start.<br />
<br />
Overall it's a very noob preet but it's watchable and not stupidly fast or bright. keep avsing and welcome to the forums :)
