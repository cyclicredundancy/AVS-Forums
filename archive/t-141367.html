<div class="posttext">Just wondering.... <br />
Where did you guys learn such coding skills?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The AVS programming language is very simple, if you could call it a language.  You can probably learn that in less than an hour just by looking at the explanations contained in AVS.  Do you mean where we learned the math?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First &quot;programming language&quot; (NOT!) that I got to.<br />
I learned it through a good amount of tinkering (past, future if 3.0 comes out), a little research on functions (juuust past, too lazy in present), and a looking at outside knowledge (past, present, future).<br />
<br />
Still yet to seriously create something in AVS though (other than Beat Counter)...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Me? Learn AVS? Pah! I couldnt make a superscope from scratch! Well, maybe i could but it would be a line or dot or curved line or something... i mostly do remixes  and try to understnad the code in other's scopes and dms</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Note that purely learning AVS coding won't go terribly far - There's this thing called aesthetics you know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Math classes, physics classes, online research, book research, etc.  Not to learn AVS, but to learn how to do different things(i.e. simulate collisions) and then I implement it in AVS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Screwing around with the various renders and trans's to see what it does, then started typing nonsense code, which sometimes didn't even look that bad, then started picking other peoples presets apart. Now I'm trying things on my own, simple and a little harder coding. When I run into a problem I just ask here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">One of my personal favorites had a movement that was basically random code(I started with something real, but then I just screwed around a lot).  The chaotic flowers preset(available at http://anubis2003.deviantart.com) has a completely random movement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tugg i will beat your 4 years! ;) <br />
 I learned how to use AVS by reading Atero`s primer,searching the forums for basic (and advanced sometimes) stuff and disecting other people`s code. Ishan stop posting with 2 different names! Its confusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">The code is pretty basic... I programmed BASIC and C++ before I started on AVS so the expression help was all I needed... the rest is all 2D/3D(/nD if I wanted to) geometry, which is good for me since I'm doing a degree in maths. Most of my 'advanced' AVS knowledge comes from a combination of me working stuff out for myself mathematically or from UnConeD. <br />
<br />
Most people that have trouble when they try to jump into coding AVS don't seem to have any idea of how programming works and so they just can't understand why things work how they do and why their code is pointless/redundant/broken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">what i'm amazed by though is how you can convert stuff you've seen in a forum thread into something compleately original (although most of the time...)<br />
<br />
it baffles me to see that, even though i know the equations (just, and improving all the time), people like El-Vis and UnConeD are creating wonders of mathematics!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Tugg, you are, IMO, the greatest at aesthetics.  You have an amazing sense of style &lt;insert wrist flip&gt;.  This is why we wanted you to join in the AVS tourny.<br />
<br />
[offtopic]You may not want to put that +1 postcount thing anymore.  Will is resetting the postcount of anyone who puts &quot;post_count++&quot; in their posts.  Wait, dammit:p ).</div></div><hr />
