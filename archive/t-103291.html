			<strong>Still making things...</strong><br />
		
		

		Yay, my first 3D DM. :D<br />
<br />
Made this in about 15 minutes. I still need to mess with it a bit, but it ain't too bad. I want to add movement and maybe the ability to swoop down towards one on the planes. (or maybe I'm dreaming)<br />
<br />
I felt I needed something to top off my pre-birthday gift to my girlfriend. (the real one isn't done yet :( )

		Umm, where's the preset? :confused:<br />
<br />
Hmm, gift for a girlfriend? Hope she'll like it!<br />
<br />
(If this preset becomes succesful to his girlfriend, we've just got another good reason to use AVS)

		AVS - making you more attractive to the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, AVS is a pretty good way to impress people. My girlfriend uses my presets, and provides inspirational feedback which leads to better presets, so i can't lose.<br />
<br />
Just the other day she asked how many downloads i've had. For some reason the thought that 20,000 people might be looking at something i made makes her proud of me. (The fact that half the people who download my stuff are greasy little nerds seems to have no detrimental effect.)

		Damnit. I wish prewiew didn't nuke the attachment list. That's the only reason I can think it didn't show. :mad:<br />
<br />
She did like it, :up: but it gave her mom vertigo. :down:

		That is, until your girlfriend discovers how to make her own AVS presets and turns out to be better than you :).

		Messed with it a bit. Now the planes move and their distance from the camera (for lack of a better way to explain) changes. :up: The changes in rotation and movement have been smoothed out too. :)<br />
<br />
Any remixes?

		nice dm, nice effects, nice idea. thought id post up a (hopefully) nice remix... (you can always steal it and claim it as your own, i don't mind) just some basic changes, replaced those planes with some dynamic curves (using some simple trig) added some more reactivity and well changed the whole thing pretty much, all thats relatively intact is the dm which i modified rather than built from scratch (since you do things differently to me i thought i'd modify your code to make it easier for you to see where i changed things).<br />
<br />
just reformatted my computer AGAIN (no 8 now for the last 24 hrs) and again the first thing i did was come straight here (well after all my setup for my connection)<br />
<br />
anyway, enough ranting... enjoy :)

		Not a bad mix Jeriko. I was trying for some distortion of the planes when you posted it. :) I finished that in class. Now to try and write the message in a superscope...<br />
<br />
Hope you get your computer working again.

			<strong>finally...</strong><br />
		
		

		yep just fixed it good and proper, nothing like a good old fashioned pre-format - fdisk - format - win98fe - win2k server advanced installation, best way to fix anything :P yeh i'll check out your preset after i've finished d/loading wa3. which should take all of about 1 minute :)

		Just messing a bit and this happened. Thought it was kinda nifty. :)<br />
<br />
BTW. UnConed, I'm putting my GF's new computer together. Now we'll see what she can do. :) (they're going to a 1300MHZ Duron from a 486DX/33)
