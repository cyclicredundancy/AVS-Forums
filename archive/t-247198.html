      <p class="post-content"><strong>Full screen AVS with left mouse button?</strong><br />
      AVS is set as my default vis for my CarPC and I was wondering if there was anyway to get it to go fullscreen with 2 left mouse taps. Using a touch screen so there is no right or left mouse per say, but tapping the screen=left mouse button.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you</p>

      <p class="post-content">In the editor go to Settings -&gt; Fullscreen and check "Doubleclick in main window goes fullscreen (instead of config)"<br />
      <br />
      That should do it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm&#226;&#8364;&#166;what is the latest version of AVS? I ask because there doesn't seem to be that option under Fullscreen with mine. I have v2.6.1, that&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s what came with Winamp 2.95. I&#226;&#8364;&#8482;m using the older version of Winamp as it's smaller and more stable, also the recommended version to use with my front end, Road Runner.<br />

      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Visualization_Studio" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance...ization_Studio</a><br />
      <br />
      So it will work with older versions of winamp?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Well, I have it working with v2.95, but one small issue remains. It won't go full screen consistenly by double clicking in the vis window. It will do it every time if I right click-&gt;full screen. Any ideas?:igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">avs 2.81b wont work with winamp2, because of the skinning and all that...<br />
      it's been tested a lot of times<br />
      <br />
      btw, frontends for winamp2 should also work with winamp5, since winamp5 was developed from winamp2, not from winamp3</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah Road Runner will work with winamp 5, but there are performance and stability issues.<br />
      <br />
      This is on a car PC using a micro ITX board with a VIA C3 1Ghz processor, not exactly speedy.<br />
      <br />
      I was able to install v2.81b with Winamp 2.95 the only problem is the double click is inconsistent. We'll see how it reacts with the touch screen so far I've only tested this with the mouse.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for all the replies and suggestions, I appreciate them.</p>
