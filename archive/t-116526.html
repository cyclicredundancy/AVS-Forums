		I started using AVS around the begining of November. I have learned alot but I still have alot to learn. Check out these presets if you have some spare time and tell me what you think.

		Hey man, not bad. They are some good beginnings in there. Keep on experimenting, the where the best stuff comes from some times.

		Thanks, currently I atempting how to use dynamic movement and buffers. I have seached but I can't seem to find any good AVS tutorials that explain how to use dynamic movement or buffers (or blend modes for that matter) I anyone knows a good site I would apericiate it if you would tell mr them.

		Check unconed's FAQ. It's at the top of each AVS forum.

		Also, my AVS primer has a tutorial about using DMs, SSCs, and an explanation of most blend modes.  I'm currently working on re-writing it, since most of the stuff there was either wrong, vague, or rather unorthodox, but it should work :p<br />
Get it here: <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com/gallery/" target="_blank">http://atero.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br />
<br />
The blend modes I think I didn't explain:<br />
<br />
Max blend: The maximum between the old and new pictures.<br />
XOR blend: new=old+new-2*old*new

		Atero: please don't explain XOR using that complicated formula. It suggests that this operation is performed per color channel, which isn't the case.<br />
<br />
20 XOR 55 = 35<br />
and not<br />
20 XOR 55 = 20 + 55 - 2*20*55 = -2125<br />
<br />
It's not defined as such, because you're still thinking in a decimal system and how to explain it in terms you're familiar with. Binary math has a bitwise definition of XOR that says (0^0 = 0, 1^0 = 1, 0^1 = 1, 1^1 = 1, using ^ as the XOR operator) and nothing else.<br />
<br />
The XOR blendmode simply does a bitwise XOR for every color channel.<br />
<br />
For example RGB (20,40,60) XOR (144, 59, 0) = (132, 19, 60) because:<br />
<br />
20 ^ 144 = 00010100 ^ 10010000 = 10000100 = 132<br />
and so on.

		Ohhh...I didn't know that, honestly.  Thanx.<br />
<br />
But...doesn't XOR still have to be done per color channel?

		What I meant is, you make it sound as if the a*b-2*a*b is performed per color channel, which gives totally wrong results.<br />
<br />
And in fact because every bit is xored only with the matching bit in the argument, so you can XOR entire 32-bit pixels (and even 2 pixels packed as a 64-bit integer).

		Isn't the ^ (carat) symbol used for powers? Like x^2 is x squared, x^.5 is square root of x, x^-2.5 is the reciprocal of the square root of x times the square of x, x^y is x to the power of y.<br />
<br />
This follows the similar rules that / is divide and * is multiply.

		In C/C++, ^ is the XOR operator and ~ is the bitwise negation operator (effectively an XOR with 1111111111...), so I'm used to that.<br />
<br />
Though some math programs use it for power yes, and I've seen '**' used as well.
