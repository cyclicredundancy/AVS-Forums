<div class="posttext">I started using AVS around the begining of November. I have learned alot but I still have alot to learn. Check out these presets if you have some spare time and tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hey man, not bad. They are some good beginnings in there. Keep on experimenting, the where the best stuff comes from some times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks, currently I atempting how to use dynamic movement and buffers. I have seached but I can't seem to find any good AVS tutorials that explain how to use dynamic movement or buffers (or blend modes for that matter) I anyone knows a good site I would apericiate it if you would tell mr them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Check unconed's FAQ. It's at the top of each AVS forum.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Also, my AVS primer has a tutorial about using DMs, SSCs, and an explanation of most blend modes.  I'm currently working on re-writing it, since most of the stuff there was either wrong, vague, or rather unorthodox, but it should work :p<br />
Get it here: http://atero.deviantart.com/gallery/<br />
<br />
The blend modes I think I didn't explain:<br />
<br />
Max blend: The maximum between the old and new pictures.<br />
XOR blend: new=old+new-2*old*new</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero: please don't explain XOR using that complicated formula. It suggests that this operation is performed per color channel, which isn't the case.<br />
<br />
20 XOR 55 = 35<br />
and not<br />
20 XOR 55 = 20 + 55 - 2*20*55 = -2125<br />
<br />
It's not defined as such, because you're still thinking in a decimal system and how to explain it in terms you're familiar with. Binary math has a bitwise definition of XOR that says (0^0 = 0, 1^0 = 1, 0^1 = 1, 1^1 = 1, using ^ as the XOR operator) and nothing else.<br />
<br />
The XOR blendmode simply does a bitwise XOR for every color channel.<br />
<br />
For example RGB (20,40,60) XOR (144, 59, 0) = (132, 19, 60) because:<br />
<br />
20 ^ 144 = 00010100 ^ 10010000 = 10000100 = 132<br />
and so on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Ohhh...I didn't know that, honestly.  Thanx.<br />
<br />
But...doesn't XOR still have to be done per color channel?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">What I meant is, you make it sound as if the a*b-2*a*b is performed per color channel, which gives totally wrong results.<br />
<br />
And in fact because every bit is xored only with the matching bit in the argument, so you can XOR entire 32-bit pixels (and even 2 pixels packed as a 64-bit integer).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Isn't the ^ (carat) symbol used for powers? Like x^2 is x squared, x^.5 is square root of x, x^-2.5 is the reciprocal of the square root of x times the square of x, x^y is x to the power of y.<br />
<br />
This follows the similar rules that / is divide and * is multiply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">In C/C++, ^ is the XOR operator and ~ is the bitwise negation operator (effectively an XOR with 1111111111...), so I'm used to that.<br />
<br />
Though some math programs use it for power yes, and I've seen '**' used as well.</div></div><hr />
