		Me2 wanna record AVS to AVI, directly. Now I use Hypercam, but the quality is not very good, although I have fast 'puter and raid 0 hdd's. Come on u kewl nerds make this one (I read AVS-grabber or whatever) finally. THNX :p

		I dont know if this works but allways you can try.<br />
<br />
Put AVS into Fullscreen and put a Video Camera input to the Monitor output and record it...i dont know if it works but if it does you can watch AVS from TV...nice

			<strong>more trouble than it's worth?</strong><br />
		
		

		With the output to TV, you could record to a VHS tape. Hopefully your vid card has an input, because you can input from the tape/VHS. Then encode it on the hard drive to AVI.

			<strong>Working on it</strong><br />
		
		

		I'm working on AVSGrabber... it's an APE that you can insert on an arbitrary point in an AVS to grab the image to an .avi file. You can select any codec you have installed, but it's better to grab it uncompressed first and encode it later (so you don't slow down AVS while grabbing).<br />
<br />
It's almost finished, except the uncompressed data output is broken: it outputs 16-color quality images. Will try fixing it tomorrow.<br />

			<strong>Pretty much done</strong><br />
		
		

		There are 2 issues I still have:<br />
<br />
- Uncompressed video comes out as 16-color video.<br />
<br />
- Sometimes it fails to overwrite on an existing file you just recorded.<br />
<br />
Other than that it's pretty much done.

			<strong>avs saver</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi UNconeD<br />
<br />
I've started getting your 16 colour effect as well!<br />
<br />
It actually is nothing to do with the file, its just the way windows displays it-- i think there must be a wrong entry in the BITMAPINFOHEADER. it doesn't even show up on all machines. in any case if you view the avi in an editing package like virtualdub it looks perfect./<br />
<br />
Anyway if any of you want to sneak a preview of my saver plugin you can grab it here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dmc.dit.ie/pixelcorps/saver.ape" target="_blank">http://www.dmc.dit.ie/pixelcorps/saver.ape</a><br />
<br />
it crashes when finishing a save on some machines.<br />
<br />
I'd love to hear from you if you do try it (anyone)-<br />
<br />
I'd love to know if it works, what framerate you can get and the details of your machine- OS, directX/WMP version, amount of RAM etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to release it fully until i figure out the header and crashing issues.<br />
<br />
;) TIM<br />
<br />
ps do you have any ideas for how to do the sound recording thing? I think if one looks in the winamp SDK it will involve writing another plugin that shunts the audio to AVS.... which will probably hit performance badly. for now i'm gonna be filming the music/visuals together onto a camcorder, as a reference for syncing afterwards.

		hey montana -- 2 things<br />
<br />
1) of couse its gonna slow down avs- what do you expect, magic?<br />
<br />
2) if you bothered to read the mail you'd realise that the poor quality comes from windows media player not playing it back properly.<br />
<br />
and as for going back to try again- who do you think you are!?<br />

			<strong>Doesn't work with me :(</strong><br />
		
		

		I've just tested this APE but the AVI file it creates doesn't look like my preset at all I've attached an example of it with this msg. (rename it to .avi) This is what I get to see when I try to play the file. I run use Win ME on a P-III 450 mhz, 256 MB RAM, 32 MB Viper V770. If there's any more you'd like to know just let me hear it good luck with this APE. :)<br />
<br />
/EDIT<br />
hmmm the attaching here at winamp isn't working as it should if you give me your email I'll send it to you<br />

		hey Times2<br />
<br />
great! finally a tool for writing avs to disk<br />
<br />
my experience :<br />
<br />
- works, but winamp2.78 on windows xp (with asus geforce2 gts) crashes after stop recording, very annoying<br />
- it seems that pixel quality depends on how large u make the window<br />
- 16 colors could be, but I am little color blind, so I am not sure. I use nicemc plugin in winamp to play moviez<br />
<br />
keep on the great work!<br />

		Oh yeah and Montana38: Yes. It will slow AVS down. Nothing you can do about it so just shut up. The bad quality comes from Windows Media Player not playing it right. View it in VirtualDub instead.

			<strong>AVSGrabber</strong><br />
		
		

		I've finished up my version of an AVS2AVI APE... AVSGrabber.<br />
<br />
Known bugs:<br />
- The 'uncompressed = 16 colors'-bug.<br />
- Overwriting can sometimes fail if the file is in use.<br />
<br />
It's got a few more features than saver.ape, but you should try both.<br />
<br />
It's unsupported software: it shouldn't do any harm, but if it kills your mother by shooting a bolt of electricity through the screen, down the stairs, across the living room and into the kitchen, I won't be held responsable :). If you can't get it to work, tough. If you want to send in a bug report, please do, but only with enough information (system description, software used and try to pinpoint the how's and when's of the bug).<br />
<br />
It will, of course, slow down AVS a bit. That's because it has to convert and flip the 32-bit AVS data into 24-bit data before most codecs will accept it. I've found a way to avoid this, but then it'll only work on uncompressed output. Might consider implementing this later.<br />
<br />
Get it from: <a href="http://avs.acko.net/" target="_blank">http://avs.acko.net/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Note to Montana38: Don't say something is crap until you can do better. You probably have *no* idea what's going on when that AVI saver is doing things, but I can assure you it's not sitting idly having a cup of coffee. That's why it slows AVS down. By the way, you should try writing correct english sentences, not using stupid abbreviations (u ?) and using punctuation marks. It lessens the 10-year-old look.

			<strong>Sound recording</strong><br />
		
		

		Sound recording should be *very* tricky. I can see a few problems:<br />
<br />
- You can't grab the audio data through AVS (because it's just provided as a visualisation means rather than an exact signal). A DSP might work, but you have to take things like processing delays into account. Getting the audio over to the AVS would be problem too.<br />
<br />
- AVS doesn't maintain a constant framerate... synching sound to the images will almost never work completely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a solution that might be worth something:<br />
<br />
- Create both an AVS Grabber (ape) and a sound grabber (DSP or maybe output plug-in).<br />
- Make sure they start and stop at exactly the same time using a synching mechanism.<br />
- Use an editing program to multiplex the audio and video stream.

			<strong>AVI output beta 2</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi all, if you're interested I've beta 2 of MY output plugin ready for download ;)<br />
<br />
Major bugfixes, it also fixes the 16-colour problem (UNconeD: its a question of filling in all of the BITMAPINFOHEADER fields), and a bit of performance enhancement.<br />
<br />
Theres also a RAW mode which basically rips the AVS screen buffer as fast as possible, but as far as i can tell, only windows media player can understand it. (UnconeD: I presume this is what you have in mind for 32-bit files: great minds think alike?)<br />
<br />
As before you can download it from:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dmc.dit.ie/pixelcorps/saver.ape" target="_blank">http://www.dmc.dit.ie/pixelcorps/saver.ape</a><br />
<br />
UnconeD: As for the sound issue, as you say it might be possible to create a soundtrack from the vis data (it would be very low quiality). but for my purposes (using AVS to create effects for music videos) I'm quite happy to put in an effect that will let me recognise the start of the song and then just sync it up in premiere or digital fusion.

			<strong>No other APE's</strong><br />
		
		

		I haven't made any decent other APE's than AVSGrabber. First I tried making a 5x5 convolution matrix effect (like a custom filter, it allows you to define the color of a pixel in relation to itself and the 5x5 surrounding grid). Unfortunately it was very slow (I wrote it in assembly though) and slightly buggy. I simplified this to an Embossing filter which was still slow, but a bit faster. Never released either of them though, because they weren't near good.<br />
<br />
As far as the '32-bit' mode is concerned, I currently have a set of compiler-conditions that allows me to change the APE into two things:<br />
 - The AVS buffer is flipped vertically and converted from 32-bit to 24-bit. Almost any codec will accept this format.<br />
<br />
 - The AVS buffer is just kept the way it is (top-down and 32-bit). The only codec I think worked was uncompressed, and maybe DivX, not sure.<br />
<br />
I wanted to ask you if you used assembly and/or MMX in your APE's. I used regular x86 assembly (no MMX) here and there to speed things up, but nothing substantial really. You need to use MMX however to do fast operations on pixels, so that's why I still haven't released any custom filters yet (don't know MMX, if you have a good resource about it, please forward it). I don't have the code for my ape's here though (at univ atm), so I can't 'show you mine' :P.<br />
<br />
On to the issue of sound. I don't know how AVS works, but I do know how regular vis plug-ins work: WinAMP calls a function of the plug-in, equivalent to the render() method of an APE, every 'tick'. The traditional way of programming a plug-in was to draw everything on this 'tick'. Unfortunately this made the plug-in stop when you were inside a modal dialog or when music had stopped. The fact that AVS doesn't do this, means it has a separate drawing thread. Probably, with every tick, the internal sound data gets updated with the new version. However because the drawing of frames is independent, you have no sure way of knowing that no frames of sound have been dropped. If you were to put all the sound-data together, you'd most probably end up with a cut-up piece of music (unless you have a near-empty AVS preset, so that every frame of music is actually used).<br />
<br />
Note #2 to Montana: do you also insult people in public you don't know and call whatever they do crap? Gee, you'll get really far with that attitude. Please grow up and try to post only comments that will be interesting to *other* people than yourself.

		UNconeD: no i dont use assembly... i don't think in this case it would make much difference as the main use of CPU is on the call to the vfw32 api. i've written the packing loop pretty efficiently i think.<br />
<br />
if i compare RAW (32-bit) mode with 24-bit mode in my plugin, i estimate raw mode is around 20-30% faster. but raw mode is just making the API call and doing very little else! so i estimate the cost of packing every pixel in the frame using c++ at 15-25% of the cost of transferring a frame with the api. and  an assembly program could only hope to approach this improvement... unless i start rewriting vfw32.lib in assembly!!!<br />

		This is amazing!!!<br />
<br />
Tested versions of unconed and times2. <br />
<br />
Unconed:<br />
As you stated there's the 16-color-problem with the uncompressed mode. Compressed modes work fine but too slow since I need a higher-res to use it in my video-works. Nonetheless I might speed it up later in my video-software.<br />

times2:<br />
Uncompressed works perfect and fast enough. I do full vhs-video-res with pixeldoubling. I'm working with FAST-DV and Adobe-Premiere and the imported AVS-avis look sooo cool when blending them together with other video-tracks. Only bug to mention is a one-pixel-border at the bottom of the avi but this could be easily cut off in Premiere.<br />
<br />
Thank you both for this great work. Waited for such a thing a long time. Up to now I played out the Fullscreen-AVS to VHS-tape via an external VGA-TV-Converter and then recorded it to my DV-camcorder and then used my Fast-DV to get it back on PC. Quality was very good but it is a lot of work.

		thanks elvis...<br />
<br />
yeah i get that 1-pixel border too, do you get it with unconed's plugin?<br />
<br />
weird one that.<br />
<br />
what kind of vids are u making..?<br />
<br />
that computer&gt;&gt;vhs&gt;&gt;dv&gt;&gt;computer stuff is a pain, i tried stuff like that before and found the quality was never acceptable... it kinda goes fuzzy and also you get horizontal banding from lack of frame sync....

			<strong>AVSGrabber 1.1</strong><br />
		
		

		I released a new version of AVSGrabber.<br />
<br />
Bugfixes:<br />
 - The ugly 16-color-bug is now gone.<br />
 - The browse button would sometimes fail to work if you had already entered a filename.<br />
 - The status-field now works<br />
<br />
New:<br />
 - Added a 'raw' mode that rips ultra-fast. The slowdown is reduced to an absolute minimum, but the resulting AVI might not be compatible with every program.<br />
<br />
Get it from <a href="http://avs.acko.net/" target="_blank">http://avs.acko.net/</a><br />
Feedback is always welcome, either on this forum, the acko forum or by email.

		Now tested both grabbers (not the latest version of unconed) together with adobe-premiere:<br />
<br />
- It seems that pixeldoubling makes no sense since the grabbed AVI seems to have always the &quot;original&quot; res. Good results for video I got from a 400x300pix-window which is speedy enough on my system.<br />
<br />
- Some codecs/framerates worked not with premiere resulting in stocking or no playback at all or strange behaviour of the clip.<br />
<br />
- times2 grabber works allright with 25fps but drops a lot of frames and has got this pixels at the bottom of the avi. Also the uncompressed filesizes are giant. Reducing the framerate to avoid dropped frames worked not allright with premiere (strange behaviour) but perhaps I've got to change some settings on the clip in premiere to fix this.<br />
<br />
- Best results I got from unconeds grabber with Intel Indeo 3.2 codec at 25fps. Filesizes are cool, speed and quality were allright and the clip worked perfect with premiere. So I think this will be my fav so far.

I needed this tool very much, I dreamed about, and u were the first, although buggy. I used ur version 1 in a VJ production which I gonna show friday night. I put together some real kick ass video in premiere (very buggy under XP..) as intro for a theaterfestival. I used avi's and bmp's in avs and I could export on 512 x 384 on most vizs. (amd 1200 512mb raid 0 geforce gts2) I also took ur advice and used Virtual Dub (kewl app!) with wich I converted the buggy avi's to usable avi's. Also respect to UnConeD who also makes great presets.<br />

		OK, weird idea.  I only thought of this because Windows Media Encoder does the same thing.  If APE's can make calls to any arbitrary DLL, then this will work.<br />
<br />
As soon as you start reading frames with the APE, have it start a process in a DLL that captures the audio via the soundcard WaveIn feature.  This is analog and probably sounds like a cheap fix, but the advantage is that you could capture anything Winamp is playing if the correct recording source is selected (CD, WAV, MP3, MIDI...)<br />
<br />
The only problem here is latency involving WaveIn and the fact that the frame grabber will have to somehow get the recorded audio from the DLL once it becomes available.  Sounds like fun (you know, the kind of fun that usually happens after the frustration part).<br />
<br />
Another neat feature this could add is the use of ACM's to encode and compress audio data, or leave it PCM.

			<strong>apes, syncing</strong><br />
		
		

		.ape files go in the avs folder.<br />
<br />
syncing avis to music, i've had success here by putting in an effect that visibly reacts to sound- for instance a 'simple' oscilloscope- which will make a discernable pattern the instant you press 'play'. you then have a visible marker to place the beginning of your sound track to in premiere. (don't think virtualdub can do this). of course you may not want this effect at the beginning of your sequence. so you can either blank the beginning of the output movie (and turn off the osc as fast as possible) or else make up a version of your soundtrack with a dummy section at the BEGINNING.<br />

		Not all soundcards supports recording of its own output. Not to mention that's it's pretty silly to have it go through the card first. A DSP plugin provides you with first-class access, plus it integrates with Winamp. It's probably the best solution.

		Thanx UnConeD and Times2<br />
<br />
 I was sitting here, just wondering over the last few days how to do that avs-avi thingy and lo and behold two wonderful fluffy people up with a similar solution (I am reminded here of the Theory of Evolution and menes!!!), THANKYOU.<br />
 Basically I wanted it, as I use my own 3D animations through the avs as a live filter beat match unit/channel. But now I can grab these and slap them back onto the 3D objects, rerender the animations, put them back through the avs, and hey presto, even more fractal psychedelic imagery to help bend peoples heads at parties. Cheers again folks, and respect.<br />
 On a side I have had a few problems with playback speeds using avi's in the avs, and wondered if anyone else had any problems. I can get a reasonable frame rate with 320*240 stuff, which is alright for TV, but as I am starting to use data projectors at gigs (yes I am a VJ-sic sic sic) I wanted to take advantage of the higher resolution capacity. I have found even with 1+ Ghz computers with all the add-ons such as Matrox cards 512 ram and stuff, with any avi's higher than this (such as 640*480) the frame rate drops to an unacceptable level-5/6fps. Normally I need  15-20fps, similar to TV, as this is the &quot;speed&quot; at which it becomes possible to &quot;fool&quot; one's visual cortex, and also insert additional subliminal content. Has anyone had any greater success at finding perhaps the right combination? Or do I have to write an new avi player APE.<br />
  Lots of love, light, levity and a little liminality<br />
<br />
 P.s. I also am doing Free Video CD of my work, check out <a href="http://www.TranceVisuals.com" target="_blank">www.TranceVisuals.com</a> if you are interested, and send me an email and  I will post one out to you.

		The basic reply is &quot;It's AVS, AVS is slow, deal with it.&quot; :).<br />
<br />
If you search around the forum, you'll find numerous questions from people with shiny new systems wondering why AVS won't perform better on their system.<br />
<br />
Because it's 100% CPU based *and* performs way more complex stuff than your average 3D card, you won't get any resolution close to what most people expect these days. Nothing to do about it, other than learn how to simplify and optimize presets, so you squeeze out the most FPS.<br />
<br />
Perhaps upscaling a 400x300 picture can still lead to acceptable results?

		Diskwriter outputs as fast as it can, so you'd never get a synchronised audio-track. Plus I'm thinking about something that's easier to use and synchronises with my AVSGrabber automatically.<br />
I will try this in a week or two, but not now due to lack of time. Maybe times2 can try it with his.<br />
<br />
As far as your mario-kart thing is concerned, I doubt it'll work. The image is way too large and rendering it in AVS will reduce the resolution a lot. And if you want to do a convincing mario kart effect, you'll have to make a 3D planar projection along with a camera that follows and aligns itself to the track. Not so easy.

			<strong>sound</strong><br />
		
		

		montana: still coming across like a 12 year old!<br />
<br />
the reason I want to record sound is to be able to make a record of sound-reacting visuals. if I was to put some arbitrary sound on, the visuals wouldn't be reacting with the sound, would they? or what do you use AVS for? looking at your mommas holiday snaps?<br />
<br />
unconeD: I have been doing some experiments with both grabbers, would I be correct in saying that your plugin writes consecutive frames to the avi file without considering when they were grabbed? or how does your 'sync with avs' feature work? I've found that my plugin syncs better when the music is dubbed back on.<br />
<br />
I think to make an automatic grab-the-sound-as-well system, There needs to be a custom WINAMP plugin which is in communication with the .ape program. The problem is, what kind of plugin? If its an output plugin, I think you won't be able to hear the sound unless it also handles that itself..? Unless another class of plugin (general purpose?) can get access to the sound data? <br />
<br />
I know external programs can communicate with apes (as PPs visfrac does this) but I don't know how to go about this. And I won't have time to look into it for another week or so...<br />
<br />
For now I'm happy with the results I'm getting by putting in an effect that allows me to easily identify when the sound started and then dub it on afterwards.<br />
<br />
BTW: another tip for anyone who's doing this. If you're recording typical quarter-screen AVS movies (say 320x240 or 352x288) and then blowing them up for output to fullscreen video (either in software usinf virtualdub etc OR in hardware using your graphics cards fullscreen overlay) they look A LOT better if you save them uncompressed when small, and blow them up BEFORE compressing them with indeo, mpeg or divX etc. This is because compressed files store pixel data in YUV411, YUV420 or similar formats, effectively meaning that the resolution of the colour information is HALVED or QUARTERED. So you're better off blowing up first, otherwise the colour signal of your movie is effectively only 160x120 or less and you get very blurry edges on high-contrast coloured shapes.<br />
<br />
BTW another tip: mpeg4 v3 is by far the best quality codec in a given amount of data, that i've seen.<br />
<br />
PS UnconeD: hows the exams going?<br />

Hate to make this personal, but in another thread (AVS vs. Milkdrop) you found it necessary to talk about '3D shit' and 'u MD'ers' as well.<br />
Writing texts like that makes you look like a 12-year old.<br />
<br />
Most people who want to have an interesting discussion take the time to write out full sentences with correct grammar. And not 'talk shit lik dis 2 so they soundz wayy l33t'. It's got nothing to do with being snobby, but just simple communication skills. No-one is forcing you to change your typing habits, but don't complain if it affects someone else's view on you.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that your two last posts to this thread said exactly the same, aside from the comment on times2 observation. He also didn't say you were a 12-year old, he said you came across as a 12-year old.<br />
(/offtopic)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now on to the actual useful discussion. AVSGrabber doesn't drop frames... how exactly does your grabber achieve this? Does it have a separate AVI saving thread that runs alongside render() and just fetches the current data when it's done with an old frame? I didn't really bother since the AVI saver slows down your PC in general, so AVS as well. Does it make a difference?<br />
<br />
As far as 'Sync with AVS' is considered, I thought the UI was pretty clear on that though: It only applies to the playback rate (FPS)... if it's checked, the FPS will automatically be synchronized with AVS so you don't have to enter it manually.

seriously though. i'd be interested to know how well your 'previewed shit' syncs with the sound you've dubbed with the 'app i have'. because as far as i can tell, it couldn't.<br />
<br />
unconed: the way i'm saving the avi is, first i check if avs is onto a new frame (based on the framerate chosen). then i'm saving the new frame with the framenumber based on when it was grabbed, not just consecutively. so the frame displays at the right time, although its possible to drop frames if you choose too high a rate (which is how it should be)...<br />

Montana: Oh come on... typing <i>kewlz language that y'all be dissin' cos yer 2 kewl</i> has got to be harder than typing normally. Why not prove you have more language skills than a peanut and type like everyone else? Do you think that writing like that will make hollow comments and useless posts sound any more interesting? Of course, dropping the act would prove my point, and we'd all have a good laugh at your expense. Again, you don't have to change, as long as you'll just accept our comments on your rediculous language use, which you don't. You're acting like a 12-year old :)<br />

So you increase the value of the framecount (2nd parameter to AVIStreamWrite) so that it corresponds with the actual FPS rather than the set FPS? I didn't really <br />

If you take times2's grabber into account as well, that would be about 230 downloads.<br />
<br />
Ask those 230 people :)

		unconeD: was your mail trunctated?<br />
<br />
I invoke 'AVIStreamWrite' with the 'lStart' parameter set to the frame number that the frame should be played at rather than just numbering them sequentially. which is the only way to make it sync.<br />
<br />
<br />
montana: so your secret is to lower your standards until you've already met them! its obvious from your description that the nearest you could sync it would be the time it would take from you pressing 'play' in winamp to pressing 'save' in grabber.... as vdub cannot seperately trim inpoin ts on video vs. audio.... so i ask you again. did the movie you made looked synced?

		Yeah it was truncated, but you only missed the Montana-ized version of my reply ;) Don't know why... my internet connection was acting up yesterday.<br />
<br />
Will try the synching thing... my last exam is tomorrow so I'll have plenty of time for AVS'ing/APE'ing after that :)

		unconeD: update 4 sure, i'm getting good syncing with my saver as it is, (using 512x384@25fps with simple compositions) but i'd like to see [maybe by pooling talents] a saver that can save sound synced etc...<br />
<br />
my wishlist [when i get time... week after next]<br />
<br />
1) faster saving [direct binary transfer]<br />
2) sound as well<br />
3) start and stop when the song playback starts and stops?

		times2: yeah it looks synced, <br />
i play the song while grabbing the preset<br />
and then adding the song as a wave-file in vdub<br />
it works, do it yourself

			<strong>Awsome Job guys</strong><br />
		
		

		I came here looking for a way to convert avs to avi, and Times2 and the other guy were on top of it.  I just finished using both and they work perfect.  This kinda thing should have a price tag on it..

		Having *a bit* programming experience i thought up the following:<br />
<br />
Why don't you write a programm that uses a ape and a dsp plug to spy out the audio and video data? it should be synchron this way.<br />
Furthermore it should be able to record more than one avs-pre and even the transition as long as the spy.ape is included in the avs-pre's you use.:) would be great... :D

	<blockquote>
			
				(UnConeD) I've been thinking about coupling it with a DSP plug-in that captures synchronised audio. Haven't tried anything yet, but I'm going to do some more APE-stuff once I'm finished with my current exams :P</blockquote>
I don't think an APE can capture transitions though... when transitioning, AVS calculates each frame of both presets, and applies the transition filter afterwards. Because the APE's are both inside the presets, they will get a regular frame, not one with the transition filter.<br />
Also, each instance of an APE is a separate object. So when switching presets, all the data in the APE will be lost (like the handle to the AVI file) so the other APE in the next preset can't just continue on where the other left off. Sorry, but that's the way AVS works. The alternative would be a program that capture the AVS window externally. This would mean that the window has to be completely on top and it would make synching harder, but it would allow capturing of AVS transitions. Of course, this would require a totally different approach to AVSGrabber, which means a partial rewrite.

		[IDEA] How about recording the overlay signal??? on my pc, th overlay is recognized as a video stream and cn be sent to TV out without any performenc loss. it must be possible to record it! adding sound would be an easy task aferwards... [/IDEA]<br />
<br />
[DIFFENT TOPIC]anyway, have you tested <b>HOTLIST</b>??? it's my first released avs tool, have a look on it: <a href="http://www.home.pages.at/ptcle/Downloads/Hotlist.zip" target="_blank">Download</a>[/DIFFRENT TOPIC]

		today i used unconed's plugin to save my avs as avi. i wanted to compress the avi in virtualdub or nandub, but it turned out that both tools could not open the avi-stream. i tried other players than windows media players and also tried some alternative video editing tools. the avi created by the ape has no sound-channel, which is why most tools can't open the avi. wmp seems to ignore this, but i guess it's somehow against the avis specs. maybe it's possible to add a silent soundchannel to the avis, try implementing this in a future version of your ape.<br />
<br />
since i've seen your preview to whacko 4, i'm wondering what tool you used to compress your avis.

		I had the same problem... I created an AVI with AVSGrabber which played just great in Media Player, but when I opened it in VirtualDub I got a message &quot;Video data too short, expected nnnnnn bytes, got nnnnn bytes.&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Never found out what caused it, but after resetting my pc, the problem was fixed. In any case, it's not mine (or times2's) fault. Both APE's use Windows' standard AVI functions... it seems they contain a bug that can cause it to write corrupt AVI's sometimes :(. So sorry for the inconvenience, but it's not my fault.<br />
<br />
VirtualDub has its own AVI routines (which allow it to read partial or slightly corrupt AVI files) but which seems to choke on this bug.

		as mentioned above, it does. i only get a black video, unless i disable &quot;get fps from avs&quot;. you should also disable overlay, otherwise you might also get a black video. for the record: i use foobar 0.8.3 with avsmod 0.3 (that is avs 2.81 iirc).
