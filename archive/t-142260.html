<div class="posttext">Look there's nothing to be angry,evrybody improves with time. There was a time where i was'nt even able to understand what are rect.coordinates and polar coordinates!<br />
But now after spending time at the forums and learning from others i have improved quite a lot.<br />
Sorry if you felt insulted but i'll just say that try the atero's primer and the tips and tricks threads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Hmm, you hate AOL yet i see a certain similarity here between the chatrooms and this thread. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Not bad presets, the ideas are a little old but the good work is still there. Keep it up. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">BTW rock'N'roll to you is inpired by the kiss song god gave rock'N'roll to you II and live the fantasy is inspred by FF1(more speseficly the temple of chaos theme).<br />
<br />
p.s. I love that sphere movement (so I can atempt to imatate the cool effects) unfourtanatly I dident come up with it myself<br />
<br />
P.P.s. I &quot;HATED&quot; AOL (thats past tence) I've got broadband now and i have for some time. Oh and i never used the AOL chatrooms I'm somewhat antisociel(I hate interacting with people people they frighten me for some reason even though I dont care thats proaly why i dont post for loooong periods of time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Wow, you haven't been here in a bit.<br />
<br />
Anyway, These preset definately look more complete than the ones you made earlier. You might want to check out the tips and tricks threads for help with that math stuff. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I remember you!  Here's a test for the rest of you.  I know Jaheckelsafar will remember me, as well as some people who have been with AVS for quite a while.  <br />
<br />
How many of you giving ssj a hard time actually remember ME???  I know that plenty of forum members will remember me.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
ssj:<br />
<br />
Anyways, actually, I think people would think more highly of your presets if you didn't make stuff that &quot;cancels out&quot; the moving effect so much.  Think in terms of UnConeD's Aurora Borealis from Whacko AVS Pack 3.  Notice how the effect utilizes movement more completely.  I noticed that Source Map messed up one of your presets effect of movement.  First work in terms of default movements.  Try to get a fluid, moving effect that changes.  Roto Blitters with OnBeat reverse are helpful for that.<br />
<br />
You might try working on brightness effects, to get a nice effect that uses movements to produce a changing sorta glow around  your scopes.  I'll post some examples HOPEFULLY if the shop can recover the stuff from my laptop :(.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I remember the preset that you made your avatar out of, and remember your name, but I don't really remember you that much(just from when you were here in 2003).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">cmountford</div><div class="date small text-muted">8th August 2003, 04:51</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">yep, I remember you too, anubis.  :(  &lt;Hopes they can fix the laptop :(&gt;<br />
<br />
That thing has some of my best ever AVS work (unreleased!!!!)  Yay!  I bring new presets!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well Im sure you can do better just for to try avoid doing it wont help you get any better at it. AVS Tutorials (http://jerkoavs.5u.com/custom.html/) This may help. take a trig class at school. it will help you lots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I remember everyone in this thread.<br />
<br />
cmountford: You had those two huge threads, one learning from nic01 and one about LOTR presets. I remember interjecting about acos(-1) not being a pretty good approximation for pi but being as close to the real thing as avs can handle.<br />
<br />
ssj2gohan1018: All i can remember about you is that you are a n00b. No offense, but its true. I remember your name and avatar though, and that you weren't nearly half as bad a n00b as Xion, who appears to have left forever (please god make him never return).</div></div><hr />
