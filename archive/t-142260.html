      <br />
      Anyway, These preset definately look more complete than the ones you made earlier. You might want to check out the tips and tricks threads for help with that math stuff. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I remember you! Here's a test for the rest of you. I know Jaheckelsafar will remember me, as well as some people who have been with AVS for quite a while.<br />
      <br />
      How many of you giving ssj a hard time actually remember ME??? I know that plenty of forum members will remember me.<br />
      <br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

      Anyways, actually, I think people would think more highly of your presets if you didn't make stuff that "cancels out" the moving effect so much. Think in terms of UnConeD's Aurora Borealis from Whacko AVS Pack 3. Notice how the effect utilizes movement more completely. I noticed that Source Map messed up one of your presets effect of movement. First work in terms of default movements. Try to get a fluid, moving effect that changes. Roto Blitters with OnBeat reverse are helpful for that.<br />
      <br />
      You might try working on brightness effects, to get a nice effect that uses movements to produce a changing sorta glow around your scopes. I'll post some examples HOPEFULLY if the shop can recover the stuff from my laptop :(.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I remember everyone in this thread.<br />
      <br />
      cmountford: You had those two huge threads, one learning from nic01 and one about LOTR presets. I remember interjecting about acos(-1) not being a pretty good approximation for pi but being as close to the real thing as avs can handle.<br />
      <br />
      ssj2gohan1018: All i can remember about you is that you are a n00b. No offense, but its true. I remember your name and avatar though, and that you weren't nearly half as bad a n00b as Xion, who appears to have left forever (please god make him never return).</p>
