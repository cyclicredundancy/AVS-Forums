			<strong>3D Studio MAX &amp; AVS</strong><br />
		
		

		I have downloaded 3D.ape not too long ago. I know it needs 3D objects to run. The ones that 3D MAX and other progs create. I also have 3D Studio MAX R4 (This expensive software I purchased on a Ukrainian market for 2 dollars. Full wersion too. How lucky I am!:D). It's been my favourite program for many years but I had no idea it could be used in AVS. A vague explanation is all I found in the forums :( .<br />
<br />
If someone knows how to do it, please explain:D (to what format to convert *.max files and with what). Thanks.

		I got it all figured out. Just have to use the export function in MAX and export as a .asc file. Though I was rather dissapointed that 3D.ape did nothing but rotate the object and change it's color. :( My ideal seing of this ape is that it should at least have a color selector (16 colors) and something to control the rotation of the object and zoom. (not speaking of the ability to control the movement and rotation of the pivot point of the object by a formula :cry: ). The disappearence of the polygons when one of the vertexes goes behind the screen is a minus too. But oh well...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if 3d.ape supports any other object formats?
