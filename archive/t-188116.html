<div class="posttext">Hey guys!.<br />
This is my 1st preset.<br />
Basically i know neither head or tail of how 2 make a superscope.this is the best i could manage.Pls post ur opinions.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">varun_mark</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th August 2004, 19:03</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">ok.my 1st one was very bad.<br />

i believe this one is better.<br />
hope all of you agree!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Not bad for first presets. Try to learn what the code does in default code, but don't use it in finished presets. It's meant as a beginners guide. It's better than a lot of first presets i've seen though, keep at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">thanks.i've been through most of the threads that explain coding,but most of the stuff bounced right over my head.i know basics of trigonometry,though.<br />
wish i could get some more help.:hang:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">blaz</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st August 2004, 08:48</div></div>

<div class="posttext">well, the second AVs is nice :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Just don't expect to know it all straight away. Work at your own pace and just keep making stuff as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">varun_mark</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th August 2004, 07:31</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Thanks.<br />
Raz you said that i should not use default codes in my presets.would it be fine if i use the render/simple option?<br />
i have tried it and i think it looks ok<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">See, one of the main problems we AVSers have with the built in effects is that theu are not very configurable and are the staple of everybody's first presets, 'cause they don't know better. Now while it may be possible to make &quot;cool&quot; looking things with the built in things, all the effects made by them can be reproduced using things like the superscope and the dynamic movmement, once you learn how to code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Another thing;<br />
whenever my preset uses too many effects,it tends to become really slow and looks pretty clumsy.<br />
What can one do to make them faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Mr_Nudge</div><div class="date small text-muted">30th August 2004, 12:59</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">make sure you only have what you actually need in your presets, i know it sounds a little silly, but thats sometimes the case with slow presets. Just see how many things you can delete before it stops looking like it should. Also, coded effects are much faster than pre-built effects and offer much more flexibility, so learn to code, it's not that hard once you know what everything does, just experiment!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Someone please have a look at this one. <br />
i can't control it's speed of rotation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Digital Chaos</div><div class="date small text-muted">5th September 2004, 17:28</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Do you want to slow it down, speed it up, change directions on beat, all of the above ? Be more specific on how you want to control it.<br />
The main variable that is controlling your rotation is 'dr' in the trans / dynamic movement. The rotation comes from the fact that you are adding +0.002 to 'dr' every frame.<br />
If you just want to slow it down, in the Pixel text box replace the code with:<br />
Per Pixel:<br />
d=cos(d/pow(dr, 2)) ; r=abs(r - 0.5*dr);<br />
<br />
And in the beat text box:<br />
Per Beat:<br />
dr = dr - 0.8<br />
<br />
And for each frame:<br />
Per Frame:<br />
dr = dr + 0.02<br />
<br />
Umm... I hope I helped out, man.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks.<br />
I used the stuff in these. hope they're ok.<br />
Can't bet on what those things are first 15 seconds or so:) .<br />

<div class="posttext">while the interactive superscope was slightly interesting it doesn't make up for the lack of creativity. try doing a little more experimenting</div></div><hr />
