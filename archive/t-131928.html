      <p class="post-content">the point was that texering WILL do it if you do it right, not saying that you did it.<br />

      this is an extremely pointless thread imho...i agree with raz, don't post crap like this :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">it obviously seemed obvious that this preset is made in AVS, But I softened it a bit using JPEG editor :D, though i could have used a simple two blur effect...:D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks crappy in the avs editor window. Looks bent. Make the edges more defined because it looks like it's bending instead of moving around. Make it thicker. When it comes into focus good it looks great though. Just put a bit more work into it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That was my original point. And don't whinge that UnConeD didn't get critisised because he did (i think). UnConeD has made too many good presets and APE's to remain critisised though. Lets just drop it and continue on.</p>
