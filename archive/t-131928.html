<div class="posttext">it's really not that hard, it's just a ring.  specular lighting and a little texering will do this in a flash...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its possible but you can also do it with a DM...Torus kinda hard but you can do it.Search for UnConeD`s LOTR preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">saying &quot;i won't say anything&quot; is saying something :p will you hurry up and show us your preset already, the suspense is killing me ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the point was that texering WILL do it if you do it right, not saying that you did it.<br />
<br />
this is an extremely pointless thread imho...i agree with raz, don't post crap like this :hang:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">it obviously seemed obvious that this preset is made in AVS, But I softened it a bit using JPEG editor :D, though i could have used a simple two blur effect...:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Looks crappy in the avs editor window. Looks bent. Make the edges more defined because it looks like it's bending instead of moving around. Make it thicker. When it comes into focus good it looks great though. Just put a bit more work into it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">This thread was pointless, IMO.  You could have just started it like a normal person and posted your preset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That was my original point. And don't whinge that UnConeD didn't get critisised because he did (i think). UnConeD has made too many good presets and APE's to remain critisised though. Lets just drop it and continue on.</div></div><hr />
