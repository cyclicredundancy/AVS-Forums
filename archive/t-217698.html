<div class="posttext">The 'Alpha Blending' box in the AVS Editor 'Display settings' greyed out. I am on XP Pro. I have Alpha blending enabled in modern skin support, though I'm quite sure it has nothing to do with this, except that something in the program recognizes alpha blending capabilities. I dont think this is unimplemented. I noticed someone else saying it worked ok for them. I'm sure its not that big of a deal, just annoying.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any productive ideas on this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">you might have your resolution set on 24 bit because 32 bit is virtually 24 million colour + 8 bit alpha</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply. I havent seen a 24 bit option in windows display properties since about 1999. I dont know if they took it out after win 98, or if my newer graphics card didnt implement that bit depth. Around that time I bought a new system, and installed win XP. I only run in 32 bit color. In fact most newer graphic cards are so optimized for 32 bit, that if you look at many benchmarks you will see they actually run worse in 16 bit :confused:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">AVS-wise runs 32 bit faster than 24 or 16bit. <br />
It sounds strange, but AVS is rendered in 32bit anyway. <br />
To show this in either 24 or 16bit, it needs to be converted first and that takes time (and thus framerate).<br />
<br />
Did this 24-bit thing solve the issue though? I can hardly imagine that it would..<br />
I really don't have a clue on what it could be otherwise though.. <br />
I'd recommend a (clean) Winamp re-install, but since I don't know where the problem is (could be your graphics card too) I can't promise that it would solve it.. It's worth a try of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">there is no 24 bit thing, I have only had 16 &amp; 32 bit for color settings since around 1999. I have run 32 bit ever since. <br />
<br />
Will try a clean install now. BRB :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">nope, clean install, even removed folder,and ALL registry entries. Configured nothing, just started it like it comes out of the box. started AVS, and went to look at options. Stille greyed out. I would want to say something about vid card drivers or what not, but I read AVS only uses CPU, so...</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I have this same problem under XP Pro. But the alpha blending works fine under 2k on the same system. Will test 2k3 later.<br />
<br />
The alpha blending works fine if applied to whole winamp skin though... it alpha blends the avs with the player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'm talking about AVS&gt;AVS Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Display&gt;Alpha Blending Box<br />
<br />
Not the Modern Skin Alpha Blending, which I have enabled, and have no problem with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">He just said, that the modern skin alpha blending also blends the avs window (usually). So if you want your avs window to be alpha blended, you should try this out!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I see. So what does this setting do?<br />
<br />
AVS&gt;AVS Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Display&gt;Alpha Blending Box</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey mine is disabled and I'm running xp, obviously not supposed to touch it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">^..^</div><div class="date small text-muted">3rd June 2005, 10:29</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well, at least it has nothing to do with winXP i guess, cause im running it and that box is not greyed out here.<br />
<br />
what that box does? well i would say it can alpha-blend the avs window irrespective of the main window, playlist.. state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">i guess alpha blending is controlled by winamp if avs is docked to a modern skin player. would make sense since it'd look stupid otherwise ^^</div></div><hr />
