<div class="posttext">This is my latest pack. i decide to go for a mini pack this time based on Neon presets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">eheiney</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2006, 06:58</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Testing? Okay, uh... well, it works. :p<br />
<br />
Oh, did you want some constructive criticism? Well this actually isn't all that bad, but it's still needs a bit of work.<br />
<br />
- Galaxy:<br />
First and foremost this needs to be slowed down, it's moving around too quickly to even try to enjoy. If you've figured out how to incorporate fps independency, please do this. If you haven't, try lowering the values of your constants.<br />
<br />
Next, even if this is slowed down, the movements are very predictable. Try adding in some on-beat variables to change it up a bit. The Custom BPM doesn't do much either, I would trash this. I would also trash the blur. I'd say either give this a heavier blur or zoom in on the galaxy a bit.<br />
<br />
- Neonics:<br />
This one I am least fond of. I like the alpha blending but I wish there more of it, perhaps something a bit more dynamic as well. I think the colours could also use some work, additive blending is fine but when it turns white it just looks like shit.<br />
<br />
- Orgasmic Reality:<br />
Much better! The colours are very nice and the bump really sets it off. It could use some more blending and, along with the rest, some more random movement. Is this the same coding, by the way? The bitmaps may be different but the object looks exactly the same as the previous preset.<br />
<br />
- Tentacles Of Light:<br />
There's not much else to say about this that's any different from the others. It could be slowed down a bit and it could use some more dynamic movements. Beyond that, it's not too bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
While it's convenient to use other people's work, I'd like to see some of your own. It's a bit confusing to me when you say &quot;all code is mine except the 3d engine which belongs to...&quot;. What do you consider the 3d engine?<br />
<br />
Overall it's pretty decent. But I think it would be really nice if you could fix a few of these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Like denkie here said, learn how to make your presets fps independent (in other words, speed changes according to framerate). Galaxy is just moving way too fast even with my bad excuse for a computer.<br />
<br />
Otherwise this minipack just looks like a experiment of sorts with 3D scoping, not much to it as the effect work is quite minimal. Also the scopes are quite random and most people consider that as boring or bad coding and don't care for it so.<br />
<br />
Try to evolve in both aspects and code at the same time, otherwise you'll find yourself being good at only one thing and that can limit your possibilities quite a lot. I've seen it too many times before, only coders do not so great looking presets and aesthethic masters don't know how to make their visions a reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">good ideas, my favourite is orgasmic realities.. but they all look unfinished. too many plain backgrounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</div><div class="date small text-muted">20th September 2006, 21:46</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">well i'm still learning. bye the way Tuggummi i'm surprised you didn't say anything about the Orgasmin Reality preset after all the dyna move work except the dyna with the single alpha is all yours from some preset i can't remeber its name. anyway thanks for the suggestions i'll post the latest version as soon as i make the changes.<br />
<br />
also thanks for the help i really enjoy having all this help on my presets.<br />
<br />
with your permission Tuggummi i would like to continue using the codes in Orgasmic Reality if you don't mind me doing so.<br />
<br />
oh and remixes of my work will be included in the pack if you would like to fix my ugly coding.<br />
<br />
p.s. in the Tentacles of Light preset the d=atan(log blah blah thing was a random adding and changing and eventualy i came up with the shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Tuggummi</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st September 2006, 01:17</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">If i didn't notice then it's probably okay for you to continue, because if i don't notice something it's most likely nothing important or advanced :o<br />
<br />
Just note me if you're using stuff from my latest 3 packs or so, those i care about the most imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Here about this. changed some stuff that you might like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">It's better. One question concerning Galaxy and Tentacles Of Light, are you able to sync the galaxy and the starfield, and the object and the &quot;wall&quot;, respectively?<br />
<br />
Neonics looks much better and Orgasmic Reality looks really good actually. It could still stand to be slowed down just a bit, but besides that it looks very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</div><div class="date small text-muted">22nd September 2006, 23:22</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">maybe putting the galaxy and stars on seperate 3d engines was a bad idea. i'll return them to the synced global var one that i normally use. as for the rest of them thanks for the creds. i'm still learning as it shows obviously. but what i would like to learn how to do is make solid 3d models instead of these line arts. i mean no disrespect to the old sine wave models that i've made but i would like to better my studies in 3d. anyway i do want to know what your opinions on the new dynamove in neonics is like. also the color map was the only way i could make it neony enough. without losing to much framrate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</div><div class="date small text-muted">25th September 2006, 23:08</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I completely redid Neonics and made Orgasmic Realitys more interesting.<br />
but Tentacles Of Light in my opinion might get kicked off the pack. let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</div><div class="date small text-muted">29th September 2006, 00:17</div></div>

<div class="posttext">add this to the Mini its to replace Tentacles Of Light.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Alright i'm finished working on this pack. all are free to give remixes anything is acceptable. and thanks for the help you guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Related to the 1st attachment: imo the beat detection and music reaction in Tentacles of Light, Orgasmic reality and especially Galaxy is quite good. I have tested them on many songs and they showed good results, even on fast coaster-like music. Neonics in test wasn't responding good, but it is a good preset anyway cause it is complicated, and I use to like complicated presets. If I will have time I will test the last changes soon.</div></div><hr />

They both need pimping. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">I made a tut and another preset. tell me what you think.<br />
<br />
do me one fav. if any of you know any optimisations for the DM in Magic compass please tell me what i can do about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">jheriko</div><div class="date small text-muted">15th November 2006, 15:56</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I would dl the preset and test, but the obvious candidate is the DM grid size (that and I am at work). Lower grid size = faster preset = higher framerate.<br />
<br />
(x_gridsize_of_DM)(y_gridsize_of_DM) ~= m / (preset_framerate - n)<br />
<br />
for some suitable m and n<br />
<br />
Also note that if the DM does a linear coordinate transform of some kind then using a 0x0 or 1x1 gridsize (they both do the same thing) will produce the exact effect required. Rotations are linear. When i say 'linear' i mean that for a transformation matrix all the components are linear when we represent the transform as a matrix and our coords as vectors<br />
i.e.<br />
<br />
(a b c)(x) (x')<br />
(d e f)(y)=(y')<br />
(g h i)(z) (z')<br />
<br />
<br />
where none of the a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h or i contain terms in x,y,z or any f(x),f(y),f(z)<br />
<br />
This includes scaling, shearing, reflections about the origin, rotations about the origin, orthogonal projections and some other transforms too weird and wonderful to bother mentioning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I thought when you shift a rotation from the origin it ruins a DM... though thinking about it, there is no reason why that should break a linear interpolation... need to test when I get home.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Originally posted by jheriko <br />
I thought when you shift a rotation from the origin it ruins a DM.  This would be contradictory to your previous supposition since you can express the transformation as the matrix multiplication of the rotation matrix and the translation matrix giving you a linear transformation matrix of the form presented in your post.<br />
<br />
<br />
(cosÎ¸ -sinÎ¸ 0)(1 0 Tx)(X)<br />
(sinÎ¸ cosÎ¸  0)(0 1 Ty)(Y)<br />
( 0     0   1)(0 0  1)(1)<br />
<br />
becomes...<br />
<br />
(cosÎ¸ -sinÎ¸ cosÎ¸.Tx-sinÎ¸.Ty)(X)<br />
(sinÎ¸ cosÎ¸  sinÎ¸.Tx+cosÎ¸.Ty)(Y)<br />
( 0     0           1      )(1)<br />
<br />
assming my multiplication is correct (Using homogeneous coordinates and ignoring z because we dont have one). This applies (obviously?) for n composed linear transformations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">wrap seems to break the &quot;DM affine transformation theorem&quot; dunno why... it should just be doing min(max(x,-1),1); before texture sampling</div></div><hr />

thanks for assists you guys. i'll look into the code. maybe i can find a better tunnel engine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">all right i made one more compilation of presets.<br />
I;ve modded Neonics somewhat and brought out some oldies of mine and added a new one called Analysis box. took me sometime before i was contempt with it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">First of all, I would like to say that this mini pack has a bit improvements from the colours (what I can see). Black background is still..:) btw, I like Neonics.<br />
<br />
Galaxy is good if you didn't make the stars blinking. It really hurts my eyes ;)<br />
oh yeah, I do something for that galaxy..</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Yay i now have a idea of what to do. and Javs thanks for the remix, i'll include it in the pack. I was wondering would the drawing of the lines be made easier by making a cube out of multiple sscs or would one be sufficient?<br />
anywho i love the help guys. i'll put the theory to work,*once i learn how to utilize buffers &gt;_&lt;* *<br />
ack my head already hurts.<br />
anyway thanks heaps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I've changed the starfields in both Galaxy and Mobius Strip.<br />
also i added a XOR based backround for Analysis Box.<br />
Javs sorry but the galaxys flashing has to stay i like the on-spec changes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I found a way to make the galaxy flash but not to fast. *thx to sheryas_potnis for making waveforms*<br />
<br />
anywho i changed the color or the galaxy to be sensitiv to the music.<br />
also i added some buffering to neonics that i learned from Javs. also i changed the backround of Analysis box.</div></div><hr />
