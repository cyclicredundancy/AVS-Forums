<div class="posttext">Post your Articles, Tips &amp; Tricks and whatever you like to see on the AVS Site here. You can also include files if you like. No crap please. For talking about this go to the website thread.<br />
<br />
It would also be :up: if someone would collect some usefull forum links (to knowledge threads like the faq and so on) with a small description.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] OOps! Somehow my keyboard just fucked up as i wrote the thread subject. Mod-&gt; correct it please</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">:winamp: 1)     Have a section devoted to APE development and distribution.<br />
<br />
:winamp: 2)     Bing the AVS website up in segments so we (the people) can start contributing to the appropriate sections. (Start with the APE section of the site) :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">/sigh.  Did you read the original thread about this: http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=133455.<br />
<br />
There is going to be a section about APEs.  That was already covered.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, we have to find a host and pull together the resources to get it up and running.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PotW - Preset of the Week, Day if AVS get that popular.<br />
Weekly Review - A long, extremely detailed review of a pack. Extremely brutal, requests allowed - just note the &quot;extremely brutal&quot; part...<br />
Yearly Pack - Best of AVS presets of the year ____<br />
Featured Artist - Monthly? Not featuring pros, but rather newcomers that show the most promise.<br />
<br />
I don't need all those coming in all at once - just one by one is fine.<br />
<br />
I also believe that each tricks should be individualized as pages (and the titles as topics - Optimizations, Aesthetics, SSC, Dynamic transes, APE coding, etc) so that there's no rummaging around just for one trick.<br />
<br />
I'm also willing to do some of these... least I can do to help :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Featured artist sounds cool... ooh ooh... can I be a featured artist :P<br />
ehhh well.<br />
How bout a, DM library, where less skilled Coders can pull and share code from,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">13th May 2003, 02:43</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">I don't think that will be a good idea ches.  Many won't give any credit to the original creators and then we will just see a lot more of the same presets - there are enough already.  What we need are just tutorials ranging from the easiest to the hardest topics.  I wouldn't mind helping.  Basically, we just need to go through these forums and find useful threads that talk about useful things, give links to them, and then explain the things in them even more in depth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">collect all of unconeds posts in the forums and then sort it out and include in the site<br />
<br />
i am talking about the explaination posts</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Actually i planned the following sections (mostly a knowledge Base, things like Nic's idea can be added later):<br />
<br />
General Information &amp; Faq<br />
-what is AVS<br />
-Troubles -&gt; Solutions<br />
-Settings in AVS<br />
-etc<br />
<br />
Component description<br />
-about all the standard components in AVS<br />
<br />
Coding<br />
-basic and advanced coding for Movements, DM's, SSC's, Bump and whatever is codeable<br />
<br />
APE's :D<br />
-Collection of all APE's with XXL onefile documentation<br />
-APE Programming (basic &amp; advanced)<br />
<br />
Do we need anything more? I think thats fairly enough for a startup.<br />
<br />
So get your Articles in here :)<br />
<br />
(i know, a lot can be taken out of primer but anyway)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">this is a text file i made just then containing all of the useful posts in the tips and tricks thread. It needs sorting through to get what is for superscopes, what is for dms and what is just random shite.<br />
I havnt listed the usernames of each post cause it would have taken ages. so i hope noone cares.<br />
If someone actually finishes at least a template of the website, ill be more willing to produce some more accesable content!<br />
<br />
&quot;all in all its just one more brick in the wall&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">That's nice siddhartha, but I think some of them should be edited/taken out.<br />
<br />
I am going to start working on an in-depth tutorial to basic superscope things, and will upload it when done</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Because Atero's leaves a lot out with SSC's - I don't think his new one is going to get everything either.  I've already started working on mine and I'm going to try to put a whole lot of information in it.  After I finish the first couple of lessons I'll upload them to see what you all think about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">Magic.X</div><div class="date small text-muted">16th May 2003, 13:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Best would be to try it out - so next newbie who comes here has to test it ;)<br />
<br />
A VJ sektion would also be nice. I'll take care of that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">the primer is designed to show people how effects work, and the very basics of common effects.  the resource pack may include more info on ssc's, but i haven't gotten that far yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">fair enough.. what do you want ppl to do now? that isnt already half done by others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">anubis2003</div><div class="date small text-muted">17th May 2003, 21:27</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">Finish the other half.  Even redoing something that has already been done can be helpful - it's good to have different approaches to the same problem so that more people can figure it out.</div></div><hr />
