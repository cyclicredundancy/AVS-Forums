      Post your Articles, Tips &amp; Tricks and whatever you like to see on the AVS Site here. You can also include files if you like. No crap please. For talking about this go to the website thread.<br />
      <br />
      It would also be :up: if someone would collect some usefull forum links (to knowledge threads like the faq and so on) with a small description.<br />
      <br />
      [EDIT] OOps! Somehow my keyboard just fucked up as i wrote the thread subject. Mod-&gt; correct it please</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>2 suggestions &gt; 2 great ideas</strong><br />
      :winamp: 1) Have a section devoted to APE development and distribution.<br />
      <br />
      :winamp: 2) Bing the AVS website up in segments so we (the people) can start contributing to the appropriate sections. (Start with the APE section of the site) :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">/sigh. Did you read the original thread about this: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=133455." target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....readid=133455.</a><br />
      <br />
      There is going to be a section about APEs. That was already covered.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, we have to find a host and pull together the resources to get it up and running.</p>

      <p class="post-content">PotW - Preset of the Week, Day if AVS get <i>that</i> popular.<br />
      Weekly Review - A long, extremely detailed review of a pack. Extremely brutal, requests allowed - just note the "extremely brutal" part...<br />
      Yearly Pack - Best of AVS presets of the year ____<br />
      Featured Artist - Monthly? Not featuring pros, but rather newcomers that show the most promise.<br />
      <br />
      I don't need all those coming in all at once - just one by one is fine.<br />
      <br />
      I also believe that each tricks should be individualized as pages (and the titles as topics - Optimizations, Aesthetics, SSC, Dynamic transes, APE coding, etc) so that there's no rummaging around just for one trick.<br />
      <br />
      I'm also willing to do some of these... least I can do to help :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think that will be a good idea ches. Many won't give any credit to the original creators and then we will just see a lot more of the same presets - there are enough already. What we need are just tutorials ranging from the easiest to the hardest topics. I wouldn't mind helping. Basically, we just need to go through these forums and find useful threads that talk about useful things, give links to them, and then explain the things in them even more in depth.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually i planned the following sections (mostly a knowledge Base, things like Nic's idea can be added later):<br />
      <br />
      General Information &amp; Faq<br />
      -what is AVS<br />
      -Troubles -&gt; Solutions<br />
      -Settings in AVS<br />
      -etc<br />
      <br />
      Component description<br />
      -about all the standard components in AVS<br />
      <br />
      Coding<br />
      -basic and advanced coding for Movements, DM's, SSC's, Bump and whatever is codeable<br />
      <br />
      APE's :D<br />
      -Collection of all APE's with XXL onefile documentation<br />
      -APE Programming (basic &amp; advanced)<br />
      <br />
      Do we need anything more? I think thats fairly enough for a startup.<br />
      <br />
      So get your Articles in here :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">this is a text file i made just then containing all of the <b>useful</b> posts in the tips and tricks thread. It needs sorting through to get what is for superscopes, what is for dms and what is just random shite.<br />
      I havnt listed the usernames of each post cause it would have taken ages. so i hope noone cares.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Because Atero's leaves a lot out with SSC's - I don't think his new one is going to get everything either. I've already started working on mine and I'm going to try to put a whole lot of information in it. After I finish the first couple of lessons I'll upload them to see what you all think about them.</p>
