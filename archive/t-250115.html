			<strong>Help finding an old avs</strong><br />
		
		

		Hi Guys!  I was looking through the avs archives and I can't find an old visualization that I loved.  It was really simple, it just had one or two circles that just went around and around each other like a hula-hoop effect.  I can't even remember if it changed colors but it started out hot pink.  This one disapeared on me when Winamp updated to the modern look a few years back.  Does anybody remember this one or know where to look?  Thanks so much!<br />
Beth
