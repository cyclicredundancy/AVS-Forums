		Is it just me or are some people not getting the exposure they want? Unless your plugin or pack is absolutely magically supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (sorry, pulled a Mary Poppins there), isn't the 'new plugins' section enough? It takes a while for any submission to get reviewed, but if it's good, it'll get to the top eventually. Why don't you start checking out other plugins and reviewing them... someone else might do it for yours as well :)<br />
<br />
Anyway that's my rant-o'-the-something.<br />
<br />
<br />
(And in good WinAMP-forums tradition I must advise you to check out <a href="http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=78028" target="_blank">Whacko AVS</a>. Llama-whacking good if I may say so.)

		It's SUPERB, but I like No.1 more (it's probably THE BEST :D pack I've ever seen :D). One question, how do you do such great DM's :D.

			<strong>Hey..</strong><br />
		
		

		I posted in another thread I saw you post in, but anyways here's the gist of it:<br />
<br />
 Your mastery of the superscope astounds me.<br />
 Your packs are simply sublime.<br />
 Thank you for your work.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I'm still learning, but your packs really blew my mind. When I statedlooking at the superscopes creating the word &quot;unconed&quot; on your promo preset in the first pack, I was dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
 Simply wonderfull..

		It is the best I have seen in my entire life! It's so original! And I do hate stuff that looks like it is randomly thrown together. This is not that stuff. This is a work of art. You're even better than that justin guy.

		UnConeD. What's your first pack's id no.? I had it a while ago. But I lost it when I built my new comp. I'd love to have it again, it blew my mind<a href="http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/smilies/grin.gif" target="_blank">http://www.mear.fsnet.co.uk/smilies/grin.gif</a>!

		i don't know what else can i say and avoid repeating what guys above siad already.<br />
but i really belive these 2 packs are the best ...<br />
recreating core demo scene fx in avs was a premium idea ...<br />
<br />
hope to see some more soon!<br />
