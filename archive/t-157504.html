<div class="posttext">Any of you think you can make a preset that has a face that can appear to be singing? I know some of you are really good at this stuff and can make ships flying around and junk so I thought I'd throw this idea out there to give you a challenge. It would be cool to see something like that and I don't think it's ever been done before. I'm guessing the jaw would have to react only to certain frequencies in order to make sure it's not singing in a guitar solo, lol. I don't think it's possible to make it work perfectly but you can probably get it close enough to look cool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Its impossible for single track music data, because you have to allow for a huge range of vocal tones. And this range will inevitable overlap with guitar, snare, cymbols, brass etc. <br />
<br />
Also, attempting to distinguish different vowel sounds, so as to make it actually look like it is singing, not just moving its mouth around, would require a much more complicated language than avs scripting offers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I always did wonder would there be a way to separate certain instruments, vocals or whatnot so a getspec or getosc would only detect the i.e. drums. or as in this case, the vocals.<br />
<br />
The face is totally possible, with 2D you could make your own face sing easily with just a few dm's. Tho in 3D it's a whole different story, it would probably be quite slow before it would look even half-decent im guessing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Common music is a flood of frequencies. Our brain is a massive neural network trained from birth to recognize sounds. Recreating that in software is very hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Not to mention the problems with nonconventional music, especially of the more strange electronic kind. It would detect the frequencies as vocals.<br />
<br />
I always wondered if maybe it was possible to make music dvd's that have all the different instruments on different tracks. One song will consist of for example 16 tracks of music playing at the same time. You can set the volume for each of those tracks. You could then customize your music; no drums or no vocals. I think it should be possible to fit an hour of 16-track music with compression like .shn on a dvd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">actually, there was a fad about 3 years ago, where some radio station had the idea  to transmit each song in 4 different tracks. Each song had its preset mixing and mastering default, but you could change it how you like... so long as you had the right receiver :)<br />
<br />
Im sure it fell through because it was too big an addaption for most people, not to mention the cost on the radostation of getting track rights to al the songs they wanted to play. Its practically allowing any old fucker to come along and make a remix.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">That reminds me of a CD set the Flaming Lips put out where you had to play 4 CD's at one time to get the full effect.  It's called Zaireeka.</div></div><hr />
