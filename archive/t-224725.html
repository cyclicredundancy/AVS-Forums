			<strong>AVS file isn't recognized...</strong><br />
		
		

		I have a preset I made a few weeks ago, and for some reason it is just seen as a &quot;file&quot; now (as opposed to an AVS file). It won't open in AVS, and it does not give me the option to change what program opens it. If I just try to &quot;open&quot; it, Winamp is the only program I can choose to open it which does me no good because it opens it in the player. (In other words, I can't choose to open a file with AVS, because AVS doesn't appear in the drop down list.) It was a decent preset, and I hope there is a simple solution...however I am at a loss. Please help me out?:(

		As far as I know, it was never possible to open AVS files that way. I might be wrong, though...<br />
<br />
You can load an AVS file with &quot;Preset / Load&quot; in the AVS editor menu. That will work.<br />
<br />
Or, better yet, you can move the file into your &quot;WinAmp/Plugins/avs&quot; directory where it'll be accessible through the pull-down menu, and also the &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Prev&quot; and &quot;Random&quot; buttons.

		Ah yes, how simple is that? I forgot about being able to switch to &quot;all files&quot; (instead of just AVS). Duur. Thank you much stevenroy.:)
