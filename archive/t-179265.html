      <p class="post-content">Welcome to WA. And if you thought signing up to the forum was a horror, try submitting your pack here at WA.com :igor:<br />
      <br />
      [edit] oops I see you already have... you got luckier than I got. I've tried it 3 times, now I've lost all hope and set up my own website (about a year ago).<br />

      <p class="post-content">While were on that subject: does anyone find it strange that I tried to publish on of my packs on here(a while ago), and after publishing it. My account used for publishing plugins disappeared. I didn't recieve and e-mail or anything. And now, if you search for hungryskull on the plugins search, my pack comes up, and I can access every thing I should be able to.</p>

      </blockquote>That happend to me too, but the weirdest thing is. I got a letter from wa saying that my pack has been published, when i searched for it, it even came up.. but the next day it wasn't there anymore and i got another e-mail from wa saying that the installer is broken, when i even downloaded it and it worked.<br />
      Now, that is strange. ...all this happend 2 year's ago :down: i would've been more popular that way if i'd gotten my pack published then. :(

      <p class="post-content">Well i had nothing like this when my pack was publish. I've just deleted it soon, cause i have not got a good installer. But anyways, congratulations for the official release, acid ;)</p>
