      <p class="post-content"><strong>PJ - Pack II</strong><br />
      I've taken everyone suggestion about newcomers posting packs, and posted it here first. This Is PJ - Pack II. It's probably the biggest pack that i've seen that isn't totally noobish, but im biased. If some people could comment, post remixes, dowload, I would be very happy. Some Constructive Critisim Please. My third pack is almost finshed, It doesn't take me long to make presets. ( my first pack was made in one afternoon ).<br />
      Anyway, I hope you like It, But if you don't tell me ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">err if it were me... I'd separate categorize, don't multiply certain objects(ssc) stop using multi filter (im sure theres a real way to chrome something?) and try the fadeout effect it works much better, use some renders modes(they can do wonders)</p>

      <p class="post-content">WOtl, That whole thread means not to expect packs over 30/20/whatever, it doesn't insult large packs ( much ) It's message is that a lot of people expect large packs, 50-100 presets, and they shouldn't do so.<br />
      <br />
      MattFury, That was actually very useful advice, and I actually haven't seen you be annoying ever reall. Why does everyone Flame you.<br />
      Why do I multiply SCC's a lot?<br />
      Because it is easier than using megabufs and loops to make a particle engine. but I will pay attention to that from now on<br />
      <br />
      Why multi filter?<br />
      Ok, There you are exactly right, I do use multifilter a lot, and the colour modifier a lot. Too Much. the probem is, to actually chrome somthing ( with the refleting and such ) takes a Dm with a large amount of code and A high gridsize.<br />
      <br />
      Why not fadeout?<br />
      <br />
      I'm not sure what you mean, but if you mean the additive clear screens and additive inverted unique tones, The first one is just a bad habit, with the same effect ecxactly, but the second is a very different effect, That preserves bright colours.<br />
      <br />
      No render modes?<br />
      I find most render modes ugly, but I do use maximum blend, Additive, Subtractive 1, Minimum Blend, and (very) occasionally sub blend 2.</p>

      <p class="post-content">as long as you have no prior colouring the multi filter trans if set at chrome x1 can be reproduced with a simple colour map that goes like this:<br />
      black----------------white-------------black<br />
      chrome x2:<br />
      black----white-----black-----white-----black<br />
      and so on.<br />
      this save a lot of fps.</p>

      To do a chome and keep the colours intact. Make a multiply blend colour filter with input of maximal channel, and colours like this<br />
      black----white---black.<br />
      then add a 2x brightness filter

      <p class="post-content">Are you sure that you did all of this stuff on your own? No remixes or forgotten to give credit? I really don't want to offend you, but some presets really look familiar to me. A bit too many for an accident...<br />
      But if you really made everything on your own, then please tell me how many time you normally spend to make presets, cause they are all pretty good and can't be a minute work!<br />
      <br />
      i have only seen some presets and i probably never will see all cause they're just tooo much. You can't expect that those who dl your pack will take the time to see all of your presets. I know it's hard to reject a preset from a pack, but you should consider reducing your packsize a lot. This will certainly improve your packquality!</p>
