      I just tried using the SVP loader... doh, can't believe I missed that before :)<br />
      <br />
      Anywayz, It runs the original Sonique rotozoomer but the darn thing can't find any images.. even though I have copied them into just about every directory there is! So close.. yet so far... sigh... Anyone used the svp loader to run plugins that reference external files?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hmmmm, I'll bet the thing looks in the Sonique folder. Try reading whatever documentation came with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">LOL.. if it was that easy it would have been working in 5 mins :) It is installed in the Sonique folders and works within Sonique. But when run under the svp loader it obviously has path issues and as such can't find anything. I even replicated the Sonique file structure inside winamp but to no avail... me thinks it gets some info from the Sonique api variables and uses that to find it's location... och well I have pretty much given up now anywayz.. onto a more doable project! :)</p>

      just something of my own little remix packs ^.^<br />
      <br />
      beware! due to the stupidity to the pimp script maker (namely name :) ) the .svp 's are accidently installed into the winamp\ folder just move these to your winamp\plugins\avs\ folder in order fgor them to work properly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey! thanks for that... :)<br />
      <br />
      I actually have every single Sonique vis there ever was (I think)... I used Sonique for ages... used to love the cool visuals.... so I have tried using most of them In Winamp... most work fine.. although I miss Rapa, but I guess avs does something similar... just wish you could use svp's that use external references.... I took a peak at the ape code on the dev site.. but I'll be buggered if I can follow some of it... I get the general gist but I don't have the time to fiddle with it.. bah.. well maybe some day :) In the meantime, I'm just sticking to a small avi with 10 of my favourite images in it... works okay.. just a memory hog.</p>
