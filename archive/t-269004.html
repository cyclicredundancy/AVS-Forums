<div class="posttext">Yet again i'm asking one of these &quot;how does this work&quot; as opposed to &quot;how do I do x...&quot; questions, the reason being final year uni project in AVS, gotta explain it all in a report yadda yadda ... anyway's I can explain pretty much everything i've made, apart from this one: what i don't get is how the kelideioscope effect is being acheived, i get how the shape is repeated at the edges, but where are the smaller versions which seem like their in the background come from? I know it's something to do with the comb of DM and blitter feedback, but mainly because if i remove either of them it stops. What exactly does a DM do if you apply before effects? Answers to all these questions (and more, but this'd be great start) will actually help to sleep easy in my bed tonight<br />

oh, and just out of intrest, why can't you just upload avs files?</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Suggestion:<br />
1: Look for pak-9's avs programming guide to learn about dms<br />
2: Check the tips n tricks section for ideas.<br />
3: Kalaidascope presets can be made easily.<br />
4: Find Zen-x packs they're loaded with kalaidascopes effects.<br />
<br />
Also you say you checked the forums.<br />
But this and the other topics are easily located in the avs folders if you know the right &quot;keyword&quot; to find them.<br />
<br />
example<br />
search for kalaidascope in only the avs thread that way you find only posts that have the word kalaidascope in them.<br />
<br />
I'm not tryhing to be mean but these question you asked are easily found if you look.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Sorry, i might not have made myself clear, i'll try rephrasing the question: I have already meade the preset (see attached flie above), the problem is more that i need to provide  a peice of techincal text explaining how this works. I say this as i get the impression frrom your answer that you were thinking i needed help making the preset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">in your preset the dm processes every frame the generated image of the effect list.<br />
since the dm zooms out, and there is nothing to overwrite the whole screen, the whole image gets zommed out several times.<br />
thats where the little copies for the bg come from.</div></div><hr />
