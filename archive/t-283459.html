      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS window got resized too much until it has become too big and is unresizable.</strong><br />
      Yesterday I was playing around with the window size of the AVS window. I don't know how I managed to do it but I accidentally made it too big that the borders have all disappeared.<br />
      <br />
      It is now unmovable and unresizable. It is stuck at a full-screen like mode, although it is not the actual full screen mode.<br />
      <br />
      I can't use the classic "right click on taskbar and click move, then use arrow keys" too because that moves the main winamp window (behind the AVS window), not the AVS window. Tried restarting computer and AVS too.. But to no avail. Where is the size information stored? The registry? I might need to delete some keys / information to get this back to normal.<br />
      <br />
      Cannot see the main winamp window, eq and playlist too. I'm using winamp 5.5 with Classic Skin BTW. When I change skin, the window is once again normal, but it's stuck this way in classic skin.<br />
      <br />
      Anyone knows how to solve this problem? Thanks!</p>
