<div class="posttext">Hi folks, this is my first AVS pack...<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Ive included a total of 13 presets, although, one or two of them are remixes of each other =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, any feedback at all would be great. Esp. if someone out there could show me how to adjust dynamic movement to rotate and zoom/unzoom with respect to a fixed location. <br />
<br />
Thanks =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atom - Not bad, but try making something that is completely your stuff.  To make it zoom in and out you could add a variable(lets call it dz) to your superscopes.  Now because this variable has to be in synch with all the scopes your best bet will be to use getosc()(Atero will tell you not to use straight up getosc(), but I don't think it makes a big difference). Here's an example:<br />
BEAT: ddz=getosc(.2,.2,0);  (find a new value for z)<br />
FRAME: dz=.9*dz+.1*ddz; (slowly &quot;morph&quot; dz into ddz)<br />
PIXEL:iz=if(above(z3,0.1),1/(z3+dz),0); (just change this line.  this is what causes the zooming)<br />
Mainly, just try to understand it on your own.<br />
Hyperbole - Take out the r = r*r/log(r); movement and make it something else.  That isn't a very aesthetic movement.<br />
Retro - Not too great looking or complex, but I do like that you used SSC's, which are much more customizable than Render/Simple's.  Colors and shapes don't mix well and the movement isn't anything spectacular<br />
Star - Not bad, but gets kinda boring.  Try replacing the Roto Blitter with a nice direction changing morphing/sliding DM.<br />
Oni - Don't really like the sharp lines and it could use something more than solid areas(like a nice texture or background), but it is unique. Oh, and don't use the tentacles ape like that.  Use a nice SSC or such.<br />
ITV - Nothing spectacular.  You showcased that movement already in Hyperbole.  Use something else here.<br />
Colorbound - n00bish movement.  Come up with something a little more unique.<br />
Coil - Nothing spectacular.  Just a lot of SSC's with a water and blur thrown on top.<br />
Planescaping mk iii - Don't like the movement.  You've used this SSC before.<br />
Seperation anxiety version 2 - It's nice, but try to make your own SSC for it.<br />
Omnivision - Seen similar before.  Not terrible, but not terribly exciting either.<br />
Ant Metropolis - Kinda chaotic, and I'm tired of the bump/mosaic presets, but it's alright.<br />
Strobe - Would be good if it didn't hurt my eyes.:p  Decent strobe effect, but I've seen better.<br />
Overall: 2.8.  Not bad, but work on your technical stuff and aesthetics.  These are definitely good for a first pack, but aren't top notch.  Do some remixes and new presets and post them.  I will gladly help you with any questions you have(as long as you search the forums first:p ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Here is my review of your presets.<br />
<br />
Ant metropolis - Nice but I have seen better. The colors are fairly repetitive.<br />
<br />
Atom - For a first 3D AVS this is fairly nice it is better than how my first 3D avs was.<br />
<br />
Coil - Nice looking but it would be better if 99% wasn't taken out of something Unconed made.<br />
<br />
Colourbound - This is OK but it doesn't look as good as some of the others and it uses default movements which I don't like.<br />
<br />
Hyperbole - Nice but it doesn't always take advantage of the whole window.<br />
<br />
ITV - Ugly and what is the t variable in the bump for ?<br />
<br />
Oni - Not very nice looking and it does the useless t variable in the bump again. You used default movements and an ape.<br />
<br />
planescaping mk iii - Kind of ugly. You used a default movement and a useless t variable in the bump again.<br />
<br />
retro - Ugly. Useless t variable again and a default movement.<br />
<br />
seperation anxiety version 2 - Not very great but it is watchable. That DDM looks a lot like the default DDM.<br />
<br />
Star - Blurry so it is hard to see.<br />
<br />
Strobe - Flashes too much. Doesn't look very good and that looks like the default DDM.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this review is too harsh in some parts but some of these presets need work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">first thing i'd like to say is don't use the el-vis 3d engine.  learn it, and write one yourself (it'll end up like every other 3d &quot;engine&quot; out there, but the point is you know how it works).<br />
<br />
atom: kind of nice...see above :)<br />
hydrobole: too grainy and chaotic and static...<br />
retro: reminds me of some presets i did a long time ago...old-skool action :p<br />
star: nice effect here...gives me a couple ideas...the bump is just a slowdown tho.  use a texered scope instead.<br />
oil: very cool :)<br />
itv: don't like this one much.  also, the movement is aspect-dependant (the movement when the screen is square is different from when it is rectangular).<br />
colorbound: i really like this one...but i don't like when it goes all gray.  it's your bump...try using something different, like a unique tone or colormap.<br />
coil: good use of mirror, i like this one a lot :up:<br />
planescaping mk III: ick...use wrap on your movement :/<br />
seperation anxiety version 2: ick...too white, too grainy, too default.<br />
omnivision: gets repetitive, but the basic idea is good<br />
ant metropolis: like a tonic preset...except it doesn't suck.  might want to use a utone or something at the end so it doesn't look so gray.  also, you don't need an effect list for this...it's just set to replace/replace...<br />
strobe: niiice :D<br />
<br />
overall: nice ideas, esp. for a first try.  keep working.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Atero, what is the El-vis 3d Engine?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">well, a 3d ssc base written by elvis. its a lot slow I will say. but it has some advantages which would be useful for those new to complex math stuff..because all the rotations (rx,ry and rz) are in degrees.<br />
but they are then converted into radians. this makes it slow. then the point part can also be altered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">dirkdeftly</div><div class="date small text-muted">19th March 2003, 22:42</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">did i mention that engine is very hard to tweak?  make the code yourself so you know what does what and why.  then make extremely neat scopes that have extremely cool camera movements and rejoice at the fruits of your labor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your feedback guys. <br />
<br />
anubis: maybe im a bit thick but i didnt understand how to implement that zooming function at all. i guess i have to do some more research and experimentation :)<br />
<br />
Atero: I've been playing around with elvises 3d engine, and i think i've developed a rudimentary understanding of it. Pretty soon i think ill (hopefully) be able to make my own from scratch :).<br />
<br />
Sadly, there are still many many things that i still cant figure out for the life of me(like how to make a zooming out effect with a &quot;focus&quot; that is slightly above the image, looking down (so you can see the previous states of the input function). i guess the only way to get better at it is with practice. <br />
<br />
Anyway, im hard at work making remixes of my existing presets... i was just wondering what would be better for all of you, posting them one at a time, or making a remix pack?<br />
<br />
Once again, thank you anubis2003, Atero and hungryskull for giving me indepth reviews and hints. I hope to repost my remixes for your perusal sometime soon =)<br />
<br />
[EDIT]: oh yah, i almost forgot ^^. Is there any way to &quot;freeze&quot; the animation for a set time/beat period? (when i say freeze, i mean like the effect thats seen when you right click on some avs'es)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">You can put them in on beat effect lists so that they only refresh on beat.  And if you don't want it to be on beat, then you can use a custom BPM.</div></div><hr />

plus, that post you just made was even worse of a contribution to these forums that Raz's posts, IMO.  Just try to keep these forums a friendly place for people to find out more about AVS</div></div><hr />

those two posts were to alert whoever had not posted their presets after advertising them that they weren't there. People will only go back to their thread if there are replies. Any replies.<br />
<br />
A few pointless posts i admit, some of them are slightly funny though (well they seemed to be when i typed them... never mind) but we're talking about something completely different here. I sometimes don't make a valued contribution. You on the other hand continually ressurect threads. I was simply pointing out that you shouldn't of done unless you had something important to add (which you obviously didn't) because it's irritating and pointless. You didn't have to bring up irrelevant information to try and put me down when all i'm doing is trying to stop dead threads being ressurected.</div></div><hr />
