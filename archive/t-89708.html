		Yay, I made a sphere using spherical coordinates. :D<br />
<br />
It's a bit wonky, but hey. still a work in progress as you may be able to tell from the name. :)

		I may be able to do some scopes, but DM I cannot do. You'd think that I could, but I have a mental block in there somewhere. :hang:<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Actually, I thought about it a bit. I dont think it possible to do real 3D with a DM. The best we can do is fake it withalpha blending on a distorted 2D surface. I don't you can actually have one point pass behind/infront of another.

		Here, take a look. Turn off blend in the DM to see what I mean about faking it.

		Jaheckesafar: actually my 3D DM's (e.g. Zero-G Maze) are pretty 'real' 3D. The DM performs raytracing for each point on the grid. The geometry is only limited by equations that you can solve easily. E.g. a torus would be very hard because you have to solve a quartic (4th order) equation.
