		I'll ad mit it, I steal from the greats from time to time. Case in point, Eight-Bit Metablobs. I ripped the basis from Whacko AVS 6 - Microscopic Metablobs and trimmed some (IMO) excess stuff from it before crueelly butchering it the way I id to give it an eight-bit-console blockiness :p.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's the ZIP archive for it, have fun.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the Channel Shift and Texer APEs, you'll need to put those in the Winamp AVS directory (\plugins\avs in Winamp 2.x and earlier, and \Wacs\data\avs for Winamp3 if I remember rightly) - ditto with the bitmap the Texer uses.

		It's a little bit boring, a little bit ugly, it does have some sort of 8-bit look I guess, but I don't think it needed it because it looks better without it.

		That's pretty <b>lame</b> i think. You just took the scope from UnConeD's preset and added some other effects... Try coding your own metablobs if you want to do shit like this.

		:weird: I thought you knew...in every comment in any of UnConeD's presets, he says that you can use any parts of his presets, as long as you credit his work for the parts you took in a comment in your preset.<br />
<br />
Which is precisely what I did.<br />
<br />
Odd that you've never read those comments in his presets...or do you just not bother?<br />
<br />
In re: Tuggummi's comment - <br />
<br />
Yes, well, I have a real life, which really fucks up my AVSing practice schedule. Sorry you think it's lame, but I just haven't had the time to practice - so that preset was a sort of &quot;get back in the groove thing&quot;. :hang:

		Clashman, maybe so, but you should know what i think about these kind of presets &quot;Gee let's take someone elses work and add some random stuff on it and post it at winamp! That would be so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Besides, it's either me or atero, you probably won't be safe about bitching no matter how hard you try :p

		Mhm. Well, now that I have your attention :P, perhaps you could help me.<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
<br />
I need to create a wrappable movement that acts like a non-beat-detecting Blitter Feedback set to zoom in, for the preset I'm currently working on is using that sort of Blitter Feedback, and there's a gaping HOLE in the center of the preset.<br />
<br />
I do not like holes in my presets. Have you a solution?

		Hmm... im not 100% sure, but i think what you need is a source mapped movement with x=x*zoom ; y=y*zoom , for zoom use a under 1 value like 0.9... or smaller or higher, but not above 1.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
sorry, that ain't the solution, that zooms the picture without the edge wrapping... i don't know what you mean, care to post a example?<br />

		Well, i have to say, its not as good as the orig, and it certainly doesnt bring anything new to the idea. But oh well, your doing beter than many.<br />
<br />
BTW, here is my take on the whole meta-blobs thing. I made this a while ago when i was making particles that bounce off of the walls, its a bit fps chocky because i havnt bothered cleaning it up yet.<br />
Oh, and she'll need a good beat to get 'er started. :D :D<br />
<br />
Ive got a better version of it going in the pack, but it isnt very metablobish, its more crazy-flow-plasma-stykle. :igor:<br />
<br />
Gota love that bump'in.

No problem, here's the preset I'm having trouble with - due to the hole, I call it &quot;A Hole In My Mind&quot;. What I want is a wrapped movement effect similar to that the blitter used in the preset creates.

		Hmm... You're zooming out_wards here and the wrap doesn't have any effect when zooming ******ds. If you want to zoom inwards &amp; out_wards, then you can use a movement with d=sin(d*1.2)*0.9 it zooms out_wards from the sides and inwards from the middle. Hope this is what you mean or need... Unless you're talking about basic zooming with the movement? I think you know how to use zoom and rotation with a movement, so i doubt that :)

		Worth a shot...<br />

*injects custom movement*<br />

Ahh, much better!

		For zooming in polar coords you just use d=d*zoom , anything above 1 zooms it ******ds and anything below 1 zooms it inwards.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure :)

		Righto.<br />
<br />
*gives that a shot as well*<br />
<br />
...Um, I gather that the d=d*zoom should be in a Dynamove, 'cause it sure as hell doesn't work in a normal movement.

		d=d*zoom does'nt work in a normal mov cause in calculates only in PER PIXEL,And it does'nt have ONBEAT changes, in short it is meant only for static movements.
