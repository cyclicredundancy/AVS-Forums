      <p class="post-content">well i searched and found the AVS tutorial but now i'm just fukin confused to hell.....<br />
      i knew it'd be the math that kept me from getting good at this, all that cosine and Pi stuff just makes my head spin (math was always my worst subject)</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah i figured that, but well i was quite dumb (with math) in school and well i dropped out my second year of highschool so i don't really know much more than a bit of algebra plus i took the easy math classes (NOT REMEDIAL ;))</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>Isn't it called trigonometry(it's probably still wrong, that's how it's pronounced).<br />
      <br />
      You also don't really need to know trig. I don't know any trig or any algebra. I've just figured out how to use the sine and cosine to make things move and look good.

      <p class="post-content">trigoniomsomething is like goniometrsomething but then in 3D I guess? If you know goniom.. then trigoniom.. comes with experience.</p>
