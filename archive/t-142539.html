      features<br />
      * autodetection of winamp 2+3<br />
      * visual customisation<br />
      * support for most common ape's<br />
      <br />
      todo<br />
      * font support<br />
      * ?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Pimpbot gets 5 stars from me, definately a very useful tool for all the n00bs, morons and lazy people out there, and very clever use of NSIS to make the thing in the first place.<br />
      <br />
      It must of taken some time to make considering what NSIS code is like for doing anything other than copying files.</p>

      </blockquote>the latest version (1.0.4) has this feature. just click the checkbox on the bottom (yes, next major version definitely needs a new layout!).<br />
      <br />
      to get this to work properly put the subdirs (using the desired names for installation!) in an empty dir and select this in the <i>AVS Directory</i> dialog.<br />
      <br />
      ps: will hopefully not touch this for a while, since i might be on holiday from tomorrow on. it's gonna be a spontaneous decision.

      <p class="post-content">Excellent program, but I really wish I could add extra APEs. Or even better, I'd like to be able to see the actual script as jheriko suggested. Until that happens, I'm not sure I'll be able to use it. Still, a great start, and it does exactly what it says it does very efficiently!</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can (i think): just put the extra APEs in your images/video section. It should work (although it might take only .bmp and .avi files). What extra APEs do you want to include? this has most of them covered.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><a href="http://nsis.whyeye.org/pimpbot_1-1-0rc2.zip" target="_blank">PimpBot v1.1.0 RC2</a><br />
      * updated layout<br />
      * supports multiple scripts<br />
      * additional/updated APEs<br />
      * new default script<br />
      <br />
      still couldn't implement font-support, since i'd require a plugin for nsis which can read the font-name from a font-file.<br />
      <br />
      also i want to point out, why people can't simply pick their own APEs or update the exisiting ones. the reason lies in the security i want to provide with pimpbot. if it had the features mention above, one could install APEs containing malicious code. using pimpbot is so to speak a quality/security predicate.<br />
      <br />
      report bugs in the <a href="https://forum.visbot.net/viewtopic.php?t=17" target="_blank">visbot forum</a>.<br />
      <br />
      the final version will be released, once yet unknown bugs were eliminated and after the release of nsis 2 beta 4.<br />
      <br />
      the current version requires <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/site/index.php" target="_blank">nsis 2 beta 3</a>, it does not yet work with the current cvs or upcoming versions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i seriously see a flaw in your logic here jan. if someone could code an ape that contained malicious code (and yes they'd have to code it theirselves; you'd be hard pressed to find an ape virus anywhere in the first place), then they could quite easily make their own nsis script for it.<br />
      aside from that, i think you're being far too paranoid. avs is not the distribution method of choice for neonazi virus writers anymore.</p>

      i just don't like the idea of people going halfway with something because they're worried about something stupid.<br />
      <br />
      #1: NOBODY is going to program an .APE virus, hence<br />
      #2: NOBODY is going to sue you over it. And<br />
      #3: if someone does program a virus and distributes it with pimpbot, victims can't even make a good case about how it's your fault. It'd be about as effective as suing Borland because they make the compiler O Dickhead used to make his ickle trojan. (However, I honestly would like to see them sue AOL cos they own the rights to Winamp/AVS and win; not only would this be fucking hilarious, it'd also mean that we could sue Microshaft over the Blaster virus.)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero's right. There's no logical argument for preventing external .APEs. Anyone capable of making malicious code execute via AVS or it's components doesn't require a front end for NSIS with features specific to AVS installers. I'd equate the logic of not allowing this with tool manufactures not producing a tool like a nail gun because it *could* be used as a weapon. I can use a pencil to stab a person's eye out. Does that mean that person or his family can sue Shelbyville Pencil Company? (that's a real pencil company [and the name of Springfield's sister-town in the Simpsons ;) ]) Well, I supposed they could try to bring suit against them, but I doubt they'd even be allowed to go to court, let alone be capable of winning.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you're that worried about malicious code, then implement a digital signature and watermarking system, with MD5 encryption. So that say, a user downloads a 'Zevensoft AVS Pack' it can check online and send it's signature (encoded via public key) to a central server, which can send a return (encoded via private key) which says "Verified Zevensoft Product" or summin like that.</p>

      <br />
      Choose a folder really big and then goto this folder C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Local Settings\Temp\YITMP (for xp), or just download the file at the bottom.

      the closer the release of winamp 5 comes, the more i'm asking myself, if there is still the need to support winamp 3.<br />

      <font size="1">hint for pure-krypton: the more elegant way of getting both scripts would be downloading them from the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=323" target="_blank">nsis archive</a> - lol</font></p>
