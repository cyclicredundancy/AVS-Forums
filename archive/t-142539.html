<div class="posttext">pimpbot can best be described as a frontend for nsis 2 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net). within a few mouse-clicks it compiles an installer, which is custom-made for avs.<br />
<br />
features<br />
* autodetection of winamp 2+3<br />
* visual customisation<br />
* support for most common ape's<br />
<br />
todo<br />
* font support<br />
* ?<br />
<br />
please note that you need nsis 2 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) to run pimpbot.<br />

<div class="posttext">Pimpbot gets 5 stars from me, definately a very useful tool for all the n00bs, morons and lazy people out there, and very clever use of NSIS to make the thing in the first place. <br />
<br />
It must of taken some time to make considering what NSIS code is like for doing anything other than copying files.</div></div><hr />

Nice job ! though it would be cool to add more than one AVS dir to installer. i.e if I'd pimp d+ with this I'd have to do three installers (1 for each part) <br />
<br />
the latest version (1.0.4) has this feature. just click the checkbox on the bottom (yes, next major version definitely needs a new layout!).<br />
<br />
to get this to work properly put the subdirs (using the desired names for installation!) in an empty dir and select this in the AVS Directory dialog.<br />
<br />
ps: will hopefully not touch this for a while, since i might be on holiday from tomorrow on. it's gonna be a spontaneous decision.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Excellent program, but I really wish I could add extra APEs. Or even better, I'd like to be able to see the actual script as jheriko suggested. Until that happens, I'm not sure I'll be able to use it. Still, a great start, and it does exactly what it says it does very efficiently!</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You can (i think): just put the extra APEs in your images/video section.  It should work (although it might take only .bmp and .avi files).  What extra APEs do you want to include? this has most of them covered.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PimpBot v1.1.0 RC2 (http://nsis.whyeye.org/pimpbot_1-1-0rc2.zip)<br />
* updated layout<br />
* supports multiple scripts<br />
* additional/updated APEs<br />
* new default script<br />
<br />
still couldn't implement font-support, since i'd require a plugin for nsis which can read the font-name from a font-file.<br />
<br />
also i want to point out, why people can't simply pick their own APEs or update the exisiting ones. the reason lies in the security i want to provide with pimpbot. if it had the features mention above, one could install APEs containing malicious code. using pimpbot is so to speak a quality/security predicate.<br />
<br />
report bugs in the visbot forum (https://forum.visbot.net/viewtopic.php?t=17).<br />
<br />
the final version will be released, once yet unknown bugs were eliminated and after the release of nsis 2 beta 4.<br />
<br />
the current version requires nsis 2 beta 3 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/site/index.php), it does not yet work with the current cvs or upcoming versions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">i seriously see a flaw in your logic here jan.  if someone could code an ape that contained malicious code (and yes they'd have to code it theirselves; you'd be hard pressed to find an ape virus anywhere in the first place), then they could quite easily make their own nsis script for it.<br />
aside from that, i think you're being far too paranoid.  avs is not the distribution method of choice for neonazi virus writers anymore.</div></div><hr />

* requires NSIS 2 Beta 4<br />
* Winamp 5 ready<br />

* minor fixes<br />
<br />
please, to see that this version is free of bugs, i need you people to test it. install NSIS 2.0 Beta 3 (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis20b3.exe?download), then download the nightly build (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip) of NSIS 2.0 Beta 4 and unzip it to your NSIS installation path. this version of pimpbot will *not* work with old NSIS 2 betas!<br />
<br />
how you can help me:<br />
* test the script using both of the default scripts (hybridis and minis)<br />
* try the features you would use for your personal installer<br />
* try the features you would never use for your personal installer<br />
* post bugs here or at the official forum (https://forum.visbot.net/viewtopic.php?t=17)<br />
<br />
since i havn't experienced any bugs in this version, i gave it free for public testing, considering it works. anyway, the final version will be available shortly after the release of the final (beta 4?) of NSIS 2. i also consider waiting for unconed to fix his colormap and texer APEs :p <br />

i just don't like the idea of people going halfway with something because they're worried about something stupid.<br />
<br />
#1: NOBODY is going to program an .APE virus, hence<br />
#2: NOBODY is going to sue you over it.  And<br />
#3: if someone does program a virus and distributes it with pimpbot, victims can't even make a good case about how it's your fault.  It'd be about as effective as suing Borland because they make the compiler O Dickhead used to make his ickle trojan.  (However, I honestly would like to see them sue AOL cos they own the rights to Winamp/AVS and win; not only would this be fucking hilarious, it'd also mean that we could sue Microshaft over the Blaster virus.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Atero's right.  There's no logical argument for preventing external .APEs.  Anyone capable of making malicious code execute via AVS or it's components doesn't require a front end for NSIS with features specific to AVS installers.  I'd equate the logic of not allowing this with tool manufactures not producing a tool like a nail gun because it *could* be used as a weapon.  I can use a pencil to stab a person's eye out. Does that mean that person or his family can sue Shelbyville Pencil Company? (that's a real pencil company [and the name of Springfield's sister-town in the Simpsons ;) ])  Well, I supposed they could try to bring suit against them, but I doubt they'd even be allowed to go to court, let alone be capable of winning.</div></div><hr />
