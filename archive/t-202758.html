      <p class="post-content"><strong>another message to the reviewers</strong><br />
      when i'm browsing the plugins section on this site, i often come across comments, complaining about the number of presets in a release. i think it's time to face the fact, that with all the new possibilities, avs has become more complex. the times of 50 presets per pack are over, except for noob stuff maybe.<br />
      <br />
      for my own pack, i made 16 presets in 13 months and i hear similiar from others. during the process of creation, i took some presets out of the selection, cause they didn't appear to be "modern" anymore. what i'm trying to say with this is, that the reviewers should get used to smaller releases (10-25 presets?) and consider what i said before, when rating packs.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Re: another message to the reviewers</strong><br />
      This is just my opinion.<br />
      <br />
      If the pack has 10 or less presets then it's small. It really should be considered a minipack (especially if there are 6 or less presets) and say so clearly in the pack name (but that's just my<br />
      opinion). If they're clearly noob presets, I complain, and explain that the pack size should be bigger (and why).<br />
      <br />
      11-20 - a medium sized pack. Won't complain much about the size usually (I might if the variety of presets is small)<br />
      <br />
      21-30 - a big pack. I'll never complain about the size. Again, I might if the variety is too small, but that's extremely har to achieve when there are that many presets.<br />
      <br />
      31+ - a huge pack. If the quality of the presets is high, it'll get higher grades for the effort. If it's low (aka. noob-puts-everything-he-ever-made). Then it's considered bloated and might get lower grades.<br />
      <br />
      Remix packs are a different sort (it the author clearly states that they are remix packs). If those are all remixes of one preset, it should be considered a minipack even if there are 15 of them because of the lack of variety. However, if the variety is high (and it usually is), it counts as a normal pack.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and sorry I couldn't reply earlier. I was away from the net for more than a month, came back a couple of days ago, and opened this board just today.<br />
      <br />
      And why is it that you never hear someone say thank you to the reviewers. All we get is either bitching or idiotic sarcasm, or if we're lucky (this example) constructive criticism. I mean, I just reviewed more than 20 skins and around 10 packs to clear out the queue. That's extremely hard mental work you know.<br />
      <br />
      My head still hurts from yesterday's khm... celebration, so this might not be exactly what I mean. I'll revise it once my head clears up.</p>

      i think we're getting a bit too offtopic here, For me a 15-20 preset pack would be decent enough. I'm thinking bout releasing a pack with 15 presets in a few weeks......will that be enough?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Umm.... I read your post, then I read it again. I understand you perfectly. Well, at least I think I understood you perfectly. Please be more specific on what you think I didn't get. For me, a pack of 10/less presets IS small no matter the quality. However, if the presets are good/great, and it's obvious that some effort was put into them, I won't complain. I know that it's VERY hard to make a lot of complex presets, and the pack's quality not quanitity will count. However, if it's full of dot fountain + water presets, it will get lower rating than the average quality of the presets would get it. It's logical. I guess. That is (at least mine) our way of getting used to the smaller number of presets in a pack due to the reasons you stated. Before, when people did quality packs (for their own time) with 20+ presets regularly, I would've complained. Now I don't.<br />
      <br />
      I probably won't see your answer because I might be experiencing some technical difficulties with my internet connection soon, which could result in my prolonged absence from the net. I'll try to sort some things out before that. Clearing the queue is my priority right now.</p>
