		I would dl it, but if I did I would be forced to go and look at every single preset, which I don't have the time for right now.  I'll look at it some time soon(maybe tomorrow) and tell you what I think.

		That's sweetness.  Time to write a big-ass review. j/k.:p   A ton of presets, and they are amazingly good for such a large pack.

sure man, just take it :)<br />

It's probably my last pack, but I'll probably continue doing remixes and giving them to different AVS projects &amp; give presets for FF. Never say never though, if the presets keep coming and no-one needs them, I could even gather them in one pack..
