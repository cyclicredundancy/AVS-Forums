      <p class="post-content"><strong>hope this helps</strong><br />
      Hope these are a little help. There's not nearly enough of them, and many of them are too similar to the other presets, so just pick out some of the faster ones that you like the best. Feel free to use them &amp; modify them (I appreciate it if credit is given) as you feel fit.<br />
      <br />
      You'll have to cut some of the slow ones out that were never intended to go into my VJ pack for high fps (I didn't have the time to make separate zip files). Don't forget to download the other .zip files in that thread (there's several different zip files), because there's additional presets that have an entirely new look (less repetition among the presets compared to 1st .zip file in the thread)<br />
      <br />
      The thread is called Sneak peek at AVS pack!!! Use the link in my sig to go to the thread &amp; then download *all* the zip files to the same folder (whatever you decide to name it, make sure they're all in the same one) then just delete the ones that are repetitious or are too slow.<br />

      <p class="post-content">My pack....Not completely finished but it might help you get closer to 400...<br />
      <br />
      By the way, finding presets to match your requested frame rate is hard seeing as you havent given any system specs...</p>
