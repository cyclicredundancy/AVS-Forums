      dj_fender, the preset itself isn't too bad. However, ripping is highly frowned upon.

      Seriously, I am sick and tired of people posting anywhere with every single word capitalised. Its wrong in every sense of the word:<br />
      <br />
      Grammatically incorrect<br />
      Slower to type<br />
      Harder to read<br />
      Easy to deduce as being wrong

      <p class="post-content">Depends on the language, jheriko; in German, all nouns are capitalised. Thing I hate is the hubris of assuming that somehow language can be re-invented (or worse, re-presented) to suit the endless pathetic needs of some soulless ego, who is an emotional trainwreck, and wants to take as many down with 'it' as is un-humanly possible.<br />

      Nice rant, huh.</p>

      <p class="post-content">don't worry. you couldn't know how people react, at least you made up. you should join <a href="http://deviantart.com" target="_blank">deviantart</a> and find some people you'd love their stuff to get remixed by you.<br />
      <br />
      looking forward to your new stuff, just keep them coming.</p>
