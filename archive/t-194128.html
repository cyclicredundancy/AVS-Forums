<div class="posttext">congratulations on your excellent buzzword collection!<br />
<br />
...but what did you want to say us?<br />
<br />
read, think, post</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">1) Avs is NOT xml based in any possible way. Avs is coded highly in assembler.<br />
2) AVS is NOT directX based, avs is ONLY cpu based<br />
3) its very complex to make avs parse c++ to asm (what avs currently does with its script, parses it to asm and then runs it...basic compiler, theres where the speed of avs comes)<br />
4) winamp 5 is not xml based anymore and winamp 3 sucks</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Maybe you should try R4, i hear you can use bunch of weird-ass scripting and coding languanges in it :igor:<br />
<br />
But for the future, here are some keywords AVS does not interact with.<br />
<br />
AVS &amp; 3D Acceleration = X<br />
AVS &amp; High Resolutions = X<br />
AVS &amp; High Framerates = X<br />
AVS &amp; Direct X = X (ooh sorry, you already said that. My bad)<br />
AVS &amp; other scripting/coding languanges = X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username text-primary">sidd</div><div class="date small text-muted">21st September 2004, 15:45</div></div>
<br />
<div class="posttext">hmm, if you cant code in directX, maybe its a problem with your flash internet DSL. Remember that you have to keep your scripts under 1.32ghz, or it causes a buffer overflow in winamp's meta-kernel. <br />
<br />
If that doesnt work, then you'll probably just need to switch over to a non-lossy GPS, That way the subpixels should be able to interplex with the extra R-flops that DX will have in the register node.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">hey sidd i didnt know you were so well-versed in extended APS graphics stuff<br />
oh btw you forgot to tell him to use a TB mask for the subpixels</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">The only way people are going to get avs to run better is to get a faster cpu, that way not only avs runs faster but your whole system!</div></div><hr />

do you see somebody complaining about speed here? anyways: CPU speed getting faster has slowed down, and now keyword is parallelism, and avs doesnt take much advantage of parallel computing (only dm and movement effects i think). Tho' faster memory and larger chache can speed avs up quite a bit if im correct</div></div><hr />

<br />
<div class="posttext">Or simply optimize your code, and don't use it if it's not needed. That helps the most I guess.</div></div><hr />

I'll just include why do you mock me of my intellectulism, maybe im not good at maths *trying 2 improve* but, im not trying to ask as many &quot;stupid&quot; questions, and UnconeD knowing that im a webdesigner,... that was a poor effort of sarcasm... lol:igor: <br />

<div class="posttext">ok to clear things up:<br />
can we use vbscript ? in winamp?<br />
why would anyone want to use vbscript for anything? it's incompatible, limited and a pain to write<br />
i think its strange because it's xml based player;<br />
wrong, winamp is NOT xml based<br />
<br />
why can't we use c++, or other programming languages<br />
use them for what?<br />
in a direct x based avs?<br />
avs is not direct x based and will never be</div></div><hr />
