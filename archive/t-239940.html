      Funny, it looks as if you posted this right after you submitted the deviation. Be sure to look at the time in the bottom right corner and then at the time of your post. I saw this on the forums, <b>two</b> days ago, but it hasn't yet been on deviantART.<br />
      <br />
      Either way, the pack is okay. There's a lot of kaleidoscopic presets which aren't bad, but quickly loose my interest. I remember <i>Inside The Jelly</i>, but agree that the remix is much better.

      <p class="post-content">It's really nice. You have some presets that have a nice effect even though there is just basic coding. You need to learn more advanced coding otherwise the pack is really nice.</p>
