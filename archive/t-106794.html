<div class="posttext">I use lots of avi&amp;bmp in my presets...I think it would be really great to have color&amp;luma keying in the input/output mode in presets list....I know my english is bad and I hope you'll understand this wish :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">You shouldn't use BMP or AVI if you don't have to.  Remember, not everyone has broadband.<br />
<br />
But that brings up another wish: JPG/GIF/PNG/PICT/etc. compatibility...<br />
<br />
(Sorry to take away from the thread)<br />
<br />
Carry on... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I use lot of bmp/avi files in my presets but they're only to be shown at parties... ( e.g http://vfx0.free.fr/VFX-Bzh-24-08-2002.avi )....but if animated gif files were supported (with transparent color) that would be perfect :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PNG is the format of the future. It looks better and has better features, not least of those being a alpha channel. I use PNG (48-bit RGB with Alpha Channel) when rendering from 3dsmax. PNG-support in AVS would rule. :up:</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">PNG is good for SOME things.  JPEG is good for SOME things.  GIF is good for SOME things.  BMP isn't good for ANYTHING.  They need to change it somehow, I don't care to what, they just need to change it.  (also you should be able to do 'keep aspect ratio' on both axes.  and they need a wider variety of render blends so you don't have to do a seperate effect list.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">No no no, you got it wrong :).<br />
<br />
JPEG is good for some things.<br />
PNG is good for some things.<br />
<br />
GIF is obsolete.<br />
<br />
It's as simple as that. If you take an identical GIF and PNG, the PNG will be smaller (Atero: provided they have the same color depth! don't compare an 8-bit GIF with a 24-bit PNG). Except maybe for those cheezy animated gif's that no-one uses. Though I think that's what MNG is for.<br />
This is not a &quot;Playstation 2 vs X-Box&quot; or whatever issue where the argument can go on forever. PNG is open, patent-free, more efficient and more featured than GIF. That's really it. Anyone who claims otherwise has never done any serious graphic work :) (I'm a 'pixelspotter').</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been saying that for years. The fact that I have been saying it for years is supportive evidence for that fact too.<br />
<br />
.png and .jpg are nice but I think it is possible to push compression even further.<br />
<br />

BMP isn't good for ANYTHING<br />
<br />
.bmp is fast to load (not that that matters these days) due to lack of compression (by default) and the simplicity of the file format.<br />
<br />
<br />
.bmp is good for me because I haven't gotten around to learning how to load a .jpg or .tga into a data structure of use to me for making a texture from.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that we could do with some alterative file types supported by render/picture or render/avi just because it can keep the size of our packs down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">I'll see if I can't whip up a better Render / Picture. I believe Intel has a free JPEG library, and I could use libpng for PNG.<br />
<br />
I also think the current render picture is waaaaay too slow. I think it scales the image in realtime. A much faster approach would be to scale it once and keep that in a buffer (bilinear filtering anyone? :))</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">Well, loading a JPG should actually be faster than BMP, because of the fact that less bandwidth is used. The only reason it's sometimes slower is because it needs to be decoded, which is slow.<br />
<br />
Have 3 options for enlarge (None, Bilinear, Median) and 2 options for shrink (None, Anti-Aliased).<br />
<br />
Do you reckon you could make it anti-alias the EXACT amount (For each pixel) by calculating the area of each subtexel in each pixel? Or would that be too hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="posttext">intel have a fre jpg library, it's ijl15.dll<br />
<br />
here's a pic of what i want to do with 1 avi (the fractal) and the picture (mask):<br />

<br />
I wouldn't dream of decoding a JPG realtime every frame. Even if you do gain speed from having to read less data, JPG is not very memory conservative when it comes to decoding it, so it'd be slower anyway.<br />
<br />
As I said:<br />
A much faster approach would be to scale it once and keep that in a buffer (bilinear filtering anyone?)<br />
<br />
That pretty much explains it. Asidee from photorealistic images, AVS pictures tend to be low-color ones. Using a RLE scheme should give a minor speed increase as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i disagree<br />
what if you are stuck at someone's house who doesnt have the money for nice editing programs, and doesnt have the bandwith to download them?<br />
ill answer for you: You are stuck with MSPaint<br />
that is one of the few occations when .bmp is ok<br />
(and gif sucks) :p</div></div><hr />
