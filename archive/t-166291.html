      i was messing with 3d ssc's the other day and made this thingy, but i can't quite figure out how to get the smallest ring to rotate around the right axis (look at the preset, you'll see). all the rings should rotate with respect to the medium-sized ring, and it should run around 150fps (why doesnt avs have the 60fps limiter anymore?)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it's because of the order of rotation. The outer ring is rotating on the Z axis and since you're rotating the entire shape by x, y, then z it works out. But since the X axis is the first to rotate it doesn't work right. You might have to rotate the inner ring twice. Once for the independent x rotation and then for the x,y,z rotation of the middle ring.</p>
