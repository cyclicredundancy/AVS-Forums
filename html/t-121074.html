Take out the color cycler in the superscopes - use red/green/blue instead so it is beat responsive. n can be dropped to 100. ra=rand(9)+1*.01; can be changed to ra=rand(9); and should change every beat. The bleedin' movement doesn't do much either. The main SS is also very repetitive.

R u saying that it doesnt need to be in that range for effect or it's wrong coding?? The cycling colous are there from one of my other muckaround presets that I changed I dont think it actually needs to cycle. So was the bleedin I haccidentally left that in there:o. Yeh bit lazy I guess thanks for the n tip I didn't think of that (preformance)...The beat detection is a great idea for the SSC because I had an eclipsoid shape in the previous unmodified code with the spectrum going inwards and it looked like a water mirror pool, I liked it but would like to change between the two seperate codes .. btw is that a 2.5 out of five ??? I hope not of 10 or 100 :cry:<br><br>RAZ_001: :) Thanks I'm glad you got something out of it. I kind of like the slight greyness of the colours It's intentional. I find it kinder on the eyes than 80's flurofantastichappypantsness .<br><br>The two things I would like to get a bit of a tute on is the red green blue comands and how they work and beat detection in those functions and in SSC. I understand how to use them in the on beat window but how do you get it to swap to a totaly seperate x= and y= code (SSC)??..<br><br>I'm losing it a bit with DM's I have printed out (and studied) some of Nic01's posts to cmountford and it's all on basics of DM'ing. They stopped and went on to SSC's just as it was getting interesting (lots of work went into that btw)nice 1. Has Nic01 or anyone else got some tutes for DM's that are a bit more advanced than simulating default movements and just getting slightly beyond that (dancehall effects and such).<br>I'm looking at learning things to make my head turn as emulating the basics used to and good personal tips on how to LAYOUT your code to keep it on track for more advanced code.<br><br>If anyone wants to remix it feel free just give me cred if u use it.<br><br>V :winamp: G</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th January 2003 19:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yes, 2.5 is out of 5. The code you have will make a random number between .1 and 8.1 because multiplications are carried out before additions. To make a random number between .01 and .1 use ra=(rand(10)+1)*.01;<br>Red/Green/Blue are variables that can be used to set the color of a superscope. They are each in the range of 0(none of that color) to 1(All of that color). Combinations of more than one will lead to different colors (i.e. Red + Blue = Purple). To do this you can use any other variables to define them per pixel or per frame(if you want the entire scope to be one color). For example to make red increase from left to right you can put at the end of the pixel editbox "red=x;" or to make it decrease from left to right use "red=-x;".<br>A better way to use it is to use on beat changes. In the onbeat box you can put something like "dr=rand(100)/100;" and then in the frame editbox you can put "red=.9*red+.1*dr;". You can do this with the other colors to create a smoothly changing color that changes on beat. This can also be used to change the x and y variables or anything you want.<br>The easiest way to have it switch on beat between two different SSCs is to use something like this:<br><br>Init: g=0;<br>Beat: g=bnot(g);<br>Pixel: x=g*&lt;x1&gt;+bnot(g)*&lt;x2&gt;; y=g*&lt;y1&gt;+bnot(g)*&lt;y2&gt;;<br><br>This will change sharply on beat (at least I think so) and I would tell you how to make it change smoothly but Winamp crashed on me so I can't check to make sure I'm right.<br>I hope this helps Visag.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">VisualAgnosia</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th January 2003 20:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">yes thank U.
