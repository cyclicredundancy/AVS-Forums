    No, really, you don't. Having written articles for the front page on numerous occasions, the sheer volume of hate mail you can get from it really isn't worth it.<br />

    The fucking flak I took for reviewing the Butthole Surfers album :cry:<br />

        </blockquote>i thought it's common knowledge that its the biggest mistake to use your real email-address here on winamp.com. i assume that due to its popularity some "spam-companies" scan the site for email-addresses.<br />
        <br />
        why i am assuming this?<br />
        <br />
        i had the suspicion when i first uploaded my winamp skins back in 1998. later when winamp 2 came out, i had to re-register myself, since the old account was gone. this time i god myself an email just for the purpose of uploading avs to winamp.com. shortly after (1 or 2 weeks) i was already flooded with spam (the regular enlarge your penis, make money, meet women etc stuff). remember, i only used the email for winamp.com.<br />
        <br />
        i notified the staff long time ago, back then they said there was no proof for a direct connection. well, that's not true. emails where addressed to the nick i'm using on winamp.com, the subject where in part related to winamp.com and even worse: one a first glance the senders looked like other avs people (jheriko, tuggummi etc). it turned out, the emails are not from them, but just another result of the winamp.com scan.<br />
        <br />
        sad but true :down:

        Yay for AVS!!!<br />
        Let's just hope they don't continue their coverage over to Devart... I'm guessing a filled mailbox (Read : 1 meg+ per mailcheck) for a good amount of us if that happens...<br />

        <p class="post-content">Well i also changed my email add to a bogus one a while ago, i used to get even responses to "my mails" that "i" have sent to some people... Stuff just like "So cool a flash, check it out" "Hentai XXX girls nude" :p<br />
        <br />
        Also i get a lot of emails from "Unconed" "Jheriko" "Danjoe" "Blazer" etc... :D<br />
        <br />
        Why can't winamp.com have a option to hide the email from public? Because i would still like get notified when a new pack has been reviewed... And also if i forgot my password how the hell im going to retrieve it if i have a address like "diespammer@sikanauta.com" :igor:</p>

        <p class="post-content">I've had the same hotmail adress for over a year and i get at least 40 or 50 spam e-mails a day. I've got the junk mail fileter on high though so it narrows it down to about 30 a day. I've got really good at figuring out whch ones are spam. and i get about 1 worth reading every couple of days. Fucking nightmare. And you're telling me it'll get worse when i release presets. /me goes off to create new e-mail address.</p>
