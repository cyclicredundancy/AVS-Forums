      As we are aproaching the release of Winamp5 Gold, we are also approaching the unveiling of a new winamp.com. There will be some changes, among them the AVS presets for Winamp 2 and Winamp3 will be in the same database. (Could be some presets will be in there twice as they have been submitted to both databases at this time.) Over time it would be good if the authors could update the installers of their Winamp3 presets so all will work for Winamp5, and delete the duplicates. Another is the Thumbnail screenshot, this will be 178x75 pixels. Right now the max width is 137, so you can't quite update them yet, but you might consider this for presets you will be publishing in about a month or so.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i was wondering about that. thanks for letting us know in advance.<br />
      <br />
      the new <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/archive/viewpage.php?pageid=323" target="_blank">pimpbot</a> already has winamp 5/avs 2.7 specific features. it will check which avs version the user is running and decide wether an external ape is necessary to be installed or not. the new settings window also resizes the avs window properly (the entries of the winamp.ini changed). i will wait for the final release of winamp 5 to see if there are more changes required, but right now it seems perfectly compatible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i don't have any "cross postings" , all my packs in classic.winamp.com as well as winamp.com are different. But still an uptade to the installers? fuck... i don't have any of the original scripts for those installers, tho it isn't a big thing to pimp them again. Will the packs be removed if i don't uptade? Also the thumbnail thing is pretty weird, i have used the same pic in both thumbnail and preview no matter what size since my 5th pack.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway... What's the avs directory in wa5? And what's the uninstallstring? (for autodetection of install dir) Do i need to know anything else? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">with the winamp 5 website, i hope you protect your supporters (skin + plugin makers) better than you do now. the simple feature of hiding one's email address would be such a step. at this moment, i use a non-existant email address for my profile, to avoid being spammed. the winamp website is being scanned (by spam companies) for email addresses very quickly.<br />
      <br />
      to prove my thesis, get a free email account and use it to register for an account. then upload a skin or a component. within a few days you will get shitloads of spam, even containing winamp related topics (i got spam-mails from other authors of components or skins, fake of course).<br />
      <br />
      however, before you ask, why i bother having changed my email to a fake address.. it might be useful at some point to recover my password for my account. a valid email would be required.</p>

      </blockquote>winamp 5 uses the same registy entry and installation directory as winamp 2

      <p class="post-content">Yes, protect us! I really want an option to hide my email ad, to prevent spam, but to be able to recover my password and to get notified when a skin/component is published! I currently as well have an fake email in my profile, if i happen to lose my password it's bye bye for all my components &amp; account... :(</p>
