It's Rovastar.:p Good to see you again. I am going to say something real quick, though. I think this thread does show a need for another mod. There was a pretty harsh flame war going on, and it took some time for a mod to notice it(or at least to make it known that they noticed it). I still think that a second mod could help a lot.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Phaze1987</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th March 2003 21:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Ok...mod atero already and stop the arguing and posting for no reason.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th March 2003 21:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Phaze, telling someone to mod the person directly involved in the flame war <u>won't</u> help the situation.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th March 2003 21:35 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Oh, piss off raz :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th March 2003 21:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">This thread is really starting to get on my nerves.
