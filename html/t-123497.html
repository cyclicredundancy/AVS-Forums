(in "In Pursuit"), because it looks like a ship from fsk's preset "Space Chase v2".<br><br>The intro looks nifty, but i guess you copied the idea from UnConeD's Whacko I pack :)<br><br>Nice presets, but if you used the ship made originally by fsk, you should credit him for it.<br><br>In the intro the scope that fills the circle looks ugly, don't use rand in the color code like that. Maybe you could use "spiral graph" like scopes with smooth color transitions, oh wait, unconed already did that... well try to figure something out :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th February 2003 12:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">intro:<br>multiple axes rotation would be neat... z-spinning is a bit boring<br><br>pursuit:<br><br>- Fix the aspect ratio (y=y*af; with af=w/h) to get rid of the squashed visor<br><br>- I'll repeat it again: spend time figuring out how to make values change the way you want rather than settling for a bouncy sin/cos combo. Make a simple dot superscope and try making it move around smoothly, at constant speed or with a steering motion, etc.<br><br>- Since you obviously don't quite understand getosc, here's what it does:<br><br>getosc(index,width,channel)<br>The oscillopscope or spectrum data is a series of values. Each of these 576 values is remapped to 0..1. So to access the 5th value, you use index 5/576. So index can be any value between 0..1 (with a maximul precision of 1/576)<br>The width parameter is when you want to find the average of a series of values. For example, a width of 0.1 will average 576*0.1 = 57 values, centered at the index specified. If the range you specified goes outside. The width parameter can be any value between 0..1<br>The channel parameter is a toggle that allows you to choose either left (1) or right (2) channel, or the average between them (0). This parameter is only 0, 1 or 2.<br><br>Use different indexes to get somewhat independent variables. For example for your visor, you use:<br>c=getosc(0.4,0,0.9);a1=getosc(0.4,0,0.9);<br><br>This is causing c to be the same as a1, and restricts the visor the the diagonal. Change one of the 0.4's into something else, and watch the visor be free :).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th February 2003 16:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">oh yeah, id changed that on a different version and forgotten about it.
