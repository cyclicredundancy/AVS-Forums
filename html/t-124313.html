Because if you say that something is, you are saying that something else isn't.

Their can be no paradoxes in physics. The easiest way for you to be able to kill yourself back in time would be if there was such thing as a multiverse(more than one universe). A new universe would be spawned at every decision - brush teeth or not; shoot myself or not - one where it does happen, one where it doesn't. In this way, to travel back in time would be as easy as transporting oneself to a universe that is at a different point in time. Read Michael Crichton's book <i>Timeline</i>. It's a really good book. Also, Stephen Hawking has written several [nonfiction] books on this topic.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">legohead</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th February 2003 22:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Dude the answer is actually quite simple yet quite complex.

Example? LIGHT! Since when does light arrive instantly and be everywhere? Never. And light does have a mass, ie. it gets pulled in by black holes. So that just broke a few 'theories' right there.<br><br>Time is a dimension. As such, it is impossible to change one's momentum in time, without affecting time itself. Let's imagine a car. You can move sideways in the back seat. We will assume all 3 dimensions of space into this 1 dimension of movement. Now time is the car moving forward. No matter how much you move sideways, you will always be travelling forward at the speed of the car.<br><br>Another thing which breaks the theory that all the universe must do what physics say is quantum emissions. Einstein himself hated these, as this was the hole in his 'theory of everything'. They are truly random, with no observable means of determining when they might occur.<br><br>What some people don't realize is just how big a dimension really is. 1 dimension is infinite. Having 3 to move in really is a lot. 4 is consiberable, but the human mind just cannot fathom the vastness of 10 or more dimensions.<br><br>Many people may not realize it, but even images they see and thoughts that might occur are still 2 dimensional, 'seeing' in 3 dimensions is rather hard to visualize. A 2D person can only see in 1D, as shown by a quick paper drawn experiment. To us he may look like he can see in 2D, but the truth is he can't. But us, being 3D and able to perceive 2D, can see all of him, inside him, and anything in his world, all at once.<br><br>Imagine being a 4D person looking at this 3D world. Of course this is hard to visualize, just as the 2D man has trouble visualizing his world as 2D from a 3D perspective. Now imagine how hard it would be for this 2D man to travel out of the peice of paper. Pretty hard hey? Well imagine us trying to do the same thing. This is what makes time travel so hard. Before we can move in the 4th dimension we must master the 3rd dimension first.<br><br>I think when some people say things like "11 dimensional" or "26 dimensional" they don't really understand just what they're saying. In relational terms, imagine a box. This box has a side length of 2cm. In 2 dimensions, it's area is 2^2cm, or 4cm^2. In 3, it's volume is 2^3cm, ie. 8cm^3. However in 11 dimension, this is 2^11cm, or 2048cm^11 of space. Absolutely HUGE space for storage, and it all fits in your pocket. But only if your pocket was 11 dimensional, and that you could 'even out' the object so that it filled all 11 dimensions.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">EnDurA</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th February 2003 07:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>light does have a mass, ie. it gets pulled in by black holes.</blockquote>blacks holes aren't exactly a hole, if u stood on one you'd probobly be ripped in half by the gravatational difference between your legs and your head.

Example? LIGHT! Since when does light arrive instantly and be everywhere? Never. And light does have a mass, ie. it gets pulled in by black holes. So that just broke a few 'theories' right there.</blockquote>You got time dilation wrong. The point is that time slows down <u>for the object</u> moving at speeds near the speed of light.<br>A great way of showing this is to examine muons. These are particles (we receive them from space) that have a very short decay time, much shorter than the time needed to travel from outside the atmosphere to the ground.<br>Yet many experiments exist (even ones you can do at home with dry-ice) that allow you to detect muons here on the ground.<br><br>The reason is that, because of their high speed (near the speed of light I think), time slows down for the particles, so their decay-time is stretched for us.<br><br>Relativity does not claim light would arrive everywhere instantly.<br><br>Secondly, the thing about light having mass is summarized very nicely in Einstein's famous formula:<br><br>E = mc²<br><br>Or in other words, energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.<br>Note however that mass is NOT independent of speed. The 'm' is the adjusted mass, because objects become heavier the faster they go. Light has mass because it moves at the speed of light. Any slower, and its mass would be zero (because its initial mass is also zero).<br>This is why light can be attracted by gravity. However it does not have a mass in the traditional sense, because there is no matter to contain it in.<br><br><br>Zevensoft, I get the idea that you think relativity is still some sort of magical fairy tale. Of course it still cannot explain everything in our universe, but no scientific theory has ever been 100% right from the beginning.<br><br>And you seem to forget the basis of science: to build a model that accurately predicts what we experience in the world. It can never be PROVEN that when I throw a ball, it will fly in a parabolic trajectory. But we slowly built a model to describe the things we see, and a ball that follows a parabolic trajectory fits very nicely in that model, so we assume it is correct.<br>When a model fits with all known observations, we can be pretty sure it's okay, but we can never be 100% sure.<br><br>Chemistry is one the areas where quantumphysics, mechanics and relativity have come together to form a new, accurate model of what happens on the atomic level and where classic theories often had to resort to 'tricks' to make things work.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zevensoft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th February 2003 09:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Meh it doesn't matter anyway, our lives are but a spark in the age of the universe, and the same goes for our understanding of it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zevensoft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th February 2003 09:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Oh and nice rebuttal by the way.<br><br>Another passing thought I just had, was that a fractal might be able to be used to transfer objects through different dimensional layers. But there are 2 problems with this theory I see already. One, it would take an infinite amount of work to build a fractal, and two, you need to be able to build in fractal dimensions in the first place. A chicken and the egg scenario. But then again, Big Bang anyone?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th February 2003 12:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">[QUOTE]<i>Originally posted by EnDurA</i><br><b>blacks holes aren't exactly a hole, if u stood on one you'd probobly be ripped in half by the gravatational difference between your legs and your head.

Take a look at a space time diagram for a black hole and it will look like an infinite abyss. And they are black to anyone outside of the event horizon, which would be us. And everything would eventually be sucked into it if it was the largest source of gravity in the universe, unless every thing was escaping from it at a certain escape velocity(which I know for any object behind the event horizon would be the speed of light). It is believed that thhis massive black hole is what is at the center of the universe.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaak</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th February 2003 14:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Erm?<br>My explanations are just too stupid to put them here (lack of english)...<br>...speak on, its very educative to listen U all.<br><br>My try to speak up in this topic was fool and stupid, just pecause I got none of those new fancy sience books...<br><br>Yup, its IMPOSSIBLE to travel at lightspeed (space=infinit and time=0 (for this abject) and this IS impossible)...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">legohead</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th February 2003 05:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hmmm... guess I was right about the post issue.
