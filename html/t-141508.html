It is hard to make an original preset, as there are tens of thousands of presets out there.<br><br>In my opinion, learning how to code SSC's and DM's is the best way to go with AVS. Basically everything else has been done before - there are some things left to do that would make good presets, but it becomes difficult. With SSC's and DM's you really get a hold on what the preset is doing. Coding these isn't too hard, but it may take some time to get started depending on what you know about coding and what math you're in. Good luck.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">horse-fly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th July 2003 06:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">actually, the preset doesn't have to be very complex at all, as some of my most original presets are actually quite basic.
