      <br />
      And da is much better than the forums or wa-dot-com will ever be, why? Because there is much more community spirit there.<br />
      <br />
      Winamp-dot-com? nobody ever comments the avs packs there...<br />
      forums? just a bunch of people post pumping and flaming each other and too much tech talk here, no wonder n00bs don't feel welcome when all they receive is a bunch of code lines in response.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Flow contest would be nice, You could only use 1 superscope &amp; 1 dynamic movement 1 effect list &amp; 1 trans effect of your choice... Then we would have a pack with some pretty fast flow presets that would run in high resolutions :)<br />

      and new pick 2 would result in an over FLOW of noob pres.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well my idea is that we would then have PROFFESIONAL n00b presets :p (sounds bit stupid eeh?) Anyone can make "cool" presets with load of effects, but what if the effects were limited? That requires skill to make them look good, not just "toss it up"...<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">I really like tugs idea. One scope, one effect list, one DM and lets say two trans effects, we want more than one decent preset tug. It would take a lot more skill to make that look better, and it might deter noobs if it's like that.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <b>scope, one effect list, one DM</b>
      </blockquote>i don't think we need a limit for buffers, it's not as if you can do much with them without more effects.

      <p class="post-content">Ok maybe not that much limited, but speed is the key here nevertheless. I think it would please a lot of people who think "AVS is slow &amp; crappy" :D<br />
      <br />
      Hmm... maybe...<br />
      <br />
      1 superscope<br />
      1 dynamic movement<br />
      2 effect lists<br />
      1 buffer save (with save)<br />
      1 buffer save (with restore)<br />
      2 trans effects (General APE's allowed, like colormap, texer, convolution)<br />
      <br />
      I think the presets would still work pretty fast if nobody goes over those limits, but of course if they don't use any GIANT superscopes or GIANT DM's with numpoints 10 000 and grid size 100x100 :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Good idea? I dunno :igor: Would be nice to see a pack full of simple presets made by the "AVS - elite" :p<br />
      <br />
      [EDIT]<br />
      One more thing, i think some effects could be "free" like fadeout since it really doesn't slow down the preset at all.<br />

      <p class="post-content">brightness sucks up quite a lot of fps when dealing with simple presets, maybe it's not so noticeable with the heavy effect presets, but it does suck up a load of fps. Fast brite also sucks fps up a bit, but i agree, it could be free too since it is pretty basic.</p>

      Flow preset contest<br />
      terms:<br />
      1: one superscope (can be replaced by any render object)<br />

      3: two effect lists<br />

      6: one other render object<br />
      7: any ammount of fadeout, brightness, fast brightness and all the misc except buffer.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't know about fadeout... It can be used as a very good render for flow presets... (See FF6 - Tuggummi - Smoothies)<br />
      Invert can also be used as that, though the beginning strobing would make the preset-viewing experience not-so-relaxing...<br />
      <br />
      I suggest that the submissions are e-mailed, with limit of submissions. Maybe limited updates? (Otherwise we'll copy the real-life model of beta-version releases of games... *shudders*)<br />
      For those that go over the limit, the latest update will be the one graded/voted on no matter what...<br />
      <br />
      I also suggest that contestants have 1 wildcard render/trans... Different people tend to have different specialties...<br />
      <br />
      We'll see how this contest grows out :)<br />
      <br />
      P.S. : Post the participating presets over DA too once the contest done in a pack ;)</p>

        Flow contest would be nice, You could only use 1 superscope &amp; 1 dynamic movement 1 effect list &amp; 1 trans effect of your choice... Then we would have a pack with some pretty fast flow presets that would run in high resolutions

      </blockquote>You sneaky bastard TUG ! I bet you've allready made an uber-133t-flow preset with exactly these components &amp; now try to do a contest which allows only those components you've listed. Am I right ;) ;) :blah:

      <p class="post-content">Well, here goes my view:<br />
      <br />
      I there are any restrictions in the number of ssc's or dm's and stuff, someone could write an entire APE to do his job! :) (although I doubt anyone would :D)<br />

      <p class="post-content">That what i would like:<br />
      <br />
      1: one render object<br />

      7: any ammount of fadeout, brightness, fast brightness and all the misc except buffer.<br />

      I used 1 dynamic movement, 1 convo filter, 1 color map, 2 effect lists, 2 buffers and 1 moving particle.<br />

      <p class="post-content">You people who say they get bad feelings about things are the people who never do anything because "it'll be shit". If it doesn't turn out to well so what, it's no major loss. We might as well try, if you don't like it don't get involved. That simple. If people think it's going to turn out bad then it'll turn out bad but if we just do it maybe, perhaps something might turn out well. You never know.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I checked out the presets submited so far and I was pleasently suprised , but I must say that almost all of them require some color work. My personal oppinion is that presets that include almost every color in the spectrum:) are a bit crappy(there are exceptions:)). Check out some of the better designed presets and you'll surely notice that they only have two or three colors in them (at a time). you will also notice this in advertiseing, package design....blablabla :D. So my advice is grab a book about colors (this Kuppers dude made the most valid color theory so far IMO)and read about harmonies or just check out your favorite drink, bublegum,... (note that the expenisve ones are usualy better designed:D) and try to use the colors you see there:).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reason i didn't suggest a poll is that people will vote for their own, that simple. It doesn't matter there is going to be some unfair votes cast. We need a better voting system than just forum members on a poll. Maybe UnConeD if he doesn't submit or appears sometime. Or rovastar. Don't choose people who don't know avs because they won't recognise the work put in etc. SOmeone with a bit of avs knowledge at least.</p>

      <p class="post-content">a couple questions: can you use a different render from the superscope, along with the "one extra render"? same with dm - can you use a different trans, e.g. dynamic shift or ddm?<br />
      also, can you submit multiple entries? i would assume you can...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think its one entry per person, and one update.. that was mentioned somewhere.. one entry it just plain logic for a competition, otherwise ppl could just send in 50 of their best flow presets.<br />
      <br />
      And no atero, dont stretch the rules because everyone else has already played by the rules so it would be unfair to redefine them.<br />
      <br />
      *It says "one render other than superscope", so you can only use one render other than superscope.<br />
      That means that you cant replace the superscope iwth another render.<br />
      You dont have to use a ssc, but then you still only have one render.<br />
      <br />
      *It says nothing about replacing the dm either, so you cant do it.<br />
      <br />
      *It is just logical to assume that you cant have a dm as one of your other trans if it has already mentioned one dm only.<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        4: unlimited number of buffers<br />
        7: any ammount of... all the misc except buffer.
      </blockquote>*yes that makes no sence at all, so just use as many buffers as you wish. it wont make much difference anyway.

      <p class="post-content">chill out and tell us what you find wrong with the rules. It would be a shame for you not to be a part of it simply because of what i said, especially after seeing the two presets you submited.<br />
      <br />
      The rules are the way they are because it is meant to be a competition was meant to be for simple, fast and flowey presets.<br />
      so, tell us whats wrong with 'em<br />

      <p class="post-content">:), i like that idea.. but radio rules say that it should go last to first, that way people will stick around untill the end of the pack :D<br />

      <p class="post-content">no way, your preset is nice. Especially the colors. Not many presets use beige/kharke/cream or whatever you want to call it :)<br />

      just because i said i dropped out of the contest doesn't mean i actually did...<br />
      <br />
      i already made two presets, and they'd both be going to waste if i didn't enter one (fingerpaint, of course, because trefoil violates phaze's precious rules) :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">In order from best to worst.If someone thinks his preset should have higher up, and starts bitching about that, it won't help him/her. I won't change the order.<br />
      <br />
      1. Stardust - Military. No, I didn't pick her preset because we're both from Croatia, it has great colors, nice FX, and great beat detection.<br />
      2. Shock Value - Chrome Current<br />
      3. Tuggummi - Odour Control<br />
      4. Unconed - Daedalus (If it's in :) )<br />
      5. Shreyas - Recall The Old Memories<br />
      6. Ishan Rocky - Curves &amp; Colours<br />
      7. Nixa - Another Flow Preset<br />
      8. Magic - Organic Tunnel<br />
      9. Raz - ? (He didn't name the preset AFAIK)<br />
      10. Runar - (-)Ion<br />
      11. Siddharta - The Gloaming (would have been higher if he didn't used a scope or something instead of the pic)<br />
      12. Super Toast - Frosty Oxide<br />
      13. Undefined - Hypnotism<br />
      14. Atero - Fingerpaint<br />
      15. Hungryskull - Jiggly Stuff<br />
      16. mquadrat - Vector Flow<br />
      <br />
      Those are the presets I got from the other thread, and I would appriciate if someone pointed to me where the other 8 presets are.<br />
      Again, if you think you've been cheated Eurosong-style, don't bitch too much. You CAN write a nice polite post though.<br />
      <br />
      Reviewed while listening to:<br />
      Siddharta - Klinik (a Slovenian band, not the avser :) )<br />
      Die Toten Hosen - Schön Sein<br />
      Nightwish - Stargazers<br />
      Apocalyptica feat. Sandra Nasic - Path vol.2<br />
      Members Of Mayday - Soundtropolis<br />
      Negrocan - Cadavez<br />
      Nick Cave - Babe I'm On Fire<br />
      and the CD2 of the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack (original CD, it was playing in the other room).<br />
      PS. Amazing what shuffle can bring.</p>

      <p class="post-content">wow, good point atero, i didnt even notice that because they are clear screens.. Because we didnt pick it up until now, i think it would be very mean to say he cant use it, so i vote we do what atero sais, and that means atero could use his other one, but no other exceptions. If atero does do this, DD wil have to rethink his choices. Anyone against this?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, ok, everyone calm down..<br />
      <br />
      I said that that was only my opinion. Now that I look again at the presets, I would probably put Siddharta's preset a bit above, but I was kinda annoyed when I had to unzip the preset and the pic in the different folders. And yes, I know it's a stupid reason, and I'm sorry, but we judges still have to decide the final order, and the preset will probably go up.<br />
      First you guys must decide what to do with raz's preset. And I bet, if you allow Atero's rulesbreaking preset to enter the contest, there will be somebody else who will want to modify his preset if Atero's could enter the contest, etc, etc.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's either the way it is with the clear screen or a same colour one dot in the center scope and a blended d=0; movement, that wouldn't violate any rules but somehow, i think the clear screen is way faster and it has the exact same effect so i think you can just let it slide.</p>

      - Nice idea &amp; nice jiggly dm.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      As you can notice, i didn't include my own preset in my list as well as i didn't include Magic's, UnConeD's or Raz's. Also i only "reviewed" one of Atero's presets (because 1 was the limit, no matter how much you hate that fact Atero :p)<br />
      <br />
      For not including Magic's &amp; Raz's presets i have to say that they didn't actually strike me as "flow" presets, while magic's preset did had a flow "texture" it didn't look quite like your standard flow preset. And Raz's preset looked more of a static pattern with a dm rather than a flow preset (it didn't even leave any "trails")<br />
      <br />
      While UnConeD's preset basicly "qualifies" in what i believe flow presets are (a render which leaves "trails" which are adjusted&amp;shifted&amp;morphed with trans effect(s)), i didn't include it, because it didn't look flowy.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, im not a reviewer so this is just my personal statement about the presets, my own personal &amp; humble opinion :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reason i did this is because it would stand out from all the other boring flow presets that you see everywhere. It flows around and morphs instead of a typical mediocre swirling around and leaving a trail type boring crap. I am so sorry for breaking the theme a little and trying not to release a pack full of the same presets.</p>

      Maybe another contest after we get the pack together and the "real" reviews about the presets, with no limits, let's just see who's the best or something :blah: If that's what you want?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Except one minor thing. It's not fucking diluting, it's flowing. Flowing is smooth movement, mine moves smoothly. Great job you shrubs, you all made the same preset. The only reason i didn't submit a flow preset like the rest of you is because it's so fucking boring watching the same old preset go by. When you do a contest you shouldn't be so anal about the title because you'll end up with the same preset over and over. You want that then fine, don't accept it. Fuck it and you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">c'mon, i think all of the flowy presets are different enough in their own rights.. mosdt of them are reasonably new looking.<br />
      <br />
      This competition HAS tought us alot: no matter how tight our little group may seem, we are bound to bicker and bicker endlessly over shit-all! Next time, we get someone else, not from here (maybe rovastar or someone) to create the rules, and get judges from somewhere else.<br />
      <br />
      Im all for doing another contest, though i think some restrictions are neccessary: its impossible to judge what is "the best all round preset". think about it, what if tuggummi produces some ground breaking amazing looking thing like he always does, and UnConeD makes a ground breaking new code idea like a pig dancing infront of a mirror on a voxel landscape under a fractle sky in 4-D. Then what will we do....Well, id like to see that pig, but i dont know which ide vote for.<br />
      <br />
      I'm happy with the way the comp has turned out... we have some nice presets in there. Including the ones that may or may not be defined as 'flowy'. I dont think that presets should be excluded because they dont flow enough, just they wont win. Flow should be a criteria in judging, along with speed, aesthetica and the rest.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would really like to see just the dancing pig in 4-D, that would be really cool. Another thing I noticed is that most of the disagreements about this whole contest have been based on "poor-wording" of rules and/or mis-interrpretation of the same a few words.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So it should've been a diluting contest then, although most people (like myself) don't even know what the fuck it means :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I kinda agree with siddharta here if anyone wants to make another contest, there must be somekind of limits or rules... otherwise it just gets messy when it comes putting them in the winning order... unless we have a poll an like atleast 100 voters then it would be pretty fair... But we don't HAVE 100 VOTERS, do we? :igor:<br />
      <br />
      If rules: They all look the same...<br />
      If not rules: Not enough voters...<br />

I say we have another contest where all you're given is a title, judgeing criteria can be, creativity with the title, FPS, and yadda yadda the rest of the regular criteria, no limit to what components you can use, but FPS will be a judging criteria. Then we won't have all these problems.</p>

      <font size="3">Speed - One which looks OK, but runs really good.</font><br />

      3rd. nixa - another flow preset: Runs well, but the colours are a bit harsh.<br />

      <br />
      Anyway, how 'bout making the rating-system from 1-16 (was there more than 16 entries? ),so that you can use each number ONLY once (putting presets in to order from worst to best in another words) when this is done, I PM my numbers to doggydog &amp; zevensoft, doggydog PMs his to me &amp; Zeven and so on.. When some of the judges haves the numbers he publishes the results here and other judges agrees / disagrees..<br />

      <p class="post-content">you forget to soon shreyas:p Like raz said before-"Everyone will vote for their own presets".There should not be any poll.<br />
      Anyway i've had too much of this , i mean does'nt it sound crazy?? <b>the contestants themselves are discussing how the result should be decided?</b><br />
      No offense , but this should have been decided before.</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      Name: points: misc:<br />
      ---------------------------<br />
      <b>Hungryskull</b> 1 uhm...<br />
      <br />
      <b>Super Toast</b> 2 ugly &amp; empty<br />
      <br />
      <b>Ishan</b> 3 not too flowy, quite static<br />
      <br />
      <b>Raz</b> 4 um...flow ??<br />
      <br />
      <b>Runar</b> 5 too static &amp; gets boring after awhile<br />
      <br />
      <b>Nixa</b> 6 Ugly colors<br />
      <br />
      <b>Undenifed</b> 7 this have been made like million times<br />
      <br />
      <b>Tuggummi</b> 8 Good base but it's missing good colors and something..<br />
      <br />
      <b>Shreyas</b> 9 Good response &amp; I really like the dot design, some not so good movements in multimov dynamove<br />
      <br />
      <b>Siddharta</b> 10 Good dynamove, colors needs fixing<br />
      <br />
      <b>Magic</b> 11 Neat but needs more beatresponse..<br />
      <br />
      <b>Stardust</b> 12 Good colors, good fps<br />
      <br />
      <b>UnConeD</b> 13 I'm loving the scope here. Really nice colors as well , but not exactly a "flow" preset if you ask me..<br />
      <br />
      <b>Atero</b> 14 Nice flow, sweet colors, dynmove is also quite nice<br />
      <br />
      <b>Mquadrat</b> 15 Really responsive, good flow<br />
      <br />
      <b>Shock Value</b> 16 Even though, I don't have the 'addborders' ape this looks really good. Good fps rate &amp; looks absolutly awesome in hi-res fullscreen mode</p>

      <br />
      Super_toast - 1 - dark and kinda ugly , could have been better with a FB and a morphing scope.<br />
      <br />
      Hungryskull - 2 - its pretty ugly dude,i think that superscope is in pain!<br />
      <br />
      Ishan Rocky - 3 - this aint too bad,but its sooo damn bright that it ruins the preset and i do not see the flow.<br />
      <br />
      Unconed - 4 - yeah, it is great über super but...i have tried pretty hard to notice the flow,seems like it is lost somwhere.<br />
      <br />
      Nixa - 5 - kinky DM with sweet beat detection,but,DAMN!,the colors stink.<br />
      <br />
      Undefined - 6 - well,i like it but i hope the better version is a little more colored and with a nicer DM(yes,i know i`ve already seen it but these guys dont know that).<br />
      <br />
      Runar - 7 - great effect,but it is dull and...colorless<br />
      <br />
      Mquadrat - 8 - its kinda empty..something is missing.<br />
      <br />
      Magic - 9 - cool tunnel,looks sweet but it needs to be more flowy.<br />
      <br />
      Raz - 10 - this is FLOWY,like a river,but there are too many colors and it ruins the aspect a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Siddhartha - 11 - spooky,good FPS rate and great beat detection.<br />
      <br />
      Shreyas - 12 - cool preset,good colors!<br />
      <br />
      Stardust - 13 - great looking,the d=-d movement goes great in here!<br />
      <br />
      Tuggummi - 14 - i love this!!!!! I dont know why,but its sooooper !<br />
      <br />
      Atero - 15 - great looking preset,but the beat detection sux a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Shock Value - 16 - OK. You are the WINNER d00d! Best DM , best FPS rate , best colors , best preset. Congrats :D<br />
      <br />
      I believe this was quite an objective and clear review.Lets wait for doggy and zevensoft to give points and see who won... We already know I won but lets make it official :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Its quite simple. Read the review he gave 2 pages ago. He devided the ranking into multiple categorys, selected the best 3 ones gave em 5 to 3 points (and others that were worth mentioning +1). So whats the matter about this? I prefere this form of rating.<br />
      <br />
      Btw, i personally don't care about who's won or not. It was a nice experience to do a preset having limitations so you're forced to optimize your code.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Im rethinking about that pack... I mean i am putting it into my next pack, so there isn't any sense adding it to a flow contest pack... besides im getting the feeling that no one is sure about the "winning order" or no one is ready to pimp the pack up, do the screenshots etc...<br />

      </blockquote>right fair enough.. but

      <blockquote>
        Bottom -&gt; Top ordered PLEASE!
      </blockquote>'m afraid youll have to pick one or the other, Zevs rating system only counted a cpecific number of places, so we cant give everyone a prize..<br />
      <br />
      I think Doggy's right, we should just finish this whol thing.<br />
      Here are what i have got for the top 4 based one simply averaging a unified points system from the placings that the judges gave (4 for first, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd, 1 for 4th, and zero for the rest)<br />
      Dont worry about that system, it works out just as fair, trust me.<br />
      <br />
      OK: heres what I got:<br />
      <br />
      <b>1st! Shack value (Two firsts and a second, 11pts)<br />
      2nd. Stardust (a first and a fourth, 5 pts )<br />
      3rd. Tugg (two thirds, 4 pts)<br />
      4th. Unconed (two forths 2 pts)</b><br />
      <br />
      hopefully people wll agree with this... and we can move on..<br />
      (for the love of god please)
