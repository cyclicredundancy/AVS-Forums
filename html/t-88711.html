      At long last, the first AVS presets pack from yours truly has arrived. Thanks for being patient, everyone. Your reward is 30 (count 'em) of my first mass-released works.<br />
      <br />
      Reviews/opinions are always welcome and definitely encouraged. And don't forget to read readme.txt. By the way, the next pack will be called uNDefined 2 - Advantage, if you're wondering.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey man, pretty nice stuff in there. You were right about the oldschool thing. You should check your superscopes though. I'm sure some of them don't need 1000+ points.<br />
      <br />
      You might want to try experimenting with more dynamic stuff. (actually, so should I, I'm in a rut here). You can do some nifty stuff with it.<br />
      <br />
      One last thing. You can make you readme.txt popup after the install. Here's how I did it in the nsis script<br />
      <font color="blue"><br />
      Exec '"$WINDIR\notepad.exe" $INSTDIR\rucksack\readme.txt'<br /></font></p>

      <p class="post-content">I've made a slight amendment to the readme, it now includes the correct URL which I just registered. :p<br />

      If you've got the original pack, it's <a href="http://winamp-undefined.cjb.net/" target="_blank">http://winamp-undefined.cjb.net/</a><br />

      <p class="post-content">Well...if you want a review...<br />
      Aesthetics: 2.5 stars<br />
      Originality: 1.5 stars<br />
      Writing: 3<br />
      Code: 2<br />
      Overall: 2.5 stars<br />
      <br />
      You could've done something really cool with the ideas in Twisting, but...you didn't.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just what do you mean by writing? Do you mean I commented my presets well? :p<br />
      <br />
      And yeah, I was thinking about doing something else based on the Twisting movement. Thanks for reminding me.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the review Atero. Bit pissed off 'bout originality though, considering someone else commended me for that when I released the preview. :( But that's life. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have to agree with Atero on the originality factor... remember that it's not about what you come up with yourself, but what you come up with yourself that hasn't been done before.<br />
      <br />
      Only two or three presets made me go "heh... nice". And some of the colours are um... 'special' too. Still a few coding errors too: a Replace/Replace effect list can be left out (unless it's enabled onbeat), and in one preset you multiply 'r' by pi: r is already in the range (0...6.28), so you probably want to use a whole number.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and I don't know what kind of marihuana you or your friends have been smoking, but it does *not* look anything like 'Trippin': marihuana does not cause visual hallucinations. It's classified as hallucinogenic because it slightly distorts your perception of time. For swirly, floating smurfs you'd need to use magic mushrooms or LSD (a lot more dangerous than pot).</p>

      <br />
      About the r*pi thing, yeah that was in Power Core. I changed it to tan(r) and played around with a subsitute value, but nothing actually matched what I wanted.<br />
      <br />
      And the Trippin' thing, well...I'm excused 'cause I haven't tried dumbass substances (like I actually said in the comment). I just looked at it and thought of some stoned teenager stumbling down the street going "whooooaaaaa".<br />
      <br />
      One more thing, thanks for not slamming on the piece of crap that is the movement in Fierce Lens Flare. :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, thanks to you too UC, constructive criticism is always appreciated. :) (Just what presets were those that you liked?)</p>
