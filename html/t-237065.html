      Hey, i've decided to post my first pack on here so you guys/gals can see if i'm any good at making presets.<br />
      I think that i have few good presets and maybe some crappy ones but whatever.<br />
      i've also included some other presets that I havent put int the pack yet.<br />
      I would really like to have some feed back on my work and if you want you can remix one or two or five... just let me see it.<br />
      I know i need a new intro and that tunel of the light is wrong (ish) but i corrected it and it looked crap.<br />
      Yep, that will do for now.</p>

      <br />
      <b>On My Beach</b>: Pretty cool (reminds me a preset made by PAK-9, Beanies), but least stuffs in it. Should be added more, btw it's great~<br />

      <p class="post-content">Not bad for the first pack I have seen from you... Some of the stuff is really awesome too imo. e.g. the pong game :)<br />
      <br />
      There is also some terrible noob shit in here too :P<br />
      <br />
      Some tips:<br />
      <br />
      1.) El-vis code does some cool stuff, but its usually a bit lazy and inefficient, better to steal from someone more recent for 3d code.<br />
      <br />
      2.) Your 'torus' is interesting, however, I am the torus king:<br />
      <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2809465/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2809465/</a><br />
      <br />
      3.) Keep creating! You rock so far :)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      EDIT: Feel free to ask any avs/graphics related questions, I and the others here understand pretty much everything which has ever been done in AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah i second jheriko<br />
      and i have corrected your torus code<br />
      and i added aspect ratio correction.<br />
      glancing at code i see that youre coding inefficient.<br />
      keep in mind that a multiplication is much faster than a division so try to replace something like:<br />
      vara=varb/varc;<br />
      vard=vare/varc;<br />
      varf=varg/varc;<br />
      <br />
      with:<br />
      invarc=1/varc;<br />
      vara=varb*invarc;<br />
      vard=vare*invarc;<br />
      varf=varg*invarc;</p>

      I found "On My Beach" quite interesting, but perhaps you should add some more details to it like clouds or some common beach utensils. <font size="1">(btw: somehow it reminded me a bit of Pak's "Beanies" preset ;) )</font></p>

      The n00b shite is being weeded out and will be gone in a week or two (if I put my mind to work)<br />
      The thing with 'On my beach' is that I made it before I saw beanies (I hadn't downloaded any new avs packs for a while :))<br />

      <br />
      I can see the headlines now.<br />
      <br />
      Well its about 100 times better than the average noob pack, on my beach is fun and Torus is fairly stylish (ignore the preset nazi's with rods up their tori).<br />
      <br />
      Be careful using too much text and interactivity, text in presets gets very irritating on re-watching. Interactivity is only worth putting in if it adds a significant dimension to the preset, rather than just being able to pick a stationary light position or invert the colours.<br />
      <br />
      Some other people have mentioned the noobier parts, which im sure u are aware of. Good first effort, keep learning and enjoy.<br />
      <br />
      P.S. Keep learning the code too... a preset's awesomeness is directly proportional to how much code is in it<br />

      Honestly, code isn't everything. Of course, you should always know how to handle the tools you're working with (and i'm not talking about the built-in effects btw), but since AVS'ing is also a kind of art you have to care for the esthetical aspects like color-schemes, style etc as well.

      <p class="post-content">You should definitely learn how to (correctly) make your code framerate independent! Your first preset is so fast, i can't really see what it's supposed to be. It just flashes randomly. The other two presets are also running way too fast on my machine (even though a bit slower).<br />
      <br />
      So, i'd suggest "UHFROD 1-3" (Ultra High Frequenzy Rotor Of Doom) for their names. :p</p>
