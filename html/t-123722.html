I've got a psuedo-explanation of 3D in AVS Primer, it doesn't work in the real world (the proof, that is), but for all intents and purposes, it'll suffice (I'm gonna update it soon).<br>An object mirrored along the X-plane works like this:<br>frame: a=0;<br>pixel:<br>a=1-a;<br>x=if(a,...,-x);<br>y=if(a,...,y);<br>You can apply this to 3D quite easily.

(For superscopes anyway) its not going to be in the forums.. The forums will have ideas like rotating the flat surface, or rotatingg a surface with DM.

(ax+by+cz+d=0)<br><br>Is that what you want to do? If so then the easiest way to do this is to rotate and translate your 'world' so that the plane is z=0 then just change the signs the resulting z co-ordinates and reverse the rotation and translation. It will take a maximum of two rotations and one translation to align the plane with z=0 since the rotations and translation should be done to remove the x component, then the y component then the constant value. Do some matrix multiplication by a general plane to figure this out...
