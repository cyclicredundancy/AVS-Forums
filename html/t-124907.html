      It has been booring here lately, so I post one preset on what im working...<br />
      The colour effect is nice and if to work bit more on this preset, it might come up pretty cool (i think so), but right now its half done...<br />
      Suggestions? Ideas? All are welcome...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Its not that hard to make stuff look good, it looks pretty good it just needs work is all, i still dont like the colours very much :p but this looks pretty sweet, i (finally) got around to making a cube, this is what i did with it, i think it looks pretty good. btw i know the shadow is crappy and not correct, well probably anyway ll i did was shift the scope by 0.2 points, meh, stll looks good</p>

      <p class="post-content">now that looks nice, very very nice. It looks all electricy and good now, the colours fit well with it now, and after all my whinging ;) i would make it so the box thingys go until the vanishing point when straight on and off the screen when not and have the oscilliscopey thingy all the way through it, very nice job :up: my cube code probably needs optimising, still, its a cube. Plus my codes nice and easy to read like that for me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sweet momma :) It looks great but it really needs a background.And modifying the distance could make it look better IMO.Oh and that shadow effect is cool.And and and blah...Its a good preset :)<br />

      PS. z1=if(equal(a,1),0.2,z1);<br />
      y1=if(equal(a,2),0.2,y1);<br />
      x1=if(equal(a,3),-0.2,x1); and the others -&gt; those equations create the cube right ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah im gonna work on the morphing when i get the time, right now all it is is a bit of z2 multiplied by one of the getosc thingys i used for the rotation.<br />
      <br />
      As for the FPS its running exceptionally high for my computer, most of my presets run at about 11/12 on my computer and this is running at about 27/28, i dont know, maybe change of music or something.<br />
      <br />
      and distance, yeah blah blah ill work on it when i get time. busy busy lazy busy b me at the moment. 3 months before GCSEs and im behind on coursework and and and, you get the idea :igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">You could probably reduce the number of ifs in there which should speed it up.<br />
      <br />
      You rotation looks a tad wonky to me, and you'd get less distortion as the points move farther from the viewing plane if you multiplied by the inverse of z.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah i thought the rotation looked a bit dodgy at first but with the distortion i didnt notice it. I prefer using all the ifs to using the bor function. i didnt like that method, i thought the if one was much easier.<br />

      As for the posting, yeah i do but... erm... yeah :rolleyes:<br />
      Morphing needs work i think ill do that now actaully<br />
      Oh yeah phaze graphics cards dont affect FPS, its all processor based.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The movement seems very repetitive. Try something a little more random. The background also makes it harder to see the actual SSC as it takes away all of the focus on the SSC. It's a nice effect, but more of a preset of it's own than a background.</p>
