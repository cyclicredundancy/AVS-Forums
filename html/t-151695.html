      Some AVS show close message. why?<br />
      Is that because of very heavy DM's &amp; SS's or something else?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Right is is a difficult situation.<br />
      <br />
      A) I will not have flaming here. You know that is out of order you lot do not need to be told this. Comments like 'I wish you die' are extreme in every respect. I don't care for what mitigating circumstances there are stop doing this or you will be teh one getting the warning.<br />
      <br />
      Is ignoring sooo difficult. *shrug* :confused:<br />
      <br />
      B) shabaviz55, PLease think before you write. I know english is not your first langauge but when no-one can understand what you are talking about with topics like this. MAybe post packs of presest rather than every preset has a thread people will love you more if you post less.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sorry Shabaviz55 and Rovastar, I will take back my words. You're right, I was out of line, but it's just so fucking annoying sometimes. I indeed wish to apologize to Shabaviz, for he has his ups and downs. He asks a lot of annoying shit, posts a lot of annoying posts, though is very friendly in the presets forum every now and then. I guess you just have to learn.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry mate, I didn't mean it that harsh, I hope you accept my apologies. The annoyance just started to get me. I really hope you can forgive me.<br />
      <br />
      Me feels sorry.</p>
