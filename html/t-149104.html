Triple hura for all the new UIs. May I ask why is it better if beat and frame blocks are switched?. And Init could be executed on sizechange in all all components IMHO, or even better the 'main' could have an 'on resize' block.<br><br>The SSC bug I was talkin about on the other thread is in fact an overlay bug.For some reason the color chanells don't align right!? You can see this as ugly stuff on borders between colors. This is a real pain in the ass when I project AVS in clubs, since overlay is the only way to do it and still have the editor open. Im not sure this doesnt only happen on my computer.<br>I noticed one on the SSC too (if the line goes offscreen on the bottom or right side it doesnt draw the last line of pixels on the bottom or right side).<br>I attached a preset that shows these two bugs and the text one.<br>Another very anoying one is the main list not showing everything in correct order all the time.<br><br>And two things that would realy kick ass:<br>codable linewidth - a realy usefull one IMO<br>antialiseing - a major SSC cosmetic fix (now all SSC stuff is either blured beyond recognition or jagged as hell:D + a lot of my presets look ugly :cry: )<br><br>Enough whineing:), 2.7 version kicks lammas balls, Im still trying to contemplate how all the new stuff will effect presets from here on. Looking forward to W5 and the first packs.<br><br>edit&gt; just read a post by unconed in the other thread(dunno how I missed it last time). He sais that overlay thing isnt a bug at all and that it's suposed to be that way :cry:.
