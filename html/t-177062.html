      Well, I still suck at making presets but I'm learning. Here are 3 of my latest ones. The energy tunnel is just like a wormhole, it's prety crazy. The normal one is kind of plain but I don't know how to make it look better. The strobe version of it looks pretty cool I think. It's hard for your eyes to follow it but when you see the tunnel it looks pretty cool. The Eye was an accident but I thought it was interesting so I saved it. Take a look and e-mail me or post any suggestions you have.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Don't really like the strobed version, but really you do not suck at all, these presets may be a bit empty, but they look great.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, they are kind of plain at times because I don't know how to do very many things, most of what I learn is through experimentation. I'm glad they at least look good to people other than myself :) . Originally my goal was to make a wormhole preset but the image in my head is extremely hard for me to create in AVS. I've been reading a book on C++ so that helps me understand the code a little better but I still have trouble thinking of what needs to be done to get the exact look I'm going for. The first energy tunnel is the closest I've come so far. I'm trying to figure out how I can get the lines to be connected by color so it looks like a tube without changing the background color completely like in the strobe version. I also wrote my own color changing thingy so it would switch between red, green, and blue but only on beat. It works fine in terms of changing the color but I can't get it to change the color of both superscopes together so it doesn't look right. Both of them need to be the same color for the tunnel to look right and since I have it pick a random color, it doesn't work out. I tried that color modifier thing too but that only changed the background color and made it look worse. I'm happy I at least got the tunnel to take shape and move like I wanted it to. I asked UnConeD to make a wormhole preset because I know he can do really complicated stuff but it didn't quite match what I was looking for. Rather than bug him about it, I decided to just try to do it myself since only I can see the image in my head. It'll take time but eventually I should be able to get it right. When I make enough progress with it I'll post it again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm try an additive or maximum blend between the foreground and a background</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can't get the color to change on anything but the background so I'm just gonna leave it that way for now. Here's a version of the energy tunnel with my color changing code and now it looks more like you're traveling through it. You can't really see a tube like you can in the first energy tunnel but it does look like you're inside one. That's the only way the color will look like part of the tunnel itself. There are stars in the background too so the tunnel is sort of transparent I guess. Take a look.</p>
