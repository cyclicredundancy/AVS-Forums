      While listening to some techno I thought it would be a good idea to have a wormhole preset to watch in AVS so I started looking into them and trying to learn how to make them. Well, since I'm still a high school student in geometry the math required for this stuff isn't really there so, needless to say, I can't really do much of anything on my own. I e-mailed UnConeD about it since he's awesome at this stuff and he sent me one of his packs with a wormhole preset included. It looked pretty cool but I was imagining something faster and with a slightly different look to it so I modified his preset a little bit and came up with what I attached here. Basically I just changed a few numbers, one setting, and some colors to do this but it makes a difference in overall appearance and speed. Just thought I'd share it with any others that aren't capable of doing this and were looking for this kind of preset. Enjoy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">a pretty ok remix, nothing special, but keep it up.<br />
      <br />
      Btw, the wormhole idea is actually very averdone in avs. Nearly every artist has made one from time to time.<br />
      <br />
      two of my favs:<br />
      <br />
      fsk - "molehole" from "pickin dim 3"<br />
      jheriko - "time trials"</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice to see that you are working on things, but I don't like the preset. It is basicly just a rehash, and a pretty bad rehash at that, of a mathatmacly(sp) advanced and amazing preset.<br />
      First advice-Aim smaller-for your first presets you shouldn't go try diggin into the coding of things like 3D scopes, advanced raytraced DMs, etc.. But start smaller and work up. An analogy would be trying to build a pyramid without bulilding the ocean, you need a solid ground to work on. (I know that is probably not that good of an anology but it worked in my head). Instead what you should do is read up on things like FSK's AVS tutorial, Atero's AVS Primer, and just search the fourms to learn new things.<br />
      Second Advice- Being a highschool student doesn't mean anything. I myself am in 10th grade and taking Honors Algerbra 2 in school, and last year failing honors geometry. A good quote would be from mark twain, (or I think it's his), "I never let schooling get in the way of my education." What I am doing, I am learning precalc, calc, and some forms of discreet math from onling sites, and I am also reading as many things as I can to learn more oustide of school.<br />
      Main advice-It's not shamefull to start out with n00b presets, everyone had to start somewere, (except maybe UnConeD, but he is not normal), so start small and work your way up.</p>
