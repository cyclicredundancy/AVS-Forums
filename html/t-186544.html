      APE's<br />
      i just want o confirm something<br />
      <br />
      APE's are rather plugins for AVS rather than direct winamp plugins right?<br />
      <br />
      does anybody know hwere a list of released APE's is?<br />
      <br />
      they allow you to interfere with the actual framebuffer and modify it right?<br />
      <br />
      i am plannign to make a couple of APE's.. one that inports visualations from a third party program (running concurrently) and blends it into the aps visualisation..<br />
      and another that does the opposite..<br />
      <br />
      just wondering where to start.</p>

      An APE is basically a .dll renamed to .ape<br />

      just link to the author's page or to the download page of the specific ape<br />
      if the author changes the download urls and sets value on having his newest apes on that site, he/she sends a mail to you and you change it...<br />

      <p class="post-content">The thing is, I plan to make this a site for beginners, where they can just download all the APE's they want without having to trawl through a load of different download pages and forum topics. Anyway, the site was just gonna be a basic 5-column table, with the name of the APE, with a download link, name of the creator, with a link to his page, version number, file size and a link to a sperate description of the APE (either written by the author or me) and a couple of screenshots. So, as UnConed is a mod here, I'm asking him if I could post the APE's on the page, if I keep them as up to date as I possibly can by myself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm sorry I really really love the FAQ and if you can't be arsed to use a FAQ on a forum then you should be shot. There exists a list, it is a bit rubbish like you say, so what I think (know) might (will) be a great idea is to stick a link to this site on the end of the APE faq entry.<br />

      </blockquote>Why not use a direct link to acko.net (only example i can think of) or whatever site the ape is hosted on by the author... then you won't have to update them yourself.. you save webspace and you won't have to struggle to try to find an actual reason to do it in that awkward way. It won't mean that users will have to trawl through a million download pages etc....<br />
      <br />
      btw multi filter will never be updated (much to my annoyance) due to lack of a source code for it, since I wiped my comp since then (not by choice). So I don't mind if you stick that one up on your site.
