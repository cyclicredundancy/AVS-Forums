First of all a sincere apology to all those who have submitted a pack in the last couple of weeks (months?).<br><br>As some know, I've had major problems. I (for reasons unknown) didn't get a dorm room (free net) in Zagreb this year, and had to get a room at an appartment. I only got DSL there today (after 10 days or so of waiting).<br><br>Before that I was ill for quite long and busy with my exams when I wasn't (and when I was actually). I couldn't leave my house in Split because of that, and as you know, I only have a 56k modem there, and the modem connection only worked on my old Celeron 300A, on which I couldn't rate presets fairly (wouldn't work on my new pc).<br><br>All in all, that's behind me.

I hope this clears up the synchronization theory. if i sound wrong in any area i appologise i'm wirting this on a time limit.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
