      Some <a href="http://xbox.ign.com/articles/401/401793p1.html" target="_blank">interesting news</a> from E3 regarding a possible new visualisation program for the X-Box.<br />
      <br />
      I'm hoping desperately that it (the visualisation) won't utterly suck, though given the dismal effort of their original visualisation, I don't know that I hold out a lot of hope for it....<br />
      <br />
      If only we could see AVS or MilkDrop on an X-Box.. or even something better. Oh well, we can always hope...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Some snippets:<br />
      <br />
      Seems like the focus is not just visualisation:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Music Mixer allows gamers to upload digital pics and videos from the PC to their Xbox hard drive so tat they can create their own virtual slideshow.<br />
        <br />
        2D visual shows can include music(and any MP3 can be ripped from PC to Xbox now) and any number of digital images. Digital media can be easily customized with Music Mixer and a bevy of effects, including wipes and fades, can be implemented to make for the coolest slideshow presentation ever imagined.
      </blockquote>I guess this is for the more traditonal non-raving folks who would freak out at seeing psychedelic animations ;).<br />
      <br />
      Also, this is weird:<br />

      <blockquote>
        The software includes over 10 hours of visual media,
      </blockquote>but then it says:<br />

      <blockquote>
        Video can also be implemented (there's about an hour and a half of canned video included with Music Mixer) to enhance the experience
      </blockquote>What kind of non-video visual media is those 8.5 hours then? Or do they mean that there is 1.5 hour of actual real-life video and the rest is computer generated?<br />
      <br />
      It also seems it will be very WildTangent-ish:<br />

      <blockquote>
        But, perhaps cooler, is that the 3D visualization creates virtual raves dancing to the music ripped to your Xbox hard drive. Set the number of dancers, clothing, and ratio of males to females.
      </blockquote>So far, it sounds like an interesting product for most people, but not a visualisation walhalla. The only thing that makes me curious is this:<br />

      <blockquote>
        Pics can be used to enhance the audio experience, or mixers can forego digital pictures all-together and create their own sensory output, manipulating the visuals in real-time with both thumbsticks.
      </blockquote>What exactly do they mean with 'create their own sensory output'? Having a limited milkdrop/avs clone that allows joystick input would be cool, but it's not really explained what it is.

      <p class="post-content">bite me phaze. nullsoft needs to get their priorities straight. we've been waiting for a REAL update to avs for how long now? a year or so perhaps? and here they're wasting their time "widening" their marked to xboxers. fuck that, if they want to get a bigger userbase then they should get their asses in motion over macamp again.<br />
      <br />
      as for updating avs ourselves, search the fucking forums. how the hell are WE going to update it? it's not open source, the interface is fairly comlicated (and we're looking to make it more so), and there's only one of us who really knows about all of the effects/how to recreate them, and that's unconed.<br />
      <br />
      so until you're ready and willing to actually do something instead of whining about how none of us are, i suggest you shut the fuck up, got it? :mad:</p>

      <p class="post-content">WTF is wrong with you atero ? I know the threads in which everyone complains(including me) about how the AVS community is ignored.So shut the fuck up and stop acting like a 5 year old molested child.Oh and how can we update avs ? Well,usually,normal people have friends.What if those friends know a lot of programming and have the required knowledge ? I thought you were smarter and mature but by judging from your attitude and behaviour you act like a small child who didnt eat any candy today.Its so easy to change your opinion about people... :(<br />
      Oh and hungryskull,nice to see you awake...Nullsoft should have done this a long time ago but since you cant make money from AVS i believe its at the bottom of the list.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Phaze, maybe it's just me, but i wouldn't want anyone to meddle with something i use a lot who doesn't give a fuck about it... Your programmer friend most likely won't give a fuck if they aren't AVS artists themselves.<br />
      <br />
      But this is pointless, AVS isn't opensource, and i thank god for that! What we really don't need here is 20 different versions of AVS running around the net. Just imagine: "This AVS pack has been made with AVS version 2.85C by ThIsGuY2k , you need the AVS version 2.85C by ThIsGuY2k to run the presets!"</p>

      </blockquote>Seriously, what are you on. The XBox has a CELERON II RUNNING AT 733MHZ!!! That's slower than my computer, and mine has (literally) 10x the memory. And I still get around 15fps in AVS @ 320x240. The only thing that can process AVS at high enough speeds is a parallel processing computer, like the GSCube or Pixar's Renderfarm.

      It doesn't actually say anything specifically about AVS, I just thought that you guys might be interested in it.... it would probably have to rely on the graphics card like MD does, as far as I know it has a GF3Ti-equivalent in the machine.<br />

      <br />
      I'm just hoping that they can come up with something better than their lame Winamp plugins... I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with that. Hopefully it will be possible to use presets or something like that for their visualisations. It's supposed to be released in September, so we'll see how it turns out.<br />

      It is a shame that they do not know how to write decent vis software. :(;)<br />
      <br />
      Maybe we could do some consultancy for them. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I already sent Ryan an email about the program, plus I made a "suggestion" to Wild Tangent that they should perhaps consider talking to him about incorporating his software - there's more chance of that than AVS, which is Nullsoft owned.<br />
      <br />
      I highly doubt that they will do anything decent, I downloaded their plugins again and remembered why they were so dodgy.<br />
      <br />
      The interesting question here is - why did Microsoft choose WildTangent?</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to know why they chose WildTangent, come to US and look at most of the teenagers. Let's just say I'm surprised most don't bring porn to school :)<br />
      I'm guessing that WildTangent will focus more on physics of jiggling boobs than the dancing itself...<br />

      &lt;- 3D-less. :(</p>
