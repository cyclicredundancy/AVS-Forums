      <br />
      This is a new advanced skin I have designed and is being coded now.<br />
      <br />
      I want this to be the first skin to be released with a custom AVS, to be released at the same time together called Venom AVS<br />
      <br />
      I will give the best avs preset that is posted here $40. and the rest will be shipped with the One that wins. Tell me what you think. Try to incorporate electricy or skin colors and graphics into it. Thanks!! prize money could go up depending on the responce to this.<br />

      <br />
      the electricity is going to be animated by me, and it is activated by sound. You guys just have to make your avs presets to show in the AVS's box. I dont think the AVS's can be put in the .wal but it will be released on the same day that this skin is.</p>

      </blockquote>Its the normal vis window, fps doesnt matter, complex or not, more thought that goes into it gets more points with me. The skin will have alot of different theme colors but to just make the avs to how you feel Venom should be portrayed is what i want. Its a cool skin make cool AVS's<br />
      <br />
      they might all be in the final download, but 1 will win!! 1 month till I stop taking AVS's

      <br />
      A lightning can be considered a fractal shape (up to the level of the air molecules that are being ionised) so the spectrum after sampling would contain an amplitude for every frequency (due to near-infinite aliasing), unlike regular music which is concentrated in the lower frequencies.</p>

      <br />
      Ya I think I can link a installer program from a window that pops up when the skin is first installed. That would be really neat. Then who ever makes a vis and sends it in to this contest will be in there. They will be rated from 1 to whatever the count of final AVS's. No AVS's entered as of Yet here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, I do have the newest Colormap, but I worked on it over the last day and made it now so that it uses Channel Shift instead of Color Map. I don't know if there is a newer version of Colormap or not, but I included the one I have with it. I might try to change the background around a little bit, because I don't like the way it turned out exactly, but it's good enough for now.</p>
