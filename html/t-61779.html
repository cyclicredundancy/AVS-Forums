      <p class="post-content"><strong>"Janne Manne" - Bad voting</strong><br />
      I just noticed a 2-star vote on my otherwise 5-star preset pack (Whacko AVS II). I don't mean to boast, but rather bring out a twisted person, "Janne Manne", who's been voting "From Arse: These are pretty crappy presets" on a lot of the 5-stars packs on winamp.com.<br />
      <br />
      His account will probably not be disabled under the guise of 'free speech', but his messages <i>are</i> abusing the rating system. Its purpose is to bring feedback to the authors and get an automatic mass-rating (which is always better than a simple one-man jury). His messages do neither, because he targets anything highly rated, votes with a hollow comment and a bad rating. Maybe he's just another one of those people who want to see their own crappy presets at the top?<br />
      <br />
      Janne Manne: No offense, but you don't learn good AVS skills overnight, and things like this will only get others mad, erasing any hope of getting your stuff rated highly. Instead of being so chicken, just post your stuff and see how it gets voted.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I totallly agree</strong><br />
      I totallly agree with UCD (UnConeD) here, something must be changed to the rating system here at winamp. It seems that any lame person here can kick you out of the 5 star just by adding a stupid comment. If I myself don't like a pack I just don't rate it anymore, because it's of no use rating it, since I might not like but I'm sure there must be someone outhere liking it and now the only result is that this bad rate only discouraged UCD to keep making these beeautiful packs. So when I should give it a low rating it would disappear from the five stars and some people who would love this pack would never have get the chance to see it. But I see there are still these stupid people who still keep giving low ratings to AVS or any other kind of plugin, while this stuff is infact art, and art is subjective to anyone, if you don't like it doesn't mean the whole world should not see it, because there are much people who WILL like it. I know that it's useless for me to type this, since there will always be people who don't get the point. But if you encounter one of those feel free to copy this reply or tell them what I try to tell everybody here.<br />
      Last ting I'll say about this is: It's better to not rate then to give a bad rating.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey ppl!<br />
      <br />
      i have to say we've got freedom of speech - the public vote system<br />
      was made for everyone to express what they want.<br />
      it's subjective - maybe there are ppl who don't like UCD's presets.<br />
      we don't understand them and have right to have different opinion. -<br />
      so let's express it in voting. there are truckloads of ppl voting<br />
      so one man can't make much mess i guess.<br />
      <br />
      and other thing: is it really so important to have those 5 stars?<br />
      i'm pretty sure that UCD knows exactly how much his presets are worth.<br />
      we showed how much we are amazed by his work and i guess such feedback<br />
      from ppl who are deep into avs is more important than any "lamaz" opionion ...<br />
      <br />
      ur presets are gr8 UCD, don't worry about the stars ...<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      [edit]okay, yeah, looks like they've hit enough packs to qualify for removal. reported.[/edit]<br />
      <br />
      [edit again]ah, see, these ratings may have gotten one of my packs among the top 20, yet i still reported it--aren't i nice? :p[/edit again]</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Not against low-ratings</strong><br />
      I'm not against people voting lowly on my presets, as long as they have a solid reason and express it in their comments. This person simply copies the same message each time, so I don't consider it to be a seriously intended post.</p>

      well, this changes a lot ...<br />
      repeating the same stuff doesn't seem to be right judging ...<br />
      so i'm gonna go and fix ur ratings :) - i'll vote for the 1st time in<br />
      my life!</p>

      In actual time I usually spend 10 hours in total or so, but spread over a number days. I work on one preset, let it rest a while, work on it again, etc... Never totally satisfied :)</p>

      Hey, guys!<br />
      A Votingsystem doesn't only exist for good votings ... I think, It's OK, when somebody say his honest opinion!!!<br />
      <br />
      But this "Janne Manne"-Person isn't honest :eek: This certain Person gave Whacko AVS II 2Stars and Marcos presets 0Stars ... they are some of the best AVS creators (I think) and the "Janne" votings are really shit!:mad:<br />
      <br />
      Hope, this lamer don't vote for my presets :( (although I want that people rate my Preset Pak, but I dont mean that kind of people...)<br />
