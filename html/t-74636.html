      <p class="post-content"><strong>My First Pack Now Published</strong><br />
      My first pack has finally been published on WinAmp!<br />
      <br />
      I got a 3 1/2 stars! Well, that's a decent start!<br />
      <br />
      I'm hoping to release another pack within the coming month.<br />
      <br />
      Check it out! By the way, most of these presets can be found right here at the boards, but, there are two presets in the pack not included on the boards.<br />
      <br />
      Here is the link:<br />

      <br />
      Enjoy!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Well, for some reason, the site i entered isn't working, but I assure you, the pack has been published...try looking for it from the directory.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I cant find it in the directory yet, either...<br />
      <br />
      Does it take a bit for it to become available to the public or for it to be seen through the site?<br />
      <br />
      I could see it in my email link, but not from the main site.<br />
      <br />
      Let me know if there is something I'm missing here........</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Yeah!</strong><br />
      Glad to see that your pack finally released! Congratulations! I went and gave you a starting review. I'll ask Lady Anubuk to do the same. By the way, how long did it take for your pack to get published?</p>

      <p class="post-content">i think that i have to remove a star from my original review,<br />
      most of your presets are ok but i'm disapointed,<br />
      first of all you didn't have as much presets as i thought<br />
      and second of all, couldn't you tweak'em some more?</p>

      <p class="post-content">solamon, it only took about 2 and a half weeks for the avs presets to be published.<br />
      <br />
      montana, i may go in and tweak these presets some more, however, most of these presets will remain in their final form.<br />
      <br />
      I am working on another pack, which has some better presets. These are my beginning presets, and they're not supposed to be spectacular.<br />
      <br />
      You might be disappointed, but, remember. I'm a beginner, still......are your expectations a bit high? :)<br />
      <br />
      In any case, have a good day, im out for a bit.......:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">what i meant was that you have <b>really</b> improved your skill<br />
      and you use these presets that didn't show a lot off skill, mostly "begginers preset"<br />
      (maybe it is what you mean with name of the pack)<br />
      i would put in some more of the presets that you have displayed here, like the sandscope I &amp; II and blackholedkaliedioscope and maybe<br />
      some presets and remixes (hopely one of mine)</p>

      <br />
      I have about 5 ready for the next one, but I want it to be at least 10 presets, but I can include some of your remixes in it to make it larger, if you would like, and maybe some other folks remixes if that would be acceptable.</p>

      Why does it seem like your posting like your a 'pro' in avs? saying that your all disappointed and giving people, even n00b's bad to 50 to 60% approval rating?<br />

      <p class="post-content">blurpak2k1: i create a lot of shit<br />
      if you look into my first pack, most of those that i like didn't most people like, even so in my second pack, i did some hot shit, and i did pure shit, but enough about me<br />
      <br />
      i'm a hard person to satisfy (not sexually speaking) just because i seen it all and most of the things i see know is just replicas of each others stuff.<br />
      <br />
      i'm not a pro, i can be as goos as elvis &amp; unconed, but i'm tired of school and some times can even stand math/algebra/trigonometry which is my favorite subjects (yeah i know it's a little geeky), if i act like i pro i apologize, i'm not a pro but want's to be one.<br />
      <br />
      i was disappointed of aaron's first pack just because he made a lot of hot shit that i wanted to see in the pack and he deliveres a pack thats only include 10 presets, c'mon he did more than that</p>

      <p class="post-content">Still Montana, I must agree with BlurPak in saying that you are overly harsh on people. You hardly ever say what is done well, but always leap to what is done (according to you) poorly. I don't know if you think that you're doing favors by telling people what's wrong with their presets, but I don't believe that's very helpful at all. Negative feedback does not encourage people to learn more and do better. It only decreases the satisfaction they have with their own work and thereby stifling further progress. Furthermore, being "hard to satisfy" degrades the value of your opinion because people just begin to pass you off as an overly critical asshole (maybe you can see this begining to happen already). Not to mention being hard to satisfy mean YOU WILL BE SATISFIED LESS. I don't know about you, but it would seem being satisfied more would make one a happier person. I'd rather be easy to satisfy and happier than hard to satisfy and doomed to constantly see what is wrong with everything. There was no reason to write a second post taking a star away. You went out of your way to let Aaron know his work was only worthy of 2 out of 5 stars. Why did you waste your time? What scale are you judging Aaron on? He's a beginner, he should not be judge on the same scale as El-Vis or UnConeD or the like, thats not fair. He should be judged according to his level of skill. And for his level, I think he deserves more than 2 stars.<br />
      <br />
      You should try being more positive. It would help out you and the people you critisize more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">look, i don't like things to be similar, some of what aaron did is very similar to other things, even though my presets have similarities, i do want varation, especially when almost anything has been done (in the simplest stagest)<br />
      sidenote: i have a lack of inspirition for my forthcoming pack, mostly because i feel like i don't make anything new, almost all things i done has been done before<br />
      <br />
      i also look for the preset as a effect, thats how i make presets, i try to make nice effects, i don't just want nice elements, i want to see if the preset can make by it self<br />
      <br />
      then at last i want pleasure for the eye, i don't want epelepsia just because some artist decided to put a invert where it not supposed to, even the most criticly acclaimed artists has missed out some time of eye-pleasure<br />
      <br />
      i think don't think actually that my review of aarons first pack was to rouge, i believe that negative critism can be good because it helps the artist to see mistakes so the artist can adjust it, as someone said<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">well you can do is: tell the person in what way "specifically" what could be changed to help but not flat out negitive response "okay its a 3.5 out of 5, no wiat i think its a 2.5 instead, sorry..."<br />

      <p class="post-content">ok, now that you guys have had your little bitch fight....<br />
      <br />
      playing: Liquid Dub vol. 7 (dragonfly records, uk)<br />
      <br />
      some random thoughts while i flick through the pack...<br />
      <br />
      nice title screen, I like how designers are including title screens, i try to use them (set to hotkeys) when i'm doing live shows.<br />
      <br />
      the chromatic colours and blends in Awesome v4 are making me horny. ( everyone stand back :p )<br />
      <br />
      Exploding nebula... nice concept, but fyrewurx...ick.<br />
      <br />
      Psychotic Windmill, i love the way the reds and blues work to create little flames towards the center. Not too responsive to the music, but i just changed the movements to Source Map on beat and that got things kickin. I made it a little too busy tho', perhaps you can work some magic on this<br />
      <br />
      aaron i really like SuperScope Scroll, hmmmmm...nice....<br />
      especially with this cruisy album, it's subliminal and sexy and occassionally the colors tantalise with peaks of brightness. good stuff.<br />
      <br />
      Spectrum Waveboard, i like this one because with this album (about 70 bpm) it's sometimes busy and sometimes simple, comes on in a rush with the sound. good for slow trance. the prism effect sometimes reminds me of floyds dark side logo (aaaargh, get that acid away from meeeeee ...) ooooh, now it's doin some really trippy stuff, god i love avs.<br />
      <br />
      Drum&amp;BassArena (react records, uk)<br />
      i thought some d&amp;b might make unchartered territory more interesting, however, this one was also unresponsive to music (or at least things were blending so fast i didn't notice the difference) occassional flashes of gold and red are really nice.<br />
      <br />
      if i was gonna rate this pack i'd have to give 4 outta 5 for the choice of color, the blends, smooth transitions and intelligent forms ( -1 for use of fyrewurks and lack of complex shapes and planes some other designers use to good effect).<br />
      <br />
      personally, i can't design fer shit, but i know what i like. thanks aaron.<br />
