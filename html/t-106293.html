You can use it as unique tone by using a gradient from black to the tone color. But you can also do plasma/chrome-like palettes and more. Quite nifty :)<br><br>It allows any of the AVS output modes, except adjustable blend which I still have to do (but should be easy). The APE is quite fast (everything is unrolled, optimized MMX assembly) but of course if an existing component like unique tone does the job perfectly, choose that instead.
