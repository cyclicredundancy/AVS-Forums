      <p class="post-content"><strong>3d colors</strong><br />
      for the attached preset (note to self: attach file) I want to have normal 3d colors, but all I seem able to do is maxblend colors, which sucks if you have different color-intensities.<br />
      <br />
      any help on how to do this in normal replace mode?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The house refers to the "home" button in most explorers.. 127.0.0.1 is your home IP-address. therefore, "there's no place like 127.0.0.1" means "there's no place like home".<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm not an expert on this techniques. But perhaps the colors are wrong because the parts of the house are always rendered in the same order: first the roof then the sides and bottom. So the last rendered parts always seem to be infront of the object, even if another part should cover it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I havent looked at the preset cos I'm at uni but if you have essentially a rotating cube and you want to use replace mode you need to keep swapping the faces such that the last ssc/triangle render in your editor is always the front face. You also should optimise by not drawing the faces that are facing away from the camera<br />
      <br />
      This typically involves taking the normal of the face and putting it through your rotation matrices, then testing the result against a value to determine if it is facing the camera or not....this is backface culling<br />
      <br />
      To sort the faces you compare the 'final' z value of your faces (this will tell you what is further or nearer from the camera) and 'swap' them accordingly. Try a test with 2 faces, 2 opposing sides of a cube for example, use 2 seperate solid ssc's and swap the primary z value based on the final z values.<br />
      <br />
      Thats such a terrible description of both those ideas<br />
      <br />
      /me downloads preset to take home and fix<br />
      <br />
      I'll just fix it and upload it later :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">And 127.0.0.1 is actually 'localhost' not 'home'. (Try start-&gt;run-&gt;cmd-&gt;ping localhost then start-&gt;run-&gt;cmd-&gt;ping home) so the title of your preset is "there's no place like localhost"...mmm catchy</p>

      I know it's localhost, I was just trying to make n00bs understand it too and to have some sort of funny preset :igor:<br />

      Thanks a lot (in advance) for fixing it. I know i understand pure math code better than english literature, since the names aren't even close to what we call it all in dutch.<br />

      I think I'll understand it better if I read your above post over for about 5 times or so.. :)<br />

      </blockquote>As if to perfectly illustrate your point I have absolutely <b>no</b> idea what your saying.<br />
      <br />
      The easiest way to make your posts easier to read is to remove the double negatives, for example<br />
      <br />
      won't not = will<br />
      no one hasn't = everyone has<br />
      <br />
      Also lots of non-native english posters seem to like adding unnecessary preamble to their text like "I just want to say that in this case it is..." or "If I may just say so with regards to this particular subject.."<br />
      <br />
      I wont labour the point though, I'm sure its hard when english isnt your first language. Heck I'm sure your english is better than my finnish/dutch/estonian/latin/whateverthehellelse

      <p class="post-content">nothing exciting then (its an occlusion hack btw not a bf culling hack). Hopefully you've learnt the error of your colour coding ways from my fixed version.</p>

      <p class="post-content">since this is around my problem area, i hope someone can help me out:<br />
      i was fiddling with the megabuff again and i made something really cool. however, there are some ugly lines that connect the squares together. i don't have enough color manipulation skills to cull off these lines so if some math genius figured it out for me, that'd be great.<br />
      preset is here:<br />

      <p class="post-content">I took a brief look at it ampy but I think you need to re-code the structure a little bit. You would be better defining a square, then repeating that square with whatever offsets you want....<br />
      <br />
      point=if(equal(point,4),0,point+1);<br />
      x1=&lt;define square&gt;+megabuf(index)<br />
      y1=&lt;define square&gt;+megabuf(index+1);<br />
      z1=&lt;define square&gt;+megabuf(index+2);<br />
      index=index+bnot(point);<br />
      skip=bnot(point);<br />
      <br />
      define a square using equal(point,0)*bleh+equal(point,1)*blehbler etc..<br />
      <br />
      so you are starting a new square when point=0, and skipping drawing that line. I dont have your code in front of me but i think you used trig to define your squares which is not a good way (expensive)<br />
      <br />
      If anyone can be bothered to explain that better feel free :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">just need to make sure, because i never really dealt with equal/above/below functions very much, so what the equal(point,0) , equal (point,1) means is that you are telling the scope to draw a line from 0 to 1 so i would need a total of four lines to define a square right?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, yes you need four lines but thats five points per square because the last point and first point have to be the same to make it join up. My pseudocode should probably be point=if(equal(point,5),0,point+1); I rushed it off just to give you an idea of the structure.<br />
      <br />
      You can search the forums for a point to point square drawing method but I'll knock one out here quickly:<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      n=5;<br />
      point=0;<br />
      point:<br />
      x1=<br />
      equal(point,0)*-1<br />
      +equal(point,1)*1<br />
      +equal(point,2)*1<br />
      +equal(point,3)*-1;<br />
      y1=<br />
      equal(point,0)*-1<br />
      equal(point,1)*-1<br />
      equal(point,2)*1<br />
      +equal(point,3)*1;<br />
      z1=0;<br />
      point=point+1;<br />
      ....<br />
      <br />
      if you want it to be a long line of squares you can say<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      n=50;<br />
      point=0;<br />
      offset=-1;<br />
      point:<br />
      x1=<br />
      equal(point,0)*-1<br />
      +equal(point,1)*1<br />
      +equal(point,2)*1<br />
      +equal(point,3)*-1;<br />
      y1=<br />
      equal(point,0)*-1<br />
      equal(point,1)*-1<br />
      equal(point,2)*1<br />
      +equal(point,3)*1;<br />
      point=if(equal(point,4),0,point+1);<br />
      offset=offset+bnot(point)*0.1;<br />
      z1=offset;<br />
      skip=bnot(point);<br />
      ....<br />
      <br />
      that way 'point' defines the point of the square you are drawing, and when it hits 0 you offset in the z axis a little bit and draw another square. You get rid of the lines by setting skip to 1 when point = 0. I dont know if that code works as is, I'm not in front of AVS but its basically right.<br />
      <br />
      You should get my programming guide if you want learn how to do more 'advanced' stuff like this</p>
