      :winamp: Hello ! :winamp:<br />
      This is a small preview for my second pack ( first pack available at <a href="http://phazey.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://phazey.deviantart.com</a> ) and i just wanted some feedback for it...Any comments are needed ;) Oh and i should not forget to mention this : i started creating presets 1 month ago so do not except UnConeD`s or el-vis` kinda presets! Im still learning to code SSCs and DMs but im pretty satisfied with my work until now...All i need now are some comments,suggestion or ideas for my next pack.<br />
      <br />
      Regards,Phaze</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ive just taken a look at your first pack. Its not bad, i guess. It looks pretty good for a first pack but a pack full of remixes and other peoples superscopes with waters, mirrors and roto blitters really isnt that great. Ill have to see what youve done for your second pack before i can give out critisism though (constructive criticism btw). Oh and if youve used an ape in one of your presets include it in the pack and credit the author, i got an "unknown rednder object" in one of your presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Oooops!</strong><br />
      I had no idea i forgot to attach it ! Did i brag about it that much in the first message ? I guess you expect fancy SSCs and fast DMs :) Still learning the code...those ecuations with multiple xs ys and zs are really hard even though im good at algebra and geometry ;)<br />
      I hope you noticed in the first pack that the quality of the presets was small at the first ones and it growed...Oh and where i copyed code i mentioned it in the comment...usually i used SSCs with default settings and i played with them(testing varables without knowing what they are is FUN).<br />
      This preview is all my work except for a DM that comes from el-vis` disco preset(which was sooo smooth).I hope you`ll see some improvements :)<br />
      <br />
      PS.Looking in the zip archive i see all the right files and APEs and .asc...Prolly i made another archive and i wasnt paying attention/<br />
      <br />
      Go with the criticism raz ! You too Atero(please),,i have seen you give good tips :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">In the chinese, take out the mirror, water, mosaic, and fadeout. These change the final effect by very little(Except maybe the fadeout). Also, try adding a superscope or something to the middle. It isn't complete yet.<br />
      Shiny paradise- Nice preset. Could go without the 5-pointed distro movement(doesn't make too big of a difference and adds about 10FPS).<br />
      Another disco rmx- Really needs the alpha blending. Turn on the blend mode in the DM and I would recommend using a blend buffer and using a solid colored background. Not a big fan of fireworks either, try changing them to a more dynamic SSC.<br />
      <br />
      Overall rating: 2.5. Add more presets(3 isn't enough) and work on these some more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah pretty much what annubis said, another disco rmx looks like one of my presets after i tried transfering it between comps with a floppy disk and the effect list broke:p they need work and more presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The Chinese:<br />
      -Make the Interleave blocks smaller<br />
      -Get rid of Mosaic and Water<br />
      -Make the DDM a regular movement, since it's static (it'd be much faster as a regular movement)<br />
      -Make the dynamov move more, this needs to be more dynamic.<br />
      <br />
      Shiny paradise:<br />
      -I really don't like chaotic/random dynamovs, maybe it's me, but...gah...get rid of it<br />
      -In movement, never use source map unless you can't figure out the inverse movement. It's really ugly, and usually doesn't calculate every pixel.<br />
      <br />
      Another Disco remix:<br />
      -The DM isn't El-Vis's (I'm pretty sure), it's UnConeDs. Go look at the original UnConeD movement (try the Alien Chessboard one), and replace the effect list in his preset with the effect list in yours. This uses fog to get rid of the ugly-infinity-chaotic-ugliness.<br />
      <br />
      In general:<br />
      -Always put the APEs you're using in your packs. I deleted the 3D APE long ago, cos it was a waste of space IMHO. If you need a 3D object, make your own :)</p>

I really appreciate it and i hope you saw some improvements from my first pack.Btw this isnt a pack...some presets to show the style of the next pack(which i think im going to change ;) ).Any other question about this should go here or in troubleshooting ?<br />
      <br />
      PS : Where can i find that winamp installer ? i understood on the forums here but i didnt find it...winrar sucks compared to that :down:<br />
