I had a good winamp version where I start every party the AVS Visualation.<br>There was a good Song in the year 2000. Orange Blue - She's got that light. Somebody will remember :-)<br><br>At this good song a avs file was on my screen.<br>It was a black backround and four red rings. This four rings play after the beat from the song. At the backround behind the rings was blue and yellow points. It was fantastic.<br><br>I searched after this avs since four years. I couldn't find it.<br>I think the name from the avs was "Wormhole" or something special.<br><br>I would be very happy if somebody find this good avs.<br><br>Please help me to find the avs<br><br>Your Ben<br><br>add:<br>I searched the site from Steven Wittens - Acko.net<br>At his site are a lot of avs files. I install all files in my winmap. But there wasn't the avs file.<br><br>The AVS file have to be in one of an old Winamp version.<br>At the time i installed winamp i downloaded it from winamp.com<br>It was the AVS Visualization. I know this. Not another Visualization.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2010 11:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I'm not sure which one it is, but I've attached the presets that came bundled with AVS until some years ago.<br><br><font size="1"><font color="silver">search-engine keywords: classic justin tag lone avs newpicks bundeled old winamp2 winamp3 avs2.5</font></font></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2010 11:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">d'oh! forgot the attachment</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2010 11:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">not the most uncreative name on my computer - i had three with that name on my computer, but none matched your description. there are probably a thousand more out there using that name. however, if you felt unconed's presets were a good lead , you might also want to try some <a href="http://archive.visbot.net/el-vis/" target="_blank">el-vis</a> presets.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Winelectronic</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2010 11:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hello warrior of the king.<br>I install the avs files.
