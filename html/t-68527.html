      <p class="post-content"><strong>Unknown variables</strong><br />
      Well as looking in other peoples presets I notice variables that I can't recall what they exactly mean. Any help would be great, but if none is given that is fine as well.<br />
      In the trans movement I have seen a t variable use. t stands for?<br />
      <br />
      Superscope I see a lot of unknown variables. I also haven't done math for many years now so I may be a bit rusty. I see the t variable in this one as well. Are the g, b, r, variables short for green, blue, and red? I also see the s variable being used. s stands for?<br />
      <br />
      Dynamic movement are the variables the same meaning as in other trans options? I see a c, f, m variables. I can make some guesses or maybe I will have to just mess around and figure them out on my own, but some simple answer can also be an added help.<br />
      <br />
      Or maybe if the same variables mean the same thing, a run down of the variables would be awesome. I know many people are confused with these mathematical equations. I don't have the knowledge of all the functions, but if I did and got up my webpage making skills I would love to create a site for all new users, but since I'm not at that level I ask the high end creators to share some info.<br />
      Thanks</p>

      <p class="post-content">These are all variables meaningless to AVS itself, but used for other stuff. You can have almost any variable you want. "monkey" could be a variable. "thechickenthatattackedyourhousewithaflamethrower" could also be a variable. :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">superscope default variables:<br />
      x and y (duh) -1&lt;x or y&lt;1<br />
      i point on waveform/spectrum, 0&lt;i&lt;1<br />
      v value at i, -1&lt;i&lt;1<br />
      w,h width and height of renderer in pixels<br />
      red, green, blue 0&lt;variable&lt;1<br />
      n is how many samples per waveform<br />
      b is 1 if there is currently a beat, 0 otherwise<br />
      anything else is custom, sometimes people like to save pi to a variable, there are intermediate variables (say for making something be a certain color for more than one frame...)<br />
      in movement r is theta and d is... um... I haven't figured that out yet, because when you ADD to d, things move IN! I guess it's 1 minus the distance from the center... someone care to verify this?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>d = distance :)</strong><br />
      D is distance of course, but remember that you specify the *source* pixel for a given pixel.<br />
      <br />
      If you're given r=0, d=0.5 and you say d=d+0.1, then it means that the pixel at d=0.5 will get the color that's currently at d=0.6... moving inward :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Whoa, that looks like an excellent paper! Wish I had this when writing mine :)... it works ok, but I haven't really tested it for randomness.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, here's an explanation of | &amp;:<br />
      <br />
      - (a|b) converts a and b to integers and performs a binary OR on them (any bit that is 1 in either a OR b, is 1 in the result).<br />
      - (a&amp;b) converts a and b to integers and performs a binary AND on them (any bit that is 1 in both a AND b, is 1 in the result).<br />
      <br />
      % is the modulus operator. (a%b) calculates the remainder after dividing a by b (both operators are converted to integers first). For example:<br />
      <br />
      14/3 = 4 + <b>2</b>/3<br />
      So, 14 % 3 = 2.<br />
      <br />
      28/5 = 5 + <b>3</b>/5<br />
      So, 28 % 5 = 3<br />
      <br />
      The modulus operator is useful 'wrapping' numbers inside an interval. For example, the value (a % 4) for a ranging from 0 to positive infinity, is always 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,...</p>

      <p class="post-content">there are many AVS-ready variables or variable types that I have noticed in others' works.

Skip is a ssc variable that over 0, does not draw the line/dotcurrently being compueted. Linesize is a SSC variable that only works when the SSC it set to lines. It sets the &lt;b&gt; Line Size&lt;/b&gt; of the current point with a cap at 225. Come on, that one was obvious</p>
