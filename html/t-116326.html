In order to make anything really useful though you will need some understanding of how to code c++ for windows so that you can add controls to the 'options' frame of the APE. You might also want to figure out how to change hex color values in a useful way (RGB0 = RRGGBB00 in hex) since most of APE coding revolves around dealing with arrays of RGB0 colours.<br><br>I'm not sure exactly what level of c++ knowledge is recommended. If you've never done windows coding before it probably won't matter too much since most of any APE will revolve around modifying arrays. It will help a lot if you understand pointers and loops. Assembly is also very useful... particularly the MMX instruction set since it deals with the colours very well and very quickly. There is a technical manual in PDF format available somewhere on the intel website which covers every instruction set of every processor which they have implemented to date.</td><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></tr></table></div></div></body></html>
