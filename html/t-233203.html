      <p class="post-content">Okay, sorry if we appear a bit rude and not nice at all, but we get tired sometimes to have to tell things 200 times ..<br />
      We're all just really nice guys (okay, most of us :p)<br />
      <br />
      Okay, i'll stop about the .rar file and the missing credits.. (next time: just add someone's name and original preset name in the misc/comment, it's just 2 seconds of work)<br />
      <br />
      A short constructive review:<br />
      First One - Why have such a nice scope if you cover it up with that movement? at least set that movement filter to blend.<br />
      This is like installing a Lada engine in a Porsche :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Inside the cockpit<br />
      generally:<br />
      Too fast my eyes!!!<br />
      Technically:<br />
      The color reduction:<br />
      I don't see the effect of it.<br />
      <br />
      The ssc: having n set to 1100 is a bit overdone in my eyes. 400 or 500 should be plenty IMO.<br />
      tpi.. $pi is integrated now so you don't need to use acos(-1) anymore.<br />
      remove Rot and Point. Rot is constant, so there's no need to set them to 0 each frame, especially if they aren't even used:<br />
      calculating x1 and y1 the secondary time like this is useless, especially if you don't include point=point+1; per point.<br />
      <br />
      DM: Rot is defined but not used. better remove it.<br />
      x and y are static, so there's no need for a &gt;dynamic&lt; movement. Just use a normal movement with the same settings.<br />
      a small detail: multiplying is faster than dividing. use *0.5 instead of /2<br />
      <br />
      Also, you entire preset is inside a ignore/replace effectlist. move everything outside it because effectlists are slow. Creating AVS presets technicalwise is all about efficiency.<br />
      <br />
      My advice: Read the tutorials, because it seems you copypasted half your code here to me.</p>

      </blockquote>Yes, that's what i've pretty much always said at the end of the comment of my presets (except certain packs like the AVS PARTY series or strobotonic ones)<br />
      <br />
      But, like the kind hearted trusting fool that i am, i expected that people would <b>not be <u>stupid</u></b> about such simple thing as "give credit where credit is due" and decided not to yack about it in the comment. But my faith in humanity has been abused time and time again... Maybe PAK-9 is right and people really are idiots and i should include 3 pages of legal notices and license agreements on every one of my 20 packs and 778 avs presets i've made.<br />
      <br />
      This little rant here isn't exactly directed at fastingaciu even though the opportunity is here, im just a little tired and i have sand in my vagina, maybe i should go put my nightly astro glide on...<br />
      <br />
      Stay <i><b>cool</b></i> people! :cool::up:
