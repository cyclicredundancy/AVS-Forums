      <p class="post-content">The reason UnConeD, and a great deal of other people, don't visit sites with background music is because most people don't browse one page at a time - a sound that comes virtually out of nowhere is rather distressing in the computering world. Also, I'm probably listening to music when I'm surfing, and I don't like to be forced to listen to other people's music when I visit their page.<br />

      The bright red background just plain hurts the eyes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">PNG is the portable network graphics, the open-source graphics format of choice for computer-generated graphics. Everything supports it: photoshop, paintshop pro, IE, mozilla. Use PNG instead of GIF because GIF has ugly software patens from Unisys, and because PNG has all the functionality of GIF, plus more.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There is of course MNG, which is animated PNGs, but it's not supported as much.<br />
      <br />
      The main problem is IE: its PNG support is crap. Mozilla has been able to do alpha-blended transparent PNG's for ages, while in IE you need to do magic with DirectX filters for it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Err no... Mozilla is the open-source browser developed by a huge dedicated team.<br />
      <br />
      Netscape died years ago with NS4... Netscape now is just Mozilla with some extra junk thrown in. In my book, Netscape no longer exists and it makes me laugh whenever someone today still refers to Mozilla as Netscape. Though that's mozilla's own fault, because they use the ugly NS4 icons everywhere.<br />
      <br />
      Opera is not bad, it has a few neat features (like gesturing), but the shareware version is FILLED with ads which, combined with tons of unnecessary search bars, take up half of your screen. The pay-version is supposed to be better, but then again I can now use a free browser which doesn't take up half my screen and does what I want.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Also, Opera has bad memory management and broken image downloads. Often when I'm browsing DeviantArt I'll see half-downloaded images, even when it says the page is 100% done :hang: And also I get a lot of "Not enough memory for Opera to open another window" which is VERY annoying and never happens in the other browsers.<br />

      Second off some of these are incredibly noobish compared to others, some are just dot fountains and simple things, eg 001MV, its just a built in movement, dot fountain, moving partice and starfield and dosent look good.<br />
      <br />
      000MVintro - Looks ok i suppose, a picture, some text, water and water bump, nothin else to say.<br />
      001MV - "dot fountain, moving partice and starfield and dosent look good."<br />
      002MV - half decent effect i suppose, another of the simple ones.<br />
      003MV - meh, fireworks, nuff said (havent said that in about a year)<br />
      004MV - bassspindotfountainbuiltinmovement :p<br />
      005MV - not bad, the dynamic movement dosent seem to do anything but blend it though. At least in this one youve played with the rotating bow superscope.<br />
      006MV - not bad, the effect you got isnt too bad, its too grainy.<br />
      007MV - Pretty nice lookin', good colours. decent superscope.<br />
      008MVkerst - defaultsuperscopeoscilloscopestarmosaicfadeout<br />
      009MV - good superscope, ANOTHER dot fountain though. not bad, one of the better ones.<br />
      010MVkerst - Now this is better. Nice smiley face christmas tree, good work i guess.<br />
      011MV - pretty nice, could use some more effects, good superscope.<br />
      <br />
      Not really much i can say, there too simple, look at ateros primer, in his sig, soon to be updated blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH :blah: read it and keep throwing out presets and youl get better dont stop trying<br />
      <br />
      and incidentally pi in avs can be calculated as "acos(-1)", this is the quickest way too and lets not turn this thread into a discussion on how to calculate pi in avs please Atero and UnConeD and whoever else was puttin stuff on that thread a long time ago. :blah:<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, enough of my inane banter...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Short review:<br />
      <br />
      000 - :igor: ? :igor: Perhaps you could have chosen a bigger picture - Score: 1.5/5<br />
      001 - Better than my first preset, but you've had some tutoring ;) - Score: 2/5<br />
      002 - Aargh... ever heard of 'blur' or 'fadeout?' - Score: 0.5/5<br />
      003 - Too many FyrewurX's, looking better than 002 - Score: 1.5/5<br />
      004 - Setting Bass Spin to 'lines' makes it more watchable - Score: 1/5<br />
      005 - Flows nicely - Score: 2.5/5<br />
      006 - Stealing code won't get you far... give credit, dude!!! - Score: 1/5<br />
      007 - Dont overuse the dotfountain if at all... - Score: 2/5<br />
      008 - The mosaic doesn't make it look better. FAR too basic. - Score: 1/5<br />
      009 - The blue scope looks fantastic! Keep up coding. - Score: 2.5/5<br />
      010 - Funny! 3/5<br />
      011 - Looks kinda empty. Perhaps some extra movements would do good. - Score: 2/5<br />
      009-2 - ? Don't see the difference ?<br />
      <br />
      Overall: You can really see a process from the first to the 11th.<br />
      Nice for a first pack. For your next pack: don't add everything you make - Think about the quality! FINAL SCORE: :) :) :igor: :( :( (=2.5/5)</p>
