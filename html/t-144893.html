      <p class="post-content"><strong>The second AVS tournament</strong><br />
      After a great and succesfull tournament we decided to do another one :).<br />
      <br />
      It'll be based on the same idea as the last one. For the people who didn't join then: You start with a given number of players, and every round a few will have to go out (knockout system). Presets will be rated on how they look, how original they are, and how much they have to do with the name (each round you are given a name, an example from last round: glow in the dark). This will not be a race for who uses his best technical skills, which wouldn't be fair for the less technical AVS'ers.<br />
      <br />
      This means everyone can join, the higher leveled ones, but also the n00bies and newbies.<br />
      <br />
      For as far I know: Raz will join, and so will Siddhartha_one. Ishan_rocky volunteered to be judge again. I agree on that if the others do as well, because he did a great job last round.<br />
      <br />
      So who's in? <b>Everyone can join, it's just for fun, you don't have to be a math wizard!</b><br />
      <br />
      As for the start date, this is still unknown. It depends on how many will join, and when people say they can start making their presets.<br />
      <br />
      So let's go for it again :), it'll be great,<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">sure does, but the more, the better :). Keeps it more exciting. Oh, and judges, start simple eh ;) don't make up extremely hard things to do in the beginning. Not very polite for the newer people around here who might join. Unless you want to differ the man from the boys.... *evil grin*<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok we'll wait for Tuggummi before discussing starting times at least. I can't inform people at DevArt, I'm not a member over there. Perhaps somebody else can do so? Tournament will be on the winamp forums still, I hope they don't bother. Though the idea is good, it might attract quite some other players if they like the idea.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Jeeeeez, another tournament?<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, why not, i'm in :D<br />
      <br />
      Btw, we had a couple of damn good ideas what could be done better in the judging system (see last tournament thread) so please remember them BEFORE we start this one.<br />
      <br />
      I think it was like this:<br />
      <br />
      We need one coordinator who gets the presets by mail.<br />
      After a round is done, presets are randomly renamed and send here, then every contestant can judge them (except his own preset).<br />
      <br />
      The votes are send to the coordinator again and he publishes the result.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That indeed would be fairer, though it complicates things a lot. I like the general idea of the coordinator, though I don't like the idea of having to mail all the presets instead of posting them here. Also I can't see other peoples work (though that's fairer too ;)). We didn't have any problems with judging last round, so why change it? Ah well, I guess it's up to the judges. The idea is good :).<br />
      <br />
      Glad to have you in, Magic.X, and thanks for the judging support. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">The basic things i dont like about the other system is that you can do only one thing, judge or create. Both would'nt be only fairer, it would give all Members the possibility to evaluate the other presets which i would prefere.<br />
      <br />
      And the mailing thing is just fine. If the first posted Preset is some SupertechyUnConeDlikeawesomelooking stuff, the reaction among newbies is "OMG, i could never do something this good" which is fairly disappointing right at the start.<br />
      <br />
      Its just a suggestion. Take it or leave it, i won't mind. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">having 3 judges is fair enough. If we would start a system which means everyone rates everybody's preset, that would go way too slow. Mostly because of people who aren't regulars or have dial-up connections and cannot therefor check everytime to rate every preset. I've changed my mind about the mailing thingie, I guess it's do-able just fine :). And it's up to the judges to make some good topics about what we should do. I'm sure they'll start of easy for the newbies.</p>

      <p class="post-content">We aren't going to be choosing any topics where you have to have any sort of advanced knowledge. All of our topics will be more or less "themes" that you build your presets around.<br />
      <br />
      As for judging, I see nothing wrong with what we did last time. Having everyone judge would make it end up taking a really long time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">dunno, we're waiting for him to reply. Till that time signups are open to every one. After that I think we can get started :D.<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      I suggest 2 instead of 5 or so people get kicked out every round. Otherwise the round will go to fast. Just an idea, it's of course up to the judges. I prefer 2 each round.<br />

      <p class="post-content">We do that though, and we'll have like 7 rounds. That's a lot of rounds. If that's what everyone wants then let's do that. Opinions anyone?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm. Why do we kick anyone? We could sum up the points from every round in the end instead, so it will last as long peopel like! Besides this is much fairer, because noone gets kicked because he got a topic he couldnt be creative enough with.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Sounds good. It'll be more fun for the people who otherwise be kicked out in the earlier rounds as well. If we have a knockout system, I think 2 or 3 people should be eliminated each round, though I generally like the idea of Magic.X a lot more. :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, we got a topic ready. Doggy Dog will probably be judging(if not this round then the next one) - he should be back before the first deadline. I say we do 5 rounds. 5 rounds and 15 contestants makes 60 presets - A nice number for a large pack.<br />
      <br />
      Each of the three(two?) judges rates each preset out of 10 points based on:<br />
      1. ability to represent topic<br />
      2. overall appearance of preset<br />
      3. Um, there is no three that I can think of.<br />
      That means a possible total of 3*10*5, or 150 possible points at the end of five rounds. Top three contestants get recognition. It would be nice if they could have a custom title for a month like MOTM winners have(would that be doable mods?). If not, then they just get the nice feeling that they are better than everyone else.:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'll post the topic soon. First a few more details to work out:<br />
      <br />
      1. How long should the time be to make the preset? 1 week sound good?<br />
      2. Since the point total is cumulative, can people join in after the first round and still be put in the competition? They'll be at a disadvantage of having missed rounds, and it will allow people who happened to not know that we were doing it to still be able to participate.<br />
      3. Once again, there is no three.:p</p>

      <p class="post-content">I guess it doesnt matter if you miss rounds now then.<br />
      A week sounds like easy enough time, though people seemed to not get it in time last time.. ie me..<br />
      oh well.. people miss out, its their own silly fault..<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      Oh, usually the third thing to look for would be the technicalness of it, not neccessarily groovy insano code, but just the techniques they have used to get the effects. .,.. but oyu might not want to judge on that in this thing.. seeing as there are many youngens here.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The time of posting is labelled on each post. You posted that at 3:05 AM.. I hope at least that everyone gets the time in GMT on the forums otherwise it will screw everything up + I live in the GMT time zone.. not too far from Greenwich either... so it saves me hassle. :)<br />
      <br />
      Atero: I was more hinting at people waiting for everyone else to post so they can examine the competition and strive to make their preset even better... its not exactly cheating but it would be really annoying because it would slow things down, if two (or more) people did that and ended up posting on the last day at practically the last minute, if everyone actually had their presets ready a few days earlier. Rushing is bad... I know I posted my preset pretty quickly, but it was one of those mad inspiration things rather than a rush.. I couldn't stop myself from AVSing so quickly!</p>

      <br />
      I would like to add one small note to my tournament entry "the dream". I've just watched it on my new computer and it's way faster than it's meant to be. To the judges, it's meant to run with about 6-7 FPS. More than this will speed up the preset a lot, which will still look pretty nice, but not very dreamy. I hope you can take this in consideration while rating the preset,<br />
      <br />
      Thank you :)</p>

      This is a winrar file. Its like zip, but another compression format.<br />
      <br />
      Do the following:<br />
      <br />
      -get WinRar (or WinAce)<br />
      -unpack the preset<br />
      -repack as a zip file<br />
      <br />
      And keep in mind that changing file extensions wont change their type or content.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's just as Raz said. If you've a clear descritpion of what is expected, you can start up work nearly immediatly - but the results would the more look alike, the more the description is close to the point.<br />
      <br />
      So all you gotta do is come up with a good idea that you like.<br />
      <br />
      Is it really this hard? You can dream about everything imaginable.<br />
      <br />
      Examples: (Drugs, Sex, Flying, Nightmares, ...)<br />
      <br />
      It's not the point to make everything look dreamy (what is dreamy anyway? sometimes its sharp, sometimes blurred) but to give the viewer the intention that this is a dream. (Comments may help here)<br />
      <br />
      Hey, even a cube DM with a photo of your gf on the sides would do, coz you dream of her every night. :D<br />
      <br />
      So again: get your ass moving, be creative! There are still 2 days left.</p>

      I did get rid of <b>some</b> of the rotation, ie, anything below the guy. But i wanted to leave it reasonably dynamic. Its hard to tell if i achieved the right effect when im the one making it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">No, we gotta judge first(well, we did last tournament, anyways). I'll talk to ishan though, and see if we can get it out any earlier. Probably won't get it out at 12, but it's almost possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay, this obviously isn't clear, since me and j got in an argument over it (fortunately jaak stepped in and started being a total ass, which fixed everything) - are people getting dropped this round or not? i say they should, i know i'm not participating in it if it isn't going to be a knockout tournament like it was supposed to be...personally i think if you missed the first round, tough cookies. but that's just me...</p>

      <p class="post-time small text-muted">28th August 2003 23:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p>

      <p class="post-content">We decided by a general vote that this wasn't going to be a knockout tournament. People didn't seem to like the knockout tournament - if the first topic wasn't a good topic for them and they made a crap preset, then they could be dropped even if they would have been capable of beating the pants off people in the next rounds. This way, people who may not like the certain theme(you, for instance) still are in good contention, because other people probably won't like the next one. Letting people in after the first round is fine too, because they will have the disadvantage of having not gotten any points for the first round. The winner(s) of the tournament are not going to be selected on average score, but their cumulative score. People who miss out on this round will be behind by a maximum of 30points(if Doggy_Dog is judging as well). That's a severe hinderance to them, but if they do really really well in the next rounds then they could catch up. This method is also better to use in a tournament of this size. In the last tournament, despite its smaller size, we had to hold off on the next round to wait for people on vacation. In this competition it allows for people to leave without us having to wait for them - they get penalized some(although we will still try to get them into the round if it isn't a big difficulty - we did wait for you), but it could become insane if we didn't. Also, with 2 weeks for each round, they would have to be on a LONG trip to not be able to submit anything.<br />
      <br />
      If you don't want to continue in the tournament, then don't. It doesn't make sense to me, but do whatever you want to do. We would like to keep you in it, but we can't change any major rules that we set up before unless everyone agrees.</p>

      btw i hate this topic too, it's as lucid as the last one (:p), but i already have a preset that fits it perfectly...does it count? ;)</p>

Try making topics like they were in Tournament 1. That were topics which really pointed to a certain style. Oh well, at least I think you're doing just fine. Keep it up!</p>

      Robotisgod deserved that high score.. I only just now looked at the preset and it is visually sweet and technically competent... the only problems I have with it are the dm glitches that pop up every now and again and the lack of aspect ratio correction... y=y*w/h; at the beginning will fix this.. I can't see what causes the random glitches tho, great effort!</p>

That sucks a little bit, but I like this new topic because it has some creative applications I'm making up, and I get to make some cube based preset.

      <p class="post-content">I probably would have fininshed mine by now, but I just spent a few days getting not one, but <b>TWO</b> viruses off my computer (the blaster worm and the nachi worm), and they totally messed up my modem, so now I can only go online at certain times. So I haven't been on the computer much either because I'm just kinda frustrated I guess. I'll probably have to re-install my OS software to get everything back to normal. :mad:<br />
      <br />
      But I do have a definite preset now, so that's good :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is my submission.<br />
      <br />
      It's designed for AVS 2.7 and will not work in any of the lower versions. I know I'm actually not supposed to use it, but I really was in the mood for it, and this is about the best I can do. And then again, most (if not all) of you have avs 2.7 so everybody can see it anyway. My excuses if somebody is really pissed of now because I made this 2.7 preset. I hope the judges will allow it. PLEASE? :)<br />
      <br />
      Please also read the comment, it took me some time to make it up, and without it the preset doesn't make much sense with the topic.<br />
      <br />
      I hope you guys like it :)<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      requires high fps for the explosions to be on the right spot. Pixel doubling is possible in this one, it'll make it only a little bit ugly, but sizes &amp; coords will stay correct.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I just realized Deamon's is for 2.7. I have already said that you can't use anything that is in 2.7 and not the older versions. Deamon, you are going to have to redo that. The main reason I am not allowing it is not because some people don't have it yet, but because it may not be compatible in the future either. I'm pretty sure that we are going to make a pack out of the presets - we need to make sure that all of the presets will be includable. Sorry, Deamon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well deamon, you can only blaim yourself for that... pre releases are only ment for testing that it works or doesn't work, they are not ment to be used as the final presets making versions... Hence i strongly suggest that you don't do any more presets with the pre releases! Because you can't really know if something you made with pre3 will work with pre4 or the final version!</p>

      <p class="post-content">ARGH, AVS does not want me to finish this preset. First my whole first idea messes up because the raytracing i did doesn't support full 3d rotation for displaying properly. (Don't ask why, if i knew i'd have fixed it and have finished the idea/still be working on it) And now i have to go back through everything and cock about with shit because of crashing. Dammit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here is my second entry for this round. I took out the synched explosions, and the Color Modifier. Now it has a colormap and random explosions. It's a lot simpler, but I hope the judges can look at it a bit, as if the explosions are still at the right place, please? ;)<br />

      God i give up on this idea now, it's just not coming together, i've got bits of code lying around in about 12 different presets that won't go together. I'll take one and make a preset out of it.</p>

      <br />
      I made this in 2.7 first and had to change it back.<br />
      So i changed $PI into PI and set PI=asin(1)*2 on init.<br />
      <br />
      Worked fine ;)<br />
      <br />
      So far for my first 3D preset.:blah:</p>

      <br />
      I expected more high quality presets from others but i have'nt seen anything really impressive.<br />
      <br />
      Nic's and R(y)a(n/z) are nice. The latter one seems to be a bit buggy and snaps from one view to another one.<br />

      I thought it was due the 30th!<br />
      I'm still not finished though... I wanted to have the camera circle around and go through different angles but DM/SSC syncing is damn hard stuff... I also wanted to have little "X" rock formations in the background...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You remember in those LooneyToons when Daffy duck was "Duck Dodgers?" Well I wanted to make a preset where he comes in on his crash landing and skips across the ground before smashing into something.</p>

      And when the fuck will those scores come? Damn, this is getting dull here :(. Is everyone still enjoying this here? I am, if there would be somewhat more enthusiasm again. Am I the only one, or what?<br />
      <br />
      btw. Nice preset, Akuso</p>

      <p class="post-content">Look - there are no books about AVS coding, but there are books about raytracing, 3D stuff, and a lot of other useful physics and math books. You just have to look around. One good book is "Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus" by Andre LaMothe. He is coming out with another one in the series(acutally - it may already be out...) which will go into a lot of 3D topics - supposedly. This will probably include raytracing and raycasting as well as other cool techniques such as shading, light, and shadows. Not to mention collisions and other physics stuff. His first book really helped me out a lot - it has some cool stuff with rotation and such that can really help and he presents in a very understandable manner.<br />
      <br />
      You just have to know where to look - there are plenty of other books out there - this was just an example.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can you post some links to pages that I can easily use for my avs math knowledge? I have a knowledge level of approximately zero. I found the second link very useful though. And I know a tiny bit about 3D/2D conversion. Raytracing is still to hard for me. Some low-level math, that can be easily implemented in AVS would be great. Thanks in advance.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt;<br />
      Perhaps something that I can use in the DM. The only thing I can do (and understand) is making a random rotation, or a movement to left and right (and up and down). So that's about nothing as well.<br />
      &lt;/edit&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well lets see...<br />
      <br />
      Uhh you'll wanna know lots of trig if you want to do some real nice DMs and SSCs.<br />
      <a href="http://www.catcode.com/trig/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.catcode.com/trig/index.html</a><br />
      <br />
      so with you can do TONS of things with just that basic knowledge from that site. You just have to think of weird ways to implement it all. So say you wanted to make the screen to wave up and down or something. Sine and cosine act in waves! So lets think it through. If we want it to wave up and down then the X axis is left alone so...<br />
      <br />
      x=x;<br />
      <br />
      Now we want the Y values to move up and down from their original position in terms of the X axis value. So we take the original value of y and add the sine of the x value...<br />
      <br />
      x=x;<br />
      y=y+sin(x);<br />
      <br />
      It's a wave. Now say we want it to actually move in a wave. Well that means we have to some how change the value inside the sine function. So lets create a new variable 't'. We'll define t in the frame section. Try out t=t+.01; Now we need to add that into the value inside the sine function so we get...<br />
      <br />
      t=t+.01<br />
      --------------<br />
      x=x;<br />
      y=y+sin(x+t);<br />
      <br />
      Yeah good ole' trig. Most cool movements will some how come back to trig so I'd suggest starting there. Once you've played around with that a lot you really showed start learning about vectors. They are incredibly useful. Read up on dot products and cross products and what they do. Then you can get into to some really cool stuff.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.math.com/" target="_blank">http://www.math.com/</a><br />
      <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/" target="_blank">http://www.physicsclassroom.com/</a><br />
      Those two have some useful information on them too. What else are you looking for?</p>

      <p class="post-content">ehm... good question ;).<br />
      <br />
      Ok, I worked on that url you gave me, and I fully understand that part now. The example helped a lot as well. I now have the feeling like: wow, I know some math, great. ... Now what? I find it hard to visualise what I want in my head, and sometimes when I come up with something, it always looks to hard for me to solve. So, now I understand this, what's next to study? And to aply on AVS?<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      1. Maybe you guys could make a different thread to post all of this in, this one is for the AVS tournament and it's getting a little too much off the topic imo....<br />
      <br />
      2. Where is everyone? We've only got like 2 or 3 presets! Probably due to school and stuff......</p>

      <br />
      This tournament reminds me of the tortoise and the hare. The fastest people are the hares (in this case the best AVS-ers) but the slowest poeple are the tortoises (in this case the not-so-the-best AVS-ers). The hare drops out of the tournament frequently while the tortoise never drops out, and ends up winning. :D:p

      <p class="post-content">no worries mate :). It used to be red-white-blue. That sucked hard. After that it was brown-orange-red-yellow. That was better, though fire-colors can be used a lot better (see my wallpaper thread in the presets section). So now it's this color setup :).</p>
