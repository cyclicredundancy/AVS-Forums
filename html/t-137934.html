I love making AVS files for my winamp. But when I realized that there are others who make presets, I was excited. I was greatly influenced by ELVIS, Unconed, and Artero. These great Mathematicians helped me tremendously! I cannot give them enough thanks for their explanations of the Math, the Functions, the Renders... all that stuff. Thank you men, for what you did.<br>Remember this is my first real Preset AVS Pack for Winamp. They are pretty neat. I hope you enjoy looking, mocking, changing them as much as I had making them! ENJOY...<br>Oh, the title for this preset is 'SuperScope Annomelies'! Now enjoy!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th June 2003 08:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">wow...<br><br>i'm just...<br><br>amazed...<br><br>someone placed me next to unconed...<br><br>thanks :D:D:D:D:D<br><br>out of this pack, the box presets really stood out...but they both need to be more dynamic. your syncing consists of a static on-beat setting (bad) - use something like:<br>(getosc(0.47,0,0)*8753%100)/500-0.1<br>this takes an arbitrary oscilloscope position and permutates it to the point of fair randomness :) if you don't know what any of that means, study up on the modulus operator (%).<br><br>the vecto preset was also very good, but it too needed to be a lot more dynamic. overall all of your 3d shapes need to be more dynamic - you've got a good handle on modeling them, now you need to polish them off and make them look good :)<br><br>hope i've been a help,<br>--atero</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th June 2003 08:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Very nice for a start!!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th June 2003 08:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I agree with atero on all counts...<br>Your a long way ahead of the majority of those who come here for the first time.<br>You definiatly need to learn how to use the dynamic movement.

Small screen users may not see the text properly.<br><b>2intro</b> - Found in the comment.<br>HISTORY by EL-VIS 2002<br>-- <a href="mailto:Nagel.Frank@t-online.de">Nagel.Frank@t-online.de</a> --<br>-- el-vis.deviantart.com --<br>-- nagel.frank.bei.t-online.de<br>What's this?<br><b>3dcircles</b> - I too have the same problem. Cant get proper names for the presets :( Not a very attractive preset though.<br><b>3d rotating scopes with dots</b> - Cyan - Spiral graph fun, Red - Spiral, Yellow - vibrating worm, green - vertical bouncing scope, orange - Alternating diagonal scope, blue - 3d scope dish. Am I right?<br><b>3d rotating scope</b> - Not much difference.<br><b>3d rotating scope</b> - Not very interesting.<br><b>Another tunneling thigy</b> - Doesnt look like a tunnel in any way. n00bish.<br><b>Box</b> - The colours are good and soo is the on-beat brightening. The best preset till now.<br><b>Box2</b> - I like the first one more. Thebump gives the flow a pseudo 3d effect which spoils the 3d effect of the scopes.<br><b>California Sun</b> - Come to India, there's sun everywhere! As hot as being in a furnace.:)<br><b>Goldfish Tank</b> - The orange blobs dont look like a goldfish to me, perhaps you could make something more intereseting.<br>[B]Knocked over hourglass{/B] - Ugly, but allright.<br><b>Metropolis</b> - Quite a good preset, but there's a lot of cyan in it, could have used an extra fadeout.<br><b>Party Sphere</b> - Very very similar to newpicks - pretty dots.<br><b>Rotating pretty thing remix</b> - The bump is static, the color codin static and the preset is not very responsive. At the same time it is not good looking too.<br><b>Something</b> - You can make time correct you know...<br><b>Sphere</b> - quite an interesting preset.<br>sphere:<br>i=i*pi;<br>x1=sin(i)*sin(i*40)*.3;<br>y1=cos(i)*.3;<br>z1=sin(i)*cos(i*40)*.3;<br><b>Sphere2</b> - I guess you got it right :p<br><b>Stargate</b> - The backgroung and the ssc colours dont match, thats why the preset doesnt look good.<br><b>Surface of the sun</b> - Would be better if the colours remained in the 'sphere' and the stars outside the sphere.<br><b>Water fountain</b> - Boring.<br><b>The dancing star</b> - Dont like it very much.<br><b>Face lift</b> - Looks much more like a face.<br><b>Vecto</b> - Add a color-map or something to make it look better. THIS preset doesnt look good in black 'n' white.<br><br>If you are doing AVS for three yrs, then definately this is not upto the mark</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th June 2003 13:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Be VERY careful to give appropriate credit when you use other people's code or general ideas.

I can't even do some of it now, though I'm getting a hang at it. Search the forums for my first pack (author: deamon, pack name: iab avs), for some really simple effects which still come together to a nice preset, you might learn from it (though I think you already know that kinda stuff :p) And for the rest, keep tearing apart all the presets you can get your hands on, it's the best way to learn AVS besides just trying.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th June 2003 09:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Bigbob</i><br><b>Thank you gentelmen for all your help and support.
