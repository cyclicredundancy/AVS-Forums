I am an avid AVS user who has tried and (for now) failed to learn how to make AVS's. However, when "DeskMod ONE" came out I had hoped for another one to soon follow. Due to the recent slow-down (although not much) in AVS preset making, I decided that now would be a good time to try and make a contribution to the AVS community by releasing what will most likely be several packs of some of the best AVS visualizations <i>ever</i> made (with the author's permission of course).<br><br>This is where I could use everyone's help. Although I currently have... um... <i>*click* *click*</i> &lt;muttering under breath&gt; <i>damn!</i> &lt;/muttering under breath&gt; over 1000 presets, and I can't possibly find all of the best ones.<br><br>I would appreciate it if anyone would let me know what some of their favorite presets are.<br><br>&lt;edit&gt; <i>Damn... I just realized that this thread should be in the upper level... but it won't let me delete and repost... any mods willing to help me out here?</i></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2003 07:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Sorry, but this just sounds like you're trying to get famous with other people's hard work.<br><br><b><font color="#FF0000">I <u>DO NOT</u> GRANT YOU PERMISSION TO USE MY PRESETS</font></b></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Wiser87</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2003 07:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">No, it's nothing like that.
