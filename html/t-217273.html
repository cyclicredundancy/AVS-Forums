      ok in this preset(s) (there are two but they're almost the same thing) i tried to use the primary colors represented by fading particles to fade to the different colors in the spectrum, i notice it hardly ever produces green, and i would like any advice on what i would need to do to make it create a more full color spectrum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try using cyan, magenta and yellow. When you pick a color, go to the right side of the panel and fill in 255 in for two colors each time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the reason why green is missing in your presets is, that you used the primary colors of <b>subtractive color combination</b> (red, blue, yellow). Computers (and also AVS) use <b>additive color combination</b> where you have red, blue and <i>green</i> as primary colors! Also you have to set your 'color-donators' to additive draw mode (for the particles set: Blending Additive) cause otherwise you don't have any color mixing so that the other colors won't get mixed.<br />
      <br />
      I guess now you know yourself how to get that idea to work :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">^..^: the primary colors for subtractive coloring are /not/ "red, blue, yellow", but "magenta, cyan, yellow".<br />
      <br />
      "Red, yellow, blue" is an antique meme propagated by bad graphics teachers.<br />
      <br />
      And remember, the only reason there even is such a thing as primary colors is because we only have 3 different types of color receptors. Physics only knows the spectrum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol, ummm..... i'm not sure which one cyan is... :p or which specific one magenta is either lol, but do you guys like the end result?<br />
      <br />
      btw i may remake it if unconed tells me which colors are correct :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i'd say you should stick with red, green and blue (just as you did). It's the best way to get all colors mixed.<br />
      <br />
      In case you really want to use subtractive coloring in AVS, use:<br />
      (255,255,0) for yellow<br />
      (0,255,255) for cyan and<br />
      (255,0,255) for magenta<br />
      (correct me when im wrong again unconed ;))<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">i'll go change the colors and have a look to see what i like more<br />
      <br />
      [ADDED]i think RGB makes a fuller spectrum in this case, so i'll stick with that<br />

      <p class="post-content">the idea is not bad, but there are some things that can be improved.<br />
      For example why is there a 'set rendermode'(set to 50/50) above the moving particles? Didn't you want to have additive draw mode?<br />
      And why are you fading to yellow? That way you prefer one color in the result.<br />
      <br />
      Since this makes me think you're not that familiar with the components of AVS, i suggest you have a look <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">the fading to yellow was my mom's suggestion i think (i asked her about the primary colors and she started helping me with it) plus wouldn't it always favor some color? since i have to fade to a color? (even if it was black?)<br />
      and about the render mode : i tried "additive mode" before for the dots and it resulted in kind of a white-out effect so i didn't try it for the set render mode.<br />
      NOTE : i thought i still had the dots set to 50/50 also</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you were looking for a way to receive all the colors, I've attached a preset with particles of colors CMYK that does just that. As for the preset itself, as ^..^ said, the idea isn't bad. I'm not sure if this is what you may have been trying to achieve, but this is just my re-vision of it. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">no that's not quite what i was trying to do, i meant the dots to be obliterated by the mosaic, and be there purely to mix colors, as a sidenote i do think using the scatter and blur trans defeat each other also (at least since i use blur to get the effect of being quasi anti-aliased.)<br />
      i do like that, but if it's going to be done i think the mosaic and dots should definetly be a "one or the other" thing in terms of final visibility.<br />
      i do think it was a rather nice preset though...</p>
