      I did some major work on my water movement preset. Firstly, i optimised that cluttered, unorganized, unreadable code for the scope and made my little outline effect with it. For the background i scrapped that crappy squares on a bit curvy piece of shit background and wrote one of those DM's that just uses alpha blending that morphs around and ive used blue and white clear screens with the alpha blending to make a nice relaxing watery effect, i think its quite nice :) all the usual crap very welcome, comments, etc :)<br />
      <br />
      edit: actually now that i look at it, it looks more like clouds, maybe i should turn it into a sky preset or something... suggestions always welcome.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pretty nice, the scope does look uhm... "wavy" :p<br />
      Though it's awfully static in terms of music visualization. Maybe a bit better beat detection into the background or in the scope itself.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think presets should always music-oriented. If they look nice, but don't do too much with the music, I often like that as well.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That defeats the point of AVS. There are plenty of other cool graphics programs/screensavers, but AVS is meant to react to music. If you just want nice graphics, then get something else. AVS is meant to be used with music.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, but there are other programs that could make them much better, have them run much faster, etc.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, let's get this thread back on topic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok i got it, finally, this took some major tweaking and some major and i mean major fucking about but i did it. Finally im satisfied with this fuck forsaken DM, it took 3 days but its done now. i added a rather cheap texture to it. I also made it reactive to music more than just a crappy "rand(200)" not it has a whole entire getosc function. dont moan it reacts quite nicely IMO, also made the speed on the actual scope music reactive now, it looks screwed up at higher FPS though, it needs work i just couldnt be arsed once i finished the DM. Please, opinions, suggestions yadiyadiya be nice thanks :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I never dl'd the original one. If you want criticism - I don't like the checkered texture - use something that isn't static. Also, the DM doesn't seem very watery - more like folds in a blanket.<br />
      Rating: 3.5 - Shows some skill, but isn't very aesthetic.<br />
      <br />
      How's that?</p>

      <p class="post-content">thank you, not a half assed reply this time :p good point, the water movement was purely based on the scope, i just thought the DM was cool, ill put it to a better use and rework water movement when i get around to it.<br />
      then the DM will be better. I dont think ill make a blanket preset somehow so something abstract will do. ill pull something out of my ass tommorow, bed now.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah the scope is chaotic...At a certain point the ssc starts shaking at a very fast rate hehe :) Anubis : your balls preset did the same thing after some time on my computer. Anyway the DM is very nice.Like it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok this is what i did, i did yet more work on the DM and made it more dynamic and kickass but i just realised, it looks exactly like the DM from unconeds retrosquares. This is what i did with it but i think ill do something else with it because it isnt exactly original.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the whole idea behind that scope was "water movement", and you said (and i agreed) that the DM wasnt really watery so ill save it for when i stumble across a good water moving DM/bunch of scopes. Dont worry, water movement will return, its this thing for now. I think it needs something else myself.</p>
