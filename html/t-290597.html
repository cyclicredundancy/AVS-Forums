      ive been messing about with this for several hours,<br />
      Im not very good yet since i only started tonight, has anyone got any tips?<br />
      <br />
      anyway, the quality isnt that good cause i used camtasia to record from my desktop, but check it out anyway and if you make them yourself i would appreciate some tips.<br />
      <br />
      btw, this probably sucks....:rolleyes:<br />

      <p class="post-content">firstly, things move very slowly around here, don't be dissapointed if you dont get a reply for a week.<br />
      secondly, upload the preset file itself in a .zip</p>

      <br />
      i thought somebody would've said something.<br />
      <br />
      anyway, heres the zip.<br />

      <p class="post-content">where to start..<br />
      there's a lot of things that need fixing.<br />
      firstly, never ever ever ever ever ever use an invert trans when clear every frame isn't checked. this is probably why after 20 seconds it just turns into a flashing screen.<br />
      also, try to smooth movements out as much as you can to get rid of jerkyness.<br />
      thridly, needs more colour. try to avoid 100% reds/greens/blues/yellows etc at all costs, they just look ugly unless used properly. aim for more muted pastel colours, and match them tastefully.<br />
      i think that's enough to work on for the moment.<br />
      good luck!</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok, been tweeking this up over a couple of hours and i also made another, both are way better, bit more fluid.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">phoenix is looking better, royal arch doesn't display anything.<br />
      next what you should try, is removing everything that doesn't have a noticeable effect on the preset. with phoenix you can delete the first 10 or so effects.<br />
      the key is cleanness in your effects list = cleanness in your preset. also the more stuff you can kill, the faster your preset will run.<br />
      still need to work on those colours though. use colours that are very similar and then just one or two 'feature' colours.<br />
      one more thing, bass spin renders are awful, avoid them at all costs.<br />
      also, there's a couple of picture renders in there, are we missing a .bmp file? you'll need to include that as well</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, i dont really like the bass spin effect on its own hence why its in the background, i was trying to simulate police car strobes<br />
      <br />
      ok, didnt realise you had to include the images, thats probly why nothing worked on royal arch :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I'll include them next upload:up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">i assume the preset has no code at all?<br />
      <br />
      my tip for you is to code. all the most impressive things are team efforts as well... at least imo.<br />
      <br />
      e.g. the typical super awesome preset will have:<br />
      <br />
      been made by PAK-9<br />
      using TomyLobo's triangle APE to render<br />
      a model loaded with my global variable manager APE<br />
      which is complimented with sprites rendered by UnConeD's Texer II<br />
      <br />
      doing all of this is dependent on code and uses code that other avs artists have authored.<br />
      <br />
      code is the key!<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">code maybe the key but i wouldnt even know where to start with avs code.<br />
      <br />
