      <br />
      BTW, about those BMPs (not that I want to borrow, I'm just curious), does that mean they can't be used no matter what, or do you require express permission (instead of just a credit)?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I love the visuals in this. It kind of goes against my philosophy on pictures in AVS but you've really outdone yourself here man. Amazing job. Some of them were a little boring or the idea had been overdone but all round this is an amazing pack. Great job man.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Already commented on DA but...well you know :D<br />
      Amount - good number,more would make this pack one of the largest ever<br />
      Quality - awesome ! I had no idea that using pics you can produce such trippy and cool effects.G R E A T JOB !<br />
      Technic side - you said you dont know coding and you hate it,well the presets show something else.<br />

      <p class="post-content">In the matter of using the pictures...<br />
      <br />
      Well first of all i want to state some reasons why i haven't given the permission to use my pictures.<br />
      <br />
      1) The pack contains pictures that are not made by me, i can't tell you wheter or not you can use those pictures it's up to the original author, but stating that you can't use my picture's hopefully prevents some ripping of their work as well as mine.<br />
      <br />
      2) The pictures are pretty preset specific, there for using them would only result in presets that look just as the same. I know it's not entirely true if you use them with water+rotoblitter+mirrors, but besides lame n00b stuff you really can't use them for anything else than the original idea.<br />
      <br />
      3) I just don't want to see my face swirled up in water+rotoblitter+mirror presets that are "Tributes for Tuggummi" I would hate that so much and if i see something like that anywhere near wa-dot-com or deviantart i will make sure it will get deleted for ripping.<br />
      <br />
      4) I hope this encourages others to use pictures too, but i also hope that you do them yourself. It's not really that hard and after all every avs artist should know atleast a little about image editing and creating images with some program (i.e. Photoshop, Photopaint, Paintshop pro etc..)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      This also means that you can't do any remixes from the presets, because that would mean you would have to use the pictures i have made. Unless you're lame and decide to do the same without pictures :mad:<br />
      <br />
      But, even though i stated that you can't use them in any circumstances i might give you special permission, IF i know you and you have a good reputation as an avs artist (you haven't ripped anyone)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe im overprotective or something in this matter, but i have my reasons and if you don't understand them then you can always remove my stuff from your harddrive and put me on your ignore list.</p>

      <br />
      If i say it's lame you consider it as a challenge? :igor: The pictures are really simple so i don't doubt that you couldn't do them with superscope... I just don't want anyone to do that. It's basicly just ripping off i think or do it the otherway to avoid copyrights... that ain't cool.</p>
