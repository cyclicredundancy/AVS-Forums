      <p class="post-content"><strong>libSuperScope, a library for learning superscope functions (BETA)</strong><br />
      Hi, I created a library of "building blocks" for the <b>AVS SuperScope</b>. They can be used to learn how to use the SuperScope or to create complex visualizations.<br />
      <br />
      The libSuperScope includes functions for creating:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Horizontal and vertical lines</li>

        <li>Square, rectangles and polygons</li>

        <li>Circle, arc, ellipse and spire</li>

        <li>3D shapes</li>

        <li>More complex shapes ...</li>
      </ul>All presets are configurable, the parameters are explained in a comment inside the preset:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~ccastill/libSuperScope/beta.png" target="_blank">http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~ccastill/l...Scope/beta.png</a><br />
      <br />
      Just unpack the zip file into your "Program files/Winamp/Plugins/avs" directory. This 29Kb package contains a brief introduction to the superscope, the libSuperScope library itself and some demos of how to use library.<br />
      <br />
      This is a beta version. I would like to hear your comments and suggestions before posting a 1.0 version. Thanks.

      <p class="post-content">This is a very nice package. Mattfury, i suggest you go through this and try to take it all in, you could learn alot.<br />
      <br />
      ChaTo: you could make the code a bit more readable by using some spaces within brackets and so on. At the moment it looks a bit jumbled because of the long variable names. Also, you can use comments (// and /* */).<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, its a nice idea, and a good guide to any beginner. Unlike a tutorial, this actualy requires the person to think, not just do.<br />
      <br />
      The example presets are pretty ugly though :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">i agree with sidd, this is worth a lot here. And Matt, I really don't believe this is a rip. At least I know none of <i>us</i> made this, or else we'd all know this, right?</p>

      <p class="post-content">well matt is probably just jealous, because someone showed up from nothing with some really well-coded presets...<br />
      <br />
      However, this pack offers a good way to learn: just look into the code and try to figure out what everything does...<br />
      That's mostly more efficient (and mentally demanding) than asking one question after the other.</p>

      <p class="post-content">some really nice examples, a way to learn alot on how to make scopes. but i guess matt was right this time in one preset: complex_plankton is codewise really familiar to unconed's plankton preset's SCC. not sure if its a rip, but the variables are identical :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hi everybody. Some of the COMPLEX_* and 3D_* shapes are originally from other authors (and I didn't try to hide that e.g.: I kept the original names such as 'plankton'). I will include the credits in the 1.0 release.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways in those cases my intention was to provide parametrized versions of their superscope parts, so other authors can learn from them. That's the idea of this package. Thank you for your comments.</p>

      </blockquote>Note that most of the pack is "original" -- or at least as original as a circle or a line can be :) -- If you feel umcomfortable with some of the contents of the package please let me know and I'll remove it when releasing.<br />
      <br />
      I think the importance of a library of SuperScope functions goes beyond learning, because someone could have artistic skills but lack the math background/skills for creating shapes with the superscope, and in that case tweaking the parameters of some basic shapes will be his/her choice. If anyone has basic, 3D or complex superscope shapes to include in the library, please let me know. Thanks.<br />

      <p class="post-content">i think if you have worked through paks great guide you should have learned enough to be familiar with the examples in your lib.<br />
      so what about if you gave a link to paks guide with your collection instead of making an own new tutorial? to me it would be enough.</p>
