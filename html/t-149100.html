      <p class="post-content"><strong>Presets for WA5</strong><br />
      Now I do not know if this will happen or not. But it is one of the things I would like to see.<br />
      <br />
      A collection of the best of presets people have created over teh past couple of years. :)<br />
      <br />
      A new newpicks as it were.<br />
      <br />
      Now I have no idea how we can organise it but mayeb if we post our 3 favourite presets (I know it is difficult but we could have thousands otherwise). Maybe too get feedback from the DA ppl<br />
      <br />
      Now it is too easy to decend into a DM-fest if you know what I mean (all DM-tastic presets :) ). Please try and show variety and diversoity, sound responsivness, etc that AVS can create, :)<br />
      <br />
      Now if we keep this thread for presets only!!<br />
      <br />
      Names of authors - preset name and a zip please.<br />
      <br />
      Discussion can be made in another thread if you chooses so no I hate that preset blah, blah, blah.<br />
      <br />
      Please don't just pimp your own stuff. In fact I am tempted to say do not include your own stuff and just nominate others. Yes lets do that. 3 other peoples presets. ok :)<br />
      <br />
      Please repeat other peoples choices too so we get a sense of popularity/numbers.<br />
      <br />
      Think long and hard it is so not easy just to pick 3 and we should have a few weeks before the new version of WA. :)<br />
      <br />
      And hopefully we can collate them and select the most popular ones for newpicks2. :);)<br />

      14:36:36 &lt;Nic01&gt; 1st preset oughtta be something staying true to AVS, something based on sound<br />
      14:36:44 &lt;Nic01&gt; 2nd oughtta be the more calming, screensaver-type preset<br />
      14:37:07 &lt;Nic01&gt; 3rd oughtta be a mold of the two (DM presets tend to satisfy this)<br />
      <br />
      *ahem*<br />
      What about APEs though?<br />
      <br />
      I suggest a 9-preset system instead of 3, that's a little *too* tight to summarize the world of AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Y'know, if this happens, there will be SO many rips of these presets. If you look at the presets, I've seen tons of rips of the newpicks, the same thing with a couple modifications. The people in charge of removing rips did nothing about it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is a great idea, but maybe you should only put your own X in, because otherwise we gotta go get permission from people. That is, if we want to include it in Winamp5.<br />
      <br />
      Also, let's say no APE use in them. :) Maybe we'll include some<br />
      APEs in the final version, but I dunno...<br />

      <p class="post-content">In order to put in some of the best ones, we will need things like texer, colormap, and convo filter. These are essentials for the best.<br />
      <br />
      My favorites:<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD - Radiant<br />
      fsk - cube<br />
      el-VIS - avsstein remixed<br />
      <br />
      3 just isn't enough!!! I want to put some Jheriko and tuggummi too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If your going to put in some APE's with the release, the following are by far the most useful ones. Nowadays, youll rarely find a preset that doesnt use one of these:<br />
      <br />
      Convulation fliter - Tom Holden<br />
      Color Map - UnConeD<br />
      Texer - UnConeD<br />
      <br />
      There are a few others, less versatile, but still usfull in their own ways:<br />
      <br />
      Channel Shift - UnConeD<br />
      Color Reduction - UnConeD<br />
      Video Delay - Tom Holden (vital APE for live vis-ing)<br />
      Multiplier - Unconed (just an extension of fast brightness, can be replaced by variouse other tools. eg color modifier)<br />
      Multi-Filter - Jheriko (sme as above)</p>

      <p class="post-content">so do I, I almost always use the colormap by now. As for my favourites, I really don't know. I truly love some of the work of fsk, his cube etc. I also liked a lot of UnConeD and Tugg. I really can't tell which are my favourites. Some names:<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD - ants in your pants<br />
      UnConeD - Moonbuggy<br />
      Raz - Satanic<br />
      Jheriko &amp; UnConeD - VJ Chmutov &lt;- this is certainly a top 3 one :)<br />
      Tuggummi - the worm-o-rama series (all of them)<br />
      <br />
      etc. etc. I can't make a selection. There are too much good ones around.<br />
      <br />
      Nobody selected me as their favourite? :( (:p j/k I know I suck) (though I don't like it...., I'll try not to suck)</p>

      <p class="post-content">how boring, why not some exclusive presets instead?<br />
      <br />
      including the APEs would be a good thing, especially those who weren't ever or hardly updated (will there be a bugfixed texer anytime soon?).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm...<br />
      <br />
      I don't have the presets with me, but from my upcoming pack "Extra Dimension" i could probably come up with 2 presets that don't use APE's.<br />
      <br />
      "Cubed to death"<br />
      "Tanssiva Mies 3"<br />
      <br />
      And then maybe as the 3rd preset "Plastic Avenue" from "Innovation!" could be one...<br />
      <br />
      Tho i don't know will they work in the new AVS version, because i haven't tested yet. (i don't want to use wa3/wa5/wa2.9x... :cry: )</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i did take 3 presets from my last packs &amp; upcoming pack and made them APEless (they were easy to make since they had only 1 or 2 ape's per preset)<br />
      <br />
      So here is my 3 presets for the winamp 5 newpicks, they're not exclusive as yathosho there suggested, but they are some of my favorites &amp; best without APE's :)<br />
      <br />
      So here is my X for the permission to use these presets in the newpicks for the wa5 release (that is of course if you want to)</p>

      <br />
      - Multiplier<br />
      - Channel Shift<br />
      - Color Reduction<br />

      <p class="post-content">People, please all remember that the newpicks cannot be hard-to-make presets. All newbies with hardly any or no expierence with AVS who view it the first time have to get the idea 'HEY! I can do this :D'. Without a shitload of simple stuff this won't happen anymore, and the chance on new blood is about zero then. If people really want some heavy-neatlooking stuff, they'll just download the packs from the plugin pages on winamp.com. Though sure there can be some really kickass presets, so they also think 'AVS is endless and superior!'.<br />
      <br />
      Just some of my thoughts. It would just suck so hard when the AVS community would slowly dissapear because people are just frightened to start using something totally new, which can be very, very easy in the beginning.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Daemon: I doubt it. I've been digging around online communities exploring whether or not an influx of advanced work discourages amateurs.<br />
      <br />
      In my experience, most people are simply busy creating stuff for themselves, toying around and enjoying the fact that they are making something, even if the end result is hideous (e.g. check The Sims custom-furniture for a horror show of amateur photoshopping).<br />
      <br />
      The ones that are really into it will soon become more advanced as long as people don't shrug them off too hard (i.e. getting the message across that you can't learn everything in 5 minutes).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah - the newpicks are there to drag them into AVS - you want to amaze them at the 1337n355 of AVS. They will learn on their own - I know I didn't really look at others code until after I had been AVSing for a while - and when I did, I knew to not go for something amazingly advanced.<br />
      <br />
      When people first see AVS, they will immediately go to download more if they really like it. Then they will start experimenting.</p>

      I suggest the top 10 AVS KO Tournament 2 for the newpicks (or the top presets up to that point, in case we don't finish soon enough ;))<br />
      For 2nd edition of newpicks2, probably a sort of AVSers' choice (and admin choice...) of either overall presets or AVS KO Tour 2.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't know if the AVS Tourny 2 would be a good showing of AVS. A lot of people are not participating in it for one thing, and it does show some of AVS's versatility, I don't know if it is an accurate representation of what we can do with this new version of AVS since it is not being used, ie-larger amount of variables, global variables, Color Modifier.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it would be much better if the whole avs community banded together and made a new newpicks from scratch with just one preset from each artist involved in addition to a <b>small</b> collection of existing presets. Before you all boo and crush my idea into dust let me explain my reasoning by way of advantages and disadvantages<br />
      <br />
      <b>Advantages</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>You end up with a wide sample of all of avs, demonstrating many different styles and techniques and showing different levels of technical competence</li>

        <li>Fewer people will hate/be irritated by <b>all</b> of the newpicks</li>

        <li>We could collect a faily large amount of original presets very quickly since everyone only has to make one</li>

        <li>We can show the new effects and capabilities of AVS because every preset will be new and made using the new version of AVS</li>

        <li>First time AVS users (and existing ones possibly) will be exposed to a larger number of avs artists, this makes the community look bigger and better as well as providing users with a fairly good list of names to look up when they want more.</li>

        <li>People won't feel so left out by not getting their presets picked amongst our favorites</li>

        <li>Some of us (I would anyway) may want to make a preset that specifically uses the new features heavily to provide a good example for 'learners' + to show off the power of AVS</li>

        <li>Newer presets tend to better... evolution innit</li>
      </ul><br />
      <b>Disadvantages</b>

      <ul>
        <li>You may end up with a few really bad presets or maybe even a couple of really similar presets</li>

        <li>We wont be able to fill it with lots of Whacko and EL-VIS and such</li>

        <li>We all would need to make an avs preset... I've noticed that I can make a preset in a time range from 30 mins to 30 days, so it could take some time to gather a large collection</li>
      </ul><br />
      If one preset each is a bit extreme then maybe two, plus I think it would be a good idea to get some of the noobs in on this, that way the newnewpicks will appeal to them and us.<br />

      <p class="post-content">This is problematic indeed, i mean how we are going to make the "newpicks" with avs2.7 to the publishing of 2.7 if it is published the first time with the final version of wa5.

      <p class="post-content">I agree to tuggummi. We can't make a newpicks until the final version comes out - by then, we probably won't have time before Winamp 5 comes out and it gets released to the general public.<br />
      <br />
      We need to just go with existing stuff - sure WA5 will have some cool stuff, but it won't make a huge difference in preset quality.<br />
      <br />
      I also have said that we shouldn't make too many presets using 2.7 stuff until the final comes out - that would be a big pain if a lot of stuff got changed.</p>

      <p class="post-content">honestly, just because these presets &lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt; be released with wa5 and avs2.7 doesn't mean that they &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; use the new components.<br />
      <br />
      diversity is probably a great step for new users of winamp, as it would allow people to see the potential of a completely user defined visual program. But while not always the most technical presets, the people over at nullsoft do the best job of diversity. Many of you have already picked a style, and nothing will take you out of it, but the thing is that if i were a new user, i wouldn't want to see 30 something presets of 3D ideas that, for the most part, are rather similiar.<br />
      <br />
      You as a society have placed yourself in a paradigm where everything must use snazzy DM and beyond complicated SSC. Honestly, i don't believe that most of you see the beauty of simplicity, of changing your style to a more conceptual one. There are a few exceptions out there, but for the most part, you focus on the mathmatical pieces rather than realizing that AVS is supposed to be art.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for rambling, but just a thought from someone who's been working with the program for about 4 years now.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well said, HF, but complexity can make even better presets.<br />
      <br />
      There are people who do really simple presets that are awesome, but then some people can make some of the most visually stunning complex presets that I can imagine. Neither is really better, IMO. I am personally better at doing more complex ones - I don't have enough of an artistic touch to make something simple look really nice like some people do. The ones that use crazy code are actually easier for me to make - I have a very mathematical mind.<br />
      <br />
      We should try to get a mix - show the full spectrum of AVS presets.</p>

      I... I can't decide which side to "fall in"... I have enjoyed making 3D presets for my next pack, but at the moment it feels like agony to make those complex things. Sometimes heavy coding is fun (for me this means lots&amp; lots of simple things used together), but i also enjoy making simple things. But i think you have to know atleast some code even to do the conceptual pieces, face it rotoblitter just doesn't do it anymore, it's so boring &amp; monotenous.

      <p class="post-content">well.. ive only really been at it for less than a year.. but the way i work has always been: idea&gt;thought&gt;code (with a whole bunch of pullinmg out hair in the meantime.. sometimes my presets are very simple, because they didnt need to be complex to achieve the original idea. Some use all sorts of crazy junky code, and others are just plain fucked up (the whole unicycle ordeal).<br />
      <br />
      anyways.. my point was something like: lets go with j's idea, and concentrate on making a bunch of presets that show diversity.. demonstrate everyones differnt styles.. and ARNT stupidly complicated just for the sake of looking all geeky and clever. Lets just make some uber presets..<br />

      <p class="post-content">I would think that 2.7 is bound to be backwardly compatible with the pre-releases, even if newer features demanded that the file format change I doubt it would be hard to add back compatibility since it will have to load 2.5 presets too, it makes good sense.</p>

      <p class="post-content">So what is the plan? Do we stick to the original and each post 3 presets with no APE's (except what might be included in). Or do we break apart from this and make our own "newpicks" pack which we then publish outside the actual wa5 release? Or what? :igor: Im so very confused... and scared :eek: :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another idea for the newpicks:<br />
      Let half of them be selected by voting.<br />
      The other half should consist of presets made by artist who are not represted in the first half, so the great presets from the inactive avs'ers will be included (Unconed a.o), and al the best artist are included in the pack, so the most famous styles are represented.<br />
      This will make sure the newnewpicks will be pretty varried and all artist will have a chance to get in the newpicks.<br />
      Good idea?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I think J's idea is best, get one or two presets from everyone except the noobiest of noob noobs, that way everyone will find something they like in the pack, but put a strict deadline on peoples submissions.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I like this Idea</strong><br />
      As a n00bie, I like Jheriko's Idea. I Like the fact that our prests<br />
      (n00bie's) will be in the same pack as the great AVS artists.<br />
      I remeber the names from Winamp2 like 10ne and Justin, and makes me<br />
      happy to know that some day there maybe someone out there that will<br />
      remember my name and other fellow n00bie names. Not to mention, even<br />
      compare us with the greats of AVS. And it will be nice to show the<br />
      different levels of AVS, to show the newcommers that not all of AVS<br />
      is complex equtions, but just your imagination!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Edit: I agree with Jheriko's idea,<br />
      As much as I like Tuggummi and UnConeD's works, I think that chocking it full of 'The Best ever of AVS' will be kind of boring. Plus then what will real beginners have to learn off? The most complicated presets. Insane. Plus, you guys only seem to think that the best are the most technical.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd really appreciate it if this preset made it onto the list somehow. It shows the power of the new AVS quite nicely... actually I could have made this with the old AVS... that last part was just a lie. But it does look damned good... and no, thats NOT max blending.</p>
