      I need someone to make me some graphics, and a couple people to remix presets. I'm not going to post anything here as it's a secret and no one would download it if they realized how shitty it really is (j/k). Is anyone willing to do...anything?<br />
      <br />
      BTW, Karnov, you could be emotional support. And UnConeD can be the midwife.</p>

      <p class="post-content">S_KuPeRs: Screenshots and a couple other graphics. What I need is a good quality screenshot made...I have no experience with graphics programs so I wouldn't know how to get what I wanted out of it. 'A couple other graphics' means a bitmap of my name and my pack name...again, no good graphics program. I want that before I do my screenshots. Basically I want it in red westminster...but with dancing women and fireworks and...a pony. I want a pony. Gimme a pony goddammit!<br />

      I already made the remixes...<br />
      <br />
      As you can clearly see and what might be just <b>slightly</b> obvious i aimed for speed and simplicity in my mixes...<br />
      <br />
      Damn i just noticed i missed Dark Angel last night because of these!!! :mad: :cry:<br />
      <br />
      Oh hell... These work from 7-10 fps with my comp which should mean that they work above the enjoyable 25 fps with your comp... not sure about that though :weird:

      I fixed the Starks Raving preset for you...All it was was the scopes were supposed to be circles, not lines :)<br />
      (and the rotozoomers were fucked up, but since you got rid of 'em (ya bastard ;) ) it's okay)<br />
      <br />
      And now...The moment you've all been waiting for...INSTALLERS! I'm gonna write an installer script right now...Probably going to base it off of jheriko's code, if he doesn't mind, and he doesn't :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">I for one can't wait for it, what I've already seen is good. Hopefully this pack will go down well and raise your standing in the community, you have done some nice coding and some good effects.<br />
      <br />
      Also I can release some leet 4-d geometry once I get some fast code down for the 4-d shadow matrix with a moving light source. ;) Maybe even make a 4-d julia set cutthrough if I'm feeling really clever, even if it runs at 0.1 fps. :P<br />
      <br />
      Nice to see people using my script, I think its much better than those ones with message boxes asking you to choose winamp 2 or 3.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, good luck with the release and everything.</p>
