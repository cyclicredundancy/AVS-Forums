I think that coding that cube was more about knowing some programing stuff, using that "or" checking all around ( :D )... IMHO this is actually the simplest way of making the cube. :rolleyes: I just felt that I have to make a cube using SuperScope, and I didn't want to give up! :p<br><br>And btw., I added that water/blur/seizure crap only because I didn't want to upload just a plain boring cube, but I believe I would have came up with something more sofisticated if I just worked on it a little... :D For example, check this cute motion that I accidentally came up with:<br>d=1/sin(3.14159265359*d)*asin(d) (Check "Blend" and "Bilinear filtering".)<br>It looks really cool with some water and blur added, but I'm pretty sure you'll come up with something better. :D There's an example in the zip file I just sent (Yeah, it's bulls**t... :blah: )</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th May 2005 22:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">You have used up your smiley limit for the month doccolinni, if you post any more replies containing smilies I will be forced to contact unconed who will delete your account.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">doccolinni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th May 2005 23:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by PAK-9</i><br><b>You have used up your smiley limit for the month doccolinni, if you post any more replies containing smilies I will be forced to contact unconed who will delete your account.</b></blockquote>Hunh...?</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th May 2005 23:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sarcasm" target="_blank">sarcasm</a><br><br>We don't use a lot of smileys here..
