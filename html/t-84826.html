      <p class="post-content"><strong>direct3d ape?</strong><br />
      hey friend do you think it'd be possible to make an ape (like an effect list) that outputs the visual from 3d hardware<br />
      <br />
      and a way to reduce colors in it (or anything to incrase the speed of hungry presets) in it<br />
      <br />
      yeah i was thinking about an ape using 8bf files from adobe photoshop and pals to make fxs like false 3d , 360 rotation , chrome , (and cloning from others like hot wax coating ((((ok and using a comm to reduce quality to incerase speed))))<br />
      <br />
      an ape to make transparencity fading and move edges over edges to remove ugly lines un ddm rb and zooming purpose parts<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      !!!!!!!!!!!!!hey budddies..who did ask to get sourcecodes from avs...for what purpose! ape's been created!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      héhé so that's it.....<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>the buffers/blending</strong><br />
      is there any way to make an alternative to effect list or to buffer save to make a chosen color being blended..like completely avoided...<br />
      cause i think that evry parts of avs can be converted to ape and then being modified<br />
      <br />
      in another post i made i asked for this...i got some answers..but didn't realy satisfy me cause there is always some pixels half blended and the rest is transparent(the good part)<br />
      so i can't realy get the little flyin fairie to be all opaque (even if i use no fairie:confused:)<br />
      <br />
      so it'd be great to make an ape that tells &lt;&lt;hey the machine , remove this color and make it transparent or hey avs take this color and give it some alphablending , and do nothing to the rest&gt;&gt;<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      i did find an excelent slideshowmaker ape that takes jpg..<br />
      <br />
      if there were an ape that simply use gif with transparent colorcode<br />
      or png with simple tansparentcode it'd mayby do the job great<br />
      but the first alternative would mayby help elsewere...like in presets like cartoon from unconed......<br />
      <br />
      you'd take an effect list with movin particles/rotto blitter/water/buffer save then another effect list with<br />
      with cartoon effect, then aply the ape to one color or two (hum mayby usin the color gradian inside fractal fx (like the one in photoshop when making a gradian with a form like left to right /square/circle)<br />
      <br />
      huh and you there can chose 2 or 3 colors to become transparent<br />
      <br />
      (ok here there is the option of buffer save and/or effect list to be modified as an evolved ape<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      so here i send what i've made upon now to understand how to works with tools i have<br />
      <br />
      sorry to explain so badly.....i'm kinda stressed out and i made a white night too......i'm stressed cause i'm gona be a vj if i can show a bit more of quality to my talents (if i got any talent)<br />
      <br />
      so priv msg me if you find any better synthax the 180 (minutes or hour i don't remember)after i wrote</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm working on an AVS-script compiler and intend to release it as public domain here if I ever get it to work. That enough? :)<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I took a quick look at your code and noticed it's quite inefficient. Here are a few ideas:<br />
      * RGBFilter:<br />
      - Why don't you calculate the mask in realtime? Simply do something like:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>int mask = (0xFF &amp;&amp; enabled1) || (0xFF00 &amp;&amp; enabled2) || (0xFF0000 &amp;&amp; enabled3);</code>
</pre>That should reduce your code by about 95%.<br />
      - Why are you putting everything in fbout[]? You could just as well do the modifications to framebuffer[] itself, because there is no dependancy between the pixels.<br />
      <br />
      * ScreenReverse<br />
      - The pos() method is called twice for every pixel in the image, which means an immense slowdown. Replace it with a macro:<br />
      #define pos(a,b,c) ((a)+(b)*(c))<br />
      The compiler will replace every instance of pos() with the real code, which means that there is no extra function call per pixel, but you still get nice code.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Also, if you want fast APE's, you need to use assembly and MMX in critical routines. It's already very slow :) For example, here's the critical code for my Color-reduction APE:<br />
      <pre>
<code><br />/* render */<br />        int a,b,c;<br />        a = 8-config.levels;<br />        b = 0xFF;<br />        while (a--) b=(b&lt;&lt;1)&amp;0xFF;<br />        b |= (b&lt;&lt;16) | (b&lt;&lt;8);<br />        c = w*h;<br />        int a,b,c;<br />        a = 8-config.levels;<br />        b = 0xFF;<br />        while (a--) b=(b&lt;&lt;1)&amp;0xFF;<br />        b |= (b&lt;&lt;16) | (b&lt;&lt;8);<br />        c = w*h;<br />        __asm {<br />                mov ebx, framebuffer;<br />                mov ecx, c;<br />                mov edx, b;<br />                lp:<br />                sub ecx, 4;<br />                test ecx, ecx;<br />                jz end;<br />                and dword ptr [ebx+ecx*4], edx;<br />                and dword ptr [ebx+ecx*4+4], edx;<br />                and dword ptr [ebx+ecx*4+8], edx;<br />                and dword ptr [ebx+ecx*4+12], edx;<br />                jmp lp;<br />                end:<br />        }<br />        return 0;<br />/* end render */<br /></code>
</pre><br />
      This might seem weird at first, but it's actually pretty tight code. It takes advantage of the fact that AVS's imagewidth is always divisable by 4, to do 4 pixels in one cycle. This means only 1/4th the amount of jumps.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, mucks: it's not possible to make Effect List APE's. APE's can only behave like a misc, trans or render.

      Has anybody gotten the AVS Video Capture APE to work right? I got it to work with my crappy IBM PC Camera, but it made my FPS crawl at like 1 or 2 fps. I haven't been able to get it working with any other cameras or capture devices because they don't support 32 bit mode. Perhaps somebody could improve the APE. I think the original coder abandoned the project, but he might be willing to give up the source code.<br />

      I'd be willing to help, but my C++ is pretty limited. If I can get the source code from the original author I will post it to this forum.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>maybe try another one...</strong><br />
      I know there are more than one video input APE and some work better than others...I don't use it at the moment, but a friend do, I'll ask him to send it to me and I'll post it here...Hope this will help<br />
      <br />
      Note: I basically come from Visual Basic world and my C++ knowledge is limited too ( the APEs I made are my first C++ programming attempt), so why don't you try it too ? :D</p>

      do you really know "well" VC++ ???? It can't just compile to exe but also dll...and ape is a sort of dll (not really but...), just go here to download my sources : <a href="http://vfxsoftwares.fr.st" target="_blank">http://vfxsoftwares.fr.st</a> and open the dsw files with "open workspace" in visual c++, compile and OOOHHHHHH :eek:!!!!!! It compile to an APE :eek:</p>

      I'd like to develop an APE to render animated GIFs (with size, positioning, transparent colors and so on...),but as my C++ knowledge is limited for now (thanks again UncoNeD for the tips you gave me:)), I'd like someone serious to help me when I'm having problems...Can someone join this project please ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey goebish, it would be very useful if you could add a version resource to your APEs. though it might be unlikely you will still update them, it'd allow a proper installation (checking for up-to-date versions).</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok, i noticed i wrote some bs before. however, it's still true that the filedate is very unreliable to determine the version. using a checksum would be more reliable, but the installer had to know the checksum for every installer. so, the version resource remains the best way. i'm pretty sure that every guide to coding would mention these as proper standards anyway and i don't see a need to act like a rebel (you are just lazy!).</p>

      </blockquote>I get your point about the file date/time being unreliable but its better than nothing. Maybe fallback to date/time if the version is absent?<br />
      <br />
      As for version resources being good practice... the version resource system is a hacky pile of crap of its own. The real coder's solution is to get the information from the PE header like Windows does... whether or not there is a suitable API for doing this though is another matter entirely. I'm sure that has something to do with the general crappiness of versions in executable code. Rather than solve the problem MS devoted their attention to their horrible WinSxS / .NET assembly system.<br />
      <br />
      It's all very backwards... "DLL hell" is only an issue if you suck at writing DLLs and programs to begin with. IMO there is nothing for MS to fix, except maybe the crappiness of their PE/COFF implementation which:<br />
      (O/S side)<br />
      * isn't consistent across the different flavours of Windows (a "do nothing" executable that runs on XP may not run on Vista)<br />
      * doesn't conform to the actual PE/COFF specs<br />
      * doesn't conform to their own PE/COFF specs<br />
      * isn't accurately documented anywhere (that I've found)<br />
      * isn't necessarily used as the source of information for .exe properties sheet<br />
      * doesn't come with an API to use it<br />
      (compiler side)<br />
      * doesn't grumble if there is missing information (i.e. no version)<br />
      * doesn't check the validity of values<br />
      * imposes more restrictions than either version of the standard or the implementation require<br />
      <br />
      I went off on a bit of a tangent there... but the relevant point to this discussion is that the PE could provide a checksum AND a version if it wasn't implemented by MS monkeys.

      <p class="post-content">While we're talking about detecting versions.. Can PB somehow detect the AVS version in the same, or some other way?<br />
      <br />
      If it could, the installer could prevent installing Video Delay and [the other pre-installed one, convo filter?], if the current AVS version also includes those effects, or even remove those (unwanted) duplicates</p>

      <p class="post-content">pimpbot already disables the sections for those apes in during setup. however, the user can override this and install the APEs anyway. in that case and extra question will bother the user, default action set to no overwrite. pimpbot also warns the user if an APE with version resource is newer than the one included the installer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">afaik videodelay is circulating around in two different names. pimpbot uses <i>delay.ape</i> since day one, but maybe that's a mistake.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't have a delay.ape in my \avs folder, but I can use video delayin my presets. I just installed delay.ape there (for testing), there are two instances now.<br />
      <br />
      Don't know when it was added, but my guess would be ever since 2.81b.</p>
