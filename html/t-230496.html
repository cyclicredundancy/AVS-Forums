      dunno if it's <b>exactly</b> what you were looking for. also I'm currently into reworking the camera movement and scopes, so maybe in a few days/weeks there could be a better, new version!</p>

      Hey hope you dont mind but I did a remix combining pak9's starfield and tweaked your wormhole here is what i got. Grandchild one question how do I change the color of the wormhole to a rotating color scheme purple blue ect..?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah i also think that this starfield fits a bit better to that preset. But what i don't like is that the x-rotation of the new starfield is in opposite to the rotation of the wormhole. I think it'd be much better when they rotated the same way along all three axes...</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm...<br />
      pak's starfield is definitely better than mine, but do you really want that texer-light-point to stay there in the middle?? it looks a bit odd.<br />
      And same with the rotation like ^..^ said.<br />
      set "croty" to <b>-</b>reg03 in pak's starfield, that should solve that.<br />
      for the color look into the pixel box of the body scopes. there is the lighting [named "col"], and the red, blue and green values which all three take up the "col" value, whereas red is modified by the current distance of the point from the center "d".<br />
      To change the colors, just create a global variable for red, blue and green. delete all the body scopes but one. make your changes by modifying red, blue and green and duplicate the scope until you have the desired amount of them. no individual scope setting needed. the position increment is already in the scopes.<br />

      <p class="post-content">oh man! you screwed up my global code a little:<br />
      I readded "speed = (gettime(0)-t)*20;" to the 1st line,<br />
      and "hw = h+w;" to the 3rd line<br />
      of the global SSC because they keep the speed fps-independent and the linesize somewhat resolution-independent. If you want thinner lines modify "reg97" labelled "// tube linesize offset" and/or "reg95" for the thingies<br />
      <br />
      also there were some empty bulges going through because you [accidentally?] deleted 2 thingy SSCs. fixed that now.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise cool edits so far! I'll make it better beyond nagging on mistakes really soon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">all right, your welcome!<br />
      thanks from my side too, for helping me find yet a better version of this preset.<br />
      <br />
      and sorry for keeping you busy: But I polished up the code up a bit more [esp. pak's starfield, now it pauses along with the rest on pausing the music] AAAAAAND added a code-internal color modification right in the beginning of the global scope's frame box [labelled accordingly] which can adjust both the light color and the warphole color!<br />
      <br />
      my current coloring is:<br />
      reg41 = 1; reg42 = .5;<br />
      reg43 = 1; reg44 = .7;<br />
      reg45 = .3; reg46 = .5;<br />
      <br />
      the old plain purple coloring is:<br />
      reg41 = 1; reg42 = .5;<br />
      reg43 = 1; reg44 = .7;<br />
      reg45 = <b>1</b>; reg46 = .5;<br />
      <br />
      maybe you can advise the user to access this possibility. not very userfriendly let alone dumbass-proof but better than nothing i think.<br />

      <p class="post-content">that's nice ASD5A!<br />
      I thought about two vertical lines for hue and sat on each side. one side [á 2 lines/drawers/selectors] for the light color, one for the warphole color. just what i thought I'd do and since it's mine, maybe you could do it like that? :) I mean you definitely don't have to do it that way, just as a proposal...<br />
      I tried to excerpt the hue/sat to RGB converting algos myself from "stringtheory" but couldn't. [btw have you received my remixes???]</p>

      <p class="post-content">customer's king ;) so what do you want, I could offer either:<br />
      - smaller,<br />
      - lenghthened,<br />
      - shortened,<br />
      - size oscilloscope reactive balls, or<br />
      - balls that are oscilloscopes itself [jittering a bit to sound input],<br />
      - a different color,<br />
      - flashy colors,<br />
      - morphing colors,<br />
      - no user color [sorry but that would mean another two bars, and imo cramming up the preset to much],<br />
      - a color according to the wormhole<br />
      <br />
      pick some of these, it's all done in a minute.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Finally!!!</strong><br />
      well, I said 1/2 an hour, but in the end it turned out to be 5 of them ;) [since our band-rehearsal didn't take place], and this makes 5 AVS-<b>seconds</b>, you know!<br />
      <br />
      so here it is, let's move on to the<br />
      <br />
      changes:<br />
      - removed useless EL's,<br />
      - changed name to "Vortex" [I think that's the name you wanted QuadHelix?] and mentioned ASD there,<br />
      - moved onscreen check in global SSC [you hid that reg51 well, asd! I had to find it with the help of a text editor search! ts,ts, somewhere in the 3d rotation in the global code at the end of a line... :)],<br />
      - moved both global hsl to rgb trans to the end of the global SSC's frame box,<br />
      - added strg -&gt; interface on/off function [for better fullscreen looks],<br />
      - added random color combo on init,<br />
      - added shift -&gt; random color combo,<br />
      - added right mouse button support,<br />
      - added [tip from hboy] reassigning regs in the frame box before the use in the px-box [only body SSCs], minor speedup,<br />
      - added weird code joke in the TexerII ;),<br />
      - interface has the same relative size on all widths now,<br />
      - interface speedup: SSC's and TexerII have n=0 when interface not visible,<br />
      - modified beat balls [hopefully to your satisfaction, QuadHelix though w/o morphing colors [better imho]],<br />
      - aspect ratio correction is now the same in the wormhole and the starfield,<br />
      - changed comment a bit [added credits &amp; explanations],<br />
      - labelled which code is whose [loosely],<br />
      - selected colors are displayed on the wormhole now!!! according to this weird matrix:<br />
      r = 1-r;<br />
      g = 1-b;<br />
      b = 1-g;<br />
      to be found in the global SSC's hsl to rgb trans code [both times!]<br />
      <br />
      what I did not change:<br />
      - the camera movement still sucks.<br />
      <br />
      I didn't make it an .exe since ASD5A might want to add something [although I don't think so since I think it's, err... &lt;understatement&gt;<br />
      <font size="3">quite nice!</font><br />
      &lt;/understatement&gt;<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      hope you're pleased too,<br />

      <p class="post-content">Looks great! yes this will do very very nicely I thank you guys so much. ask and i recieved wow.<br />
      <br />
      love that random generator!<br />
      what does strg mean? Ya the camera doesnt look that good but its ok.<br />
      <br />
      now all we have to do is pak it in exe if one of you can do that for me i would be happy.<br />
      <br />
      Again the Vortex team says thank you. We Will put your credits on the main download screen of the skin and we can submit this to pluggins.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thx asd, it's been nice from my side too :)!<br />
      <br />
      but wasn't that the discussion on #avs? if it's hsb or hsl?<br />
      <br />
      /me wikis...<br />
      <br />
      oh you're right, there are 3 names for color spaces:<br />
      hsb + hsv [synonyms] and<br />
      hsl.<br />
      <br />
      so it's hsb/hsv in the end. changed that and finished comment [I wanted to thank QuadHelix but forgot to finish the post scriptum :rolleyes:]<br />
      <br />
      oh and asd, could you do the exe part, I don't have NSIS [and thus Pimpbot] on this comp [don't wanna dl it now, wanna bed ;)] and this comp's floppy drive is b0rked so I would have to burn it in order to get it to my comp... forth and back again! :cry:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not really, AVS scene just is a bit different i guess. In skinning terms you might compare a one preset publish to a skin that only changes the main-window, equalizer and playlist, nothing else. It's just not worth publishing one preset alone, no matter how good it is.</p>

      <p class="post-content">thanks Tug, I get it. Anyway I still think its a great one. I did publish other paks here that had multiple AVS in em they got better ratings. And by the Way The Name should be Skin Consortium not my name Ralph Barber error on my part I hope a moderator can change it.<br />
