      A new version of our motion detection APE is avalible to download. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=144415" target="_blank">See here for the old thread</a>)<br />
      <br />
      Now works with Winamp 2! :D<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.syfi.co.uk/" target="_blank">:winamp: <font size="4">Go get it here!</font> :winamp:</a><br />
      <br />
      Here are some screenshots of the new version in Winamp 2:<br />
      <br />

      <br />
      We are also thinking about those of you who don't own a WebCam. It is possible to have other inputs into iJenAPE. We are discussing the idea of having the AVS itself as an input; Detecting any motion in the layers below it. ;) This may be included in later versions.<br />

      </blockquote>Hi Jaheckelsafar,<br />
      Cheers man :)<br />
      <br />
      However, I'm sorry, but we can't help you at all it you only give us this little information ...<br />
      <br />
      Can you give us more?<br />
      A mail to <a href="mailto:APE.bugs@syfi.co.uk">APE.bugs@syfi.co.uk</a> would be great.<br />
      Your OS, version of Winamp, DirectX version, system hardware spec (ie, processor, memory), what happened, the error message, you webcam model, and anything else ...<br />
      <br />
      The more you can help with these bugs (everybody!) the better this little baby will become ;) Seriously, it's out there now and we want to get this as tight as possible ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">He posted in the other iJenAPE thread that your webcam should indeed have RGB 24 bit color depth as output source, otherwise the APE wouldn't work. I dunno if this problem is being solved, but if your webcam doesn't support RGB24, than you probably just have to wait till other input sources are aviable, like most of us :p.</p>

      </blockquote>Hi UnConeD,<br />
      heh, we've got a CS430 here and it only supports I420 and IYUV!!! not an RGB setting in sight!<br />
      <br />
      We are looking at supporting RGB8 and RGB32 in the very near future :) but unless you haven't got one of the three settings ... sorry. We're not really developing the feed source (hence the I_Source file), just working more on Jen directly.<br />
      <br />
      We went out and picked up 2-3 random cheap'n'nasty (£15!) cameras and they all worked :)<br />
      <br />
      As for the crash, yeah, sorry about that, it'll be fixed soon, for version 2 (maybe sooner ...)<br />
      <br />
      And finally, we only found 1 instance of Winamp3 in the Winamp2 installer, could you elaborate please?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Supporting RGB32 should be trivial (and indeed preferred because it doesn't need conversion to AVS), but I doubt RGB8 is used anywhere.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure you can find some YUV420/I420 conversions through Google though. Also, I think it would be nice to have a pass-through setting that skips the motion detection thingy altoghether (sorry to say this, but it looks pretty crappy on the screenshots IMO).</p>

      </blockquote>Hi,<br />
      RGB32 is indeed no 'real' issue other than we have to code it for the camera (and we just ain't got the time right now) and 8bit data is for faster 'grey-scale' only operations, if we should ever need them.<br />
      <br />
      Again with the other formats, it's stuff we want to do but just do not have the time yet, and we're kinda hoping others might provide solutions when the library gets released :)<br />
      <br />
      Can you clarify what you mean about the 'pass-through' idea. We're not entirely sure what you're getting at? And yeah, the screen shots don't do the system justice, but we're not AVS Preset developers and are hoping it's you guys that'll work your magic with the APE :)<br />

      It is our plan to look at other feed sources, though it's the engine we're really working on.<br />
      <br />
      If the device has a WDM Device Driver, and supports RGB24, it should, in theory, work fine :)<br />

      i love the ape.<br />
      p.s.s.<br />
      i do have one suggestion for you. maybe you should make a version that allows the user to set control points and allows the ape to detect certain values and makes a special effect for said value. heck maybe even make it write to a megabuf or somethin. or try making it have dynamaic movement like abilitys so you can program effects that the ape can render directly on the image being rendered.</p>

      When we were training some of our new developers in our technlogy we gave them our training engine called iJen.<br />
      <br />
      iJen is given to our new developers that join us, it is not powerful at all, iJen is basic and simple and gives developers an easy learning curve on how to create interactive applications and games before developers move up and use our bigger professional interactive development engine Plato (Plato is used in many commercial systems that are on the market today, but you wouldnâ€™t know that it our technology behind powering it).<br />
      <br />
      We set a few of our new developers the APE project as it was a good way of them learning how to implement and embed our technology into a commercial application. We never realised how popular it would actually be. in total I think we have had in excess of 250,000 downloads.<br />
      <br />
      So now you know that we created the APE as a training exercise.<br />
