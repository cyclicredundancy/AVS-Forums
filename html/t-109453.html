      <p class="post-content">Usually z is used for the z axis. It just makes sence. :p<br />
      <br />
      It's used to make things shrink or grow depending on how close they are to the viewing plane.<br />
      <br />
      Because it's a user defined variable you have to reset it for each point.<br />
      <br />
      Help any?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's anything you want it to be. The z-axis thing is used like this:<br />
      x1=...;<br />
      y1=...;<br />
      z1=...;<br />
      z=z1+dst;<br />
      x=x1/z;<br />
      y=y1/z;<br />
      <br />
      That'll give you the proper projection for most any shape you want to do (unless it diverges). dst is the distance from the center to the point farthest away from the center. For example, in a cube the farthest point is going to be &lt;1,1,1&gt; (the corner where x=1, y=1, and z=1). So the distance is sqrt(1^2+1^2+1^2)=sqrt(1+1+1)=sqrt(3).</p>

            </blockquote>How can you not know how to use a user defined variable or what it is? The whole point of a user defined variable is that you decide how to use it and you decide what it is and what it does. (Sorry I couldn't find a way to say that without it sounding a bit harsh...) That makes it sound like you think they are predefined to some extent, otherwise your question makes no sense.<br />
            <br />
            I assume that you understand that t=t+0.05; just increases t by 0.05 every frame (if it is in the frame box). With z, you just have to define it for all of the points, either by making it the same across the frame or by setting it to be different for each point by using 'i' in someway or by using a different method.<br />
            <br />
            Don't forget that you can define (almost) any number of variables and do practically whatever you want with them.

        <p class="post-content">Ok, idiot, I'll try to put it into Milkdrop terms for you:<br />
        <br />
        z variables, usually more then 1, are simply placeholders for values later put into large equations to generate 3d movements... such as shrinking the wave when it gets "further away" (it just gets smaller).<br />
        <br />
        No one can five you the equations cause they'll always be different.. if you want the conversion equations.. well.. you have them already as you sent them to me.</p>
