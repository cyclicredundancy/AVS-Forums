I chose to demonstrate the mathematical application of Winamp Advanced Visualization Studio, and found a partner that learned quite well (well, I had to teach myself, then I made lessons for him. We kind of were in a mad dash to get both of us up to decent superscopes &amp; movements)<br><br>Although I couldn't do that project until we had extra time at the end of the year, I still think it was encouraging to some people to give them an insanely cool way to use math-for AVS! I don't think I'll have time tonight to look at your presets (I have a terrible cold-I even have a fever b/c of it--so I'll need my rest to get over it).<br><br>--C.

But that's always a part of AVS packs; some people may not like certain presets while others love them. The ones I liked the most were SpaceraceR, Electric Kool Aid Acid Quiz, Last Trip to Nowhere, Pulsing Thing of Something or Other with Stars &amp; Stuff, WurmZ (The Revenge), Newcleus I, Newcleus III. My favorite out of the Newcleus presets would have to be the Newcleus V. I also liked the effect of the movement in KeleyedaskopE. My favorite superscope preset out of the bunch is Å¡berscopE 4k (I'm aware some of the others may have been more complicated) but it's just my personal preference :)<br><br>One suggestion for the Newcleus presets: you might try tinkering with different movement combinations<br><br>Overall, I think you did a nice job. :)<br><br>--C.
