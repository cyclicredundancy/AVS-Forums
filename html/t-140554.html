      <p class="post-content">Very Good Atero, but I didn't really like your fading/smoothness - it was a bit crude (too many jagged edges), and some were a little plain. Neon Dreams just showed a white screen with a few dots at the beginning, because the texer wasn't selected in the box and attached to the preset.<br />
      <br />
      Other than that, the scopes and DMs and stuff were incredible. I'm jealous. :p<br />

      <p class="post-content">In the installer, I selected "Install to Winamp3 w/ extras" and nothing else. I didn't do anything custom. So it should have worked, but it didn't. I got the texer, but it wasn't selected in the box. Isn't that something <b>you</b> have to do? I don't get how it worked for everyone else though. Oh well. :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      By fading/smoothness I mean presets like "Fingerpaint" Which actually looks a little n00bish in my opinion. I just don't like that style very much (using fadeout on mps and stuff). And maybe less black screen too - sorry I can't explain much of this very well. Not all your presets are like that though. You still have a very nice pack.</p>

      Some I relly liked, some I didn't. Flock was my favourite. Brian's Brain my least. I never really did like the automata presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pixelcraft...1: you're using winamp3, of course there's going to be problems; 2: it's the first revision of the installer, i'd have expected you'd be smart enough to have checked to make sure you were installing everything correctly before you did so (but as I said, you're using winamp3, so what do I know :rolleyes: ) Anyhow, I'll look into selecting it from the menu, .onSelChange is a fuggin bitch...you never know when it's gonna be called :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would have made a comment earlier, but I've been out of town. Anyway, excellent pack! Technically, it's awesome (as usual) and pushes the bar even further for AVS. The real improvement over your first two packs, though, is the visual aspect of it. Your color style has always been bright colors that encompass the whole spectrum, but until now they didn't always blend together so well. But with this pack you've got it just about perfect, as far as color is concerned. And I'm sure that was tricky to do, as anyone can make a combination of, say, half the spectrum look good. But to use all the colors and still look great is something this is pretty hard to do right. I think my favorite preset would have to be Cubism II.<br />
      <br />
      On another note, you said something about NSIS scripting in your first preset. Well, I'm trying to get a decent installer for "Energy", but I really don't know what the hell I'm doing. Here's what I have so far, which is based off of jherico's script. I <i>think</i> it has some kind of instdir detection in it, but I don't know if it works right. The checkboxes are screwy though. Also, I'm pretty sure this is coded in an older version of NSIS, as I had to download an old version for it to compile right. If you can take a look at it and give me a couple of tips for fixing that checkbox, updating it to the newest version of NSIS, or whatever, that would be awesome. If you don't have time, that's alright, I'll probably figure it out myself eventually.</p>
