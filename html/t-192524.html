      Hi everyone!:D<br />
      <br />
      OK, I'm making a new preset and I need people's feedback before I continue on. This one is only a basic version just to get an idea of what it will be like.<br />
      I would like to know exactly what you think about the dyna-move, ssc, convo-filter, etc...<br />
      Also, what should I do about any coloring?</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's ok... i don't think that special looking ssc matters with that dm infront of it. try and slow it down a bit and get more solid lines - and more contrast.<br />
      As for colours, use some unique tones and inverts, multifilters and chanelshifts and it'll look sweet!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm... You know I think you're right!<br />
      I changed the scc to a straight line, and it looks clearer, however I have to use a HUGE linesize (24/32) for it to even show up.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Opacity Mask for the Digital Components</strong><br />
      I created a mask for the microchip and resistor so that they no longer appear to be behind the circuit board lines.<br />
      <br />
      There may be an easier way to do this, but here is how I created the mask.<br />
      <br />
      1. Duplicate the effect list containing the object you wish to make a mask for.<br />
      2. Set the Output Blending of the original effect list to Subtractive 1.<br />
      3. Change the colors of everything in the original effect list to white. Now you will have a perfectly opaque black mask.<br />
      4. To sync up the movement of your two effect lists replace local variables with global variables, e.g., reg00, reg01 ...<br />
      <br />
      I did this seperately for both the microchip and resistor. I then moved the two resistor effect lists to the bottom of the main box so that the resistor would always be on top of the microchip. And then, just being silly, I added the intel text to the microchip.</p>

      <p class="post-content">A much quicker way of doing that is:<br />
      <br />
      &lt;Effect List / output: subtractive 1&gt;<br />

      - Buffer - Save - Replace blend<br />

      <ul>
        <li>smoothed out the rotations of the objects</li>

        <li>made the background layout change and the objects change directions every random number of beats ( around &gt;75 ) OR when you press the ALT key</li>

      <p class="post-content">Hehe :)<br />
      That's from other people's contributions. We have over done the filename.<br />
      Also, I noticed something that needed to be changed: if you load the preset with no music playing it will keep switching randomly (as if the alt key were always pressed, due to me not initializing a variable). So here it is again, with a shorter name.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Raz. I'm glad there is a much simpler way to create a mask. I found that if you set the Multiplier to infinite root, as you suggested, that it creates a thin black border around the masked objects. This is sort of nice with Digital Chaos's AVS since it creates more contrast between the components and the background. If that line isn't desired though, then it seems you still have to create a seperate all white mask as I did.<br />
      <br />
      Digital Chaos, one of the bands on your resistor was black. That band is now transparent. It seems the Multiplier doesn't multiply black. It probably tries to multiply by zero and just gets zero again, rather than moving toward white. Change that band to another color, and it will become opaque.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This is sweet :D<br />
      I changed the colors on the resistor so some weren't transparent. Also, I made them alternate a green color on beat.<br />

      <p class="post-content">That's the thing, I'm still new so I really don't know what I should do to optimize it. But it's pretty good for being thrown together this weekend imo.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah that's all fine and dandy, but there's no movement of the chips(which there is only one of now) and the tracks aren't gold and don't move either. but nice dm anyway PAK-9.<br />
      Soon the only thing Digital Chaos would have made in this preset is the comment :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know :cry:<br />
      But look at all this code I get to play with now. :D<br />
      I noticed that too about the lines not moving, they're not <b>golden</b>, they objects don't move, and the transistor doesn't flash green on beat.<br />
      <br />
      Without my dm the presets nothin' hehe...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sheesh you people are never happy. I made it like that because the frame rate takes a big hit when the texture is active.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, better,(i get 17.2 fps at 500x350) but still not quite there. frankly i feel it doesn't need a 3d dm - not saying it doesn't look good, infact it looks sweet, but i just don't think it suits this preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just like stuffing things into 3D, I wasnt suggesting you actually use this as the preset. Although I do reccommend you adopt some of the optimisations from my previous post.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I kind of agree with you on that one, a 3d dm isn't for this one.<br />
      [edit] ...although, 3d AV's are <i>really</i> awesome [/edit]</p>

      <p class="post-content">I started on this one earlier today. I know this one doesn't have any trippy visuals or anything, I just want to know what you think of the code.<br />
      <br />
      Things in the preset:<br />
      A clock in the upper right corner stays almost accurate (not to the actual time of day, just the movement of a clock). Right now a single vertical bar uses the variable 'v' to get the value of the sound, but I'm going to make a spectrum analyzer and use getspec. A simple horizontal oscilloscope is at the bottom. I use render/text to show the current track name and play time. Nothing too great.</p>
