      <p class="post-content">1) zip is popular and supported on WinXP by default<br />
      2) avs presets are so small you don't need the more "powerful" compression technique of what other formats than zip provide.<br />
      3) a lot of people (me included) will want to keep their computers &amp; programms simple &amp; clean and can't be arsed to install one extra application just to see a couple of avs presets.<br />
      <br />
      So go "mainstream", otherwise you won't get anyone to watch your presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">@ skull, you can f off and die like the rest of the people who post the obvious (and nothing usefull whatsoever) in these (my avs posting threads) by saying just like every single other person who looks at em that i'm a noob (at making presets, and no i have no idea about the math/programming part of it), and yes it is obvious (or so is the opinion shoved down my damn throat lately) SINCE I HAVE TO KEEP TELLING YOU ARSEHOLE'S EVERYTIME I MAKE A NEW DAMN PRESET</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm, the term n00b means newbie, rookie, unexperienced, you could know loads of math and still considered as a bad avser if you can't do nothing useful with it. i.e. you make a super cool superscope, but don't know what effects could go along with it.<br />
      <br />
      I too hate the fact that n00b means "doesn't know how to code" around here at the wa forums. If you understand what every avs effect does and what the different blend modes do and understand buffer saving you can go pretty far with that already. Add some simple coded dm's like shifting, zooming &amp; rotation and you'll be surprised how much you can do with them already! It's just up to how well you understand how the different effects work together :)<br />
      <br />
      But here is where we come to your presets, they are simple there is no way around it. They also look unclean and by that i mean there seems to be too much stuff going around. Also they give the impression that you didn't know even what you were doing to the preset, looks like you just added stuff until it looked "ok" to you.<br />
      <br />
      Pay no attention to these forum people, most of them don't think your nothing unless you know tons of code, and it is a fact that most of them also don't know nothing else but code.<br />
      <br />
      So my advice is that learn how the different effects work and what does what, then you can move into coding, because even though coding without the knowledge of how avs works is nothing, also knowing how avs works without any code doesn't get you very far at all.<br />

      <p class="post-content">thnx tuggumi, it's nice to see at least one person here does something other than simply jump on the 'it sucks' bandwagon and say the presets suck without giving any kind of advice/suggestion's.<br />
      and i think(hope) these are looking better as i'm posting new one's i've never really touched the editor before my recent presets, and i don't really know what i'm doing....<br />
      sooo bear with me and hopefully these will start looking good sometime :D</p>
