This gives me either three seperate desktops, or one "clone desktop (same on monitor and tv and one secondary desktop.<br><br>I'm running windows 98se and winamp 2.78.<br><br>Yeasterday, this setup was working fine. I would open winamp on my secondary display, go to display--&gt; overlay in the settings, set it to black (desktop colors) and the avs window running on my secondary display would be overlayed back onto BOTH primary displays.<br><br>This worked with both of the primary monitors at the same time, not anymore though. I was trying to see how the fullscreen overlaymode worked cause I haven't played with it much, and, when I went back to try to use the overlay, It wouldn't show up on my other two monitors. I fooled with the setting and got it to show on the tv only when I shut off the monitor on the pci card.<br><br>Some might say no problem but HEY! I want both of them showing the overlay!<br><br>Anyways, I checked the forums, and it was all working fine before and I didn't even have the multi-monitor support checked.<br><br>I really don't know where to fix this, I've looked everywhere, and now I turn to you, my fellow users.<br><br>PLEASE help me to get it working the way it did again, It was so SWEEEET!<br><br>Sorry guys, wrote this early in the morning for me and left some stuff out.<br><br>I've been using AVS for a while and more or less know what I'm doing. I've tried both with and without multi-monitor support enabled, all color depths/resolutions.<br><br>basically it worked before I played with the fullscreen overlay mode and now I can't get it to work again.<br><br>Thanks ahead of time...<br><br>Kurt</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2002 15:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">&lt;bows respectfully out of the way of people more knowledgable than he&gt;</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2002 15:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Not to mention the fact that few people have a dual monitor + tv setup at home :).

After figuring out that I could use both, I found that I could display my avs's on the secondary display and manipulate them on the primary..<br><br>I upgraded the pci card to watch DVD's and other such things (DIVX) on my TV..<br><br>When I first started AVS, the small window on my secondary graphics card (which I use as my primary desktop) would be overlayed to both of the displays on the primary card, I could run it faster and better because I was really only running a small window that was being overlayed.<br><br>Since this problem, I can only get it to overlay on one of the PCI card's monitors at a time, and only on the tv if I boot the system with the monitor off so it picks up the TV as primary display.<br><br>It's a really wierd glitch, it's not so bad, I can still get it to work with only thew two displays, but when I'm VJ-ing at parties/events, I like to have the second monitor to watch what I';m doing. It isn't always possible to set myself up looking at the projections I am creating.<br><br>UNCONED - I have worshipped you since your first set of presets came out. I really think you should look into two graphics cards (or even just one with a tv-out).. You can get so much more out of the presets, and it's so much easier to work on them when you can see the results instantly both in a small window on your desktop and fullkscreen on the tv. Your visuals regularily get displayed in my living room when I'm showing off my setup, and yours and elvis's never cease to wow my friends.. I usually don't use other's visuals when I do parties, but I must admit I have slipped yours in a few time, always showing the unconed promo AVS at the beginning and end of any presets of yours I show.<br><br><br>Anyways.. If anyone knows anyone who could help me one on one, or who might be able to help me find other things to tweak, I pretty much know what I'm doing, this seems more like a glitch than a proiblem with settings. I also tried re-installing winamp, but to no avail..<br><br>I'm starting to think it could be some sort of display setting in windows causing my woes, but can't even imagine where to start looking for it other than all the settings I've already played with..<br><br>If it hadn't worked from the start, I wouldn't be so insistent about it, but since it did work, and now it doesn't, I'm hell-bent on getting it back..<br><br>I tell you, once you've used avs in a multi-display system, you'll never go back.<br><br>Thanks again for any help! Anyone who can help me gets to wear the title of "Transfrmr's Personal Diety" for a day.. And I will send you a million dollars in monopoly money..</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2002 00:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Cool... I don't have the cash or space to get a multiple monitor/tv setup though. Not to mention that AVS is just a small hobby, I don't VJ myself.<br><br>Btw please don't tell me you've been ruining a perfectly good show by displaying big, boring presets that just say "UnConeD"... giving credit is good, but not in big fat letters and not on parties :). Besides, I doubt anyone who goes to the party knows me. The intro's are just little warm-ups for my packs :) :).<br><br>Now, your problem sounds like one of those hit-yourself-on-the-head-multiple-times-once-you-find-the-solution kind of problems...
