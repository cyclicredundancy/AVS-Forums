      <p class="post-content">yeah, i was referring mostly to physics, although the life-algorithms are <b>very loosely</b> based on biology, and the atom preset I am working on is based slightly on chemistry, but some branches of physics incorporate them as well.<br>

      BTW, we can't really complain about this question. The kicker is "how do I turn them off?". Nobody that I know of has ever asked "how do I enlarge the time difference?" But maybe that's just my pedantic ass doing what it does best again. :D
