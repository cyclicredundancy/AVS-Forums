I'd post code but I cant be bothered.<br><br>People overuse trig functions in AVS, they seem like a universal solution to any problem when you start coding AVS but you get better control over your preset replicating the effect with your own code.

I thought thats how tugg came up with all his code. It's all in the PAK film "PAK-9 AVS 4 SE in outer space!"...<br><br>Tugg, or 'space monster #3' wants to code the most amazing presets so he can rule the solar system and enslave mankind; but space monsters can't code so he travels to Earth and steals all the monkeys and takes them back to his secret base on Europa. Synth-C (Ambassador Middleton) sends Nemo (Captain 'Orange' Johnson) to find and return the monkeys but he is killed when the evil Vanish (Galgamaar) lures him into a white hole by creating an irrisistable siren song of swirling colour and stellar music response by making a sun go supernova inside it. Mysterious_w (Ensign McSpacey) launches an escape pod before the ship explodes and heads for Euoropa to return the monkeys.<br><br>Meanwhile tugg is churning out great presets and slowly controlling mankind with his hypnotic colours and technical presets with bizzare I-can't-believe-this-works code (most of the stuff in Extra Dimension). Back on Earth Synth-C see's that nemo has failed and comissions montana (Dr. botchy adams) to create a computer virus to beam to tuggs evil headquarters and blow it up, so that at least mankind will not be controlled by the mad space monster. The virus is beamed out, and earth waits for the signal to arrive and destroy evil HQ.<br><br>Back in space, mysterious_w has kept ahead of vanish and arrives on Europa, racing to the HQ to grab the monkeys. He messages earth saying he has almost finished his mission, when he learns of the virus heading for the planet! So with vanish chasing behind him he throws open the doors of the HQ and races to the monkey room. Bursting in he finds a shocking sight, earths monkeys typing away on a million computers (and about a thousand monkeys flinging poo because AVS crashed on them again). He pushes the button to release them from their shackles and shouts 'follow me to the ship!' But as he runs for the door, vanish looms above him dribbling saliva and foaming with rage. mysterious_w thinks its all over, when all of a sudden vanish simply steps over him! mysterious_w turns to see tugg in all his monstrous glory thundering through the monkey room toward him.<br><br>"My Monkeys!" Tugg booms, "You will pay!"<br>"Not so fast" Vanish spits "With these monkeys gone, I, VANISH can control the earth, your days of weird experimenting code are OVER"<br>Tugg roars a deafening scream... "NEVVVEEEERRR!" And the two mighty AVS artists grab each other with the force of a thousand superscopes. mysterious_w sees his chance, running for his ship with all his might he hurries the monkeys into the tiny cargo hold of the escape pod, they barely fit, but it will have to do. From the evil HQ 200 ft away, murderous screams and thunderous blows echo, the ground shakes and ripples with shock. mysterious_w blasts into the sky and races from the planet as the virus ploughs into the HQ and triggers the explosion. For a moment all is white, then the raging heat of a thousand suns, concentrated to a single point expands to an explosive ball of nuclear energy. The escape pod blasts out of the smoke and flames, as the planet tears itself apart from the power of the nuclear inferno. The battered ship chuggs on, its weary warrior pilot picks up the transmitter and places it to his lips.<br><br>"This is Ensign McSpacey... I'm coming home"<br><br>The End<br><br>*cough* yea I really didnt have anything better to do than write that.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th October 2004 15:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by PAK-9</i><br><b>How many hours did you spend thinking that one up</b></blockquote>*cough* :)<br><br>It's funny though...
