      <p class="post-content">----------------------------<br />
      1) Bump - 1/5, not very good looking.<br />
      2) Complicated Scenery - 2/5, not at all responsive to music. The scenery may be complicated but it doesnt look good.<br />
      3) Discreet concept - 3/5 The border is a problem else its an ok preset. Could have added some more effects though. Collision among different particles would be cool :D<br />
      4) Hunt for Dino - 2/5 I dont what the preset is supposed to do.<br />
      5) Light Drawing - 2/5 Doesnt lok like a complete preset.It doesnt even seen to respond to music. It continues to draw shapes when i switch off the music :igor:<br />
      6) Light waves v4 - 3/5 Good colours, but again not responsive.<br />
      7) Living creature - 1/5.<br />
      8) Its6 - 2/5 the dot grid movement could have been more responsive.<br />
      9) Millions of stars - 2/5.<br />
      10) Oxygen 4r - 2/5 Not done properly, the text does not appear in all window sizes.<br />
      11) Projectors 8c - 2/5 Good idea but again not a preset.<br />
      12) Rio-de 3/5<br />
      13) shuffle -3/5<br />
      14) Spectrum voiceprint - 2/5 repetitive<br />
      15) cage - 2/5 good design but, again not responsive<br />
      16) the house - 2/5 dirty background.<br />
      17) the house summer - 2/5;<br />
      18) pyramid - 3.5/5 - I like the concept, could have been better. more camera movement, raytraced planes etc etc would have made it better.<br />
      19) torus lights 2/5;<br />
      20) winter sports - 2/5;<br />
      <br />
      Overall - 2/5;<br />
      <br />
      You seen to have good programming skills. Use it to make better presets. Lacks completeness, good colours, responsivity. Anyway, you can always improve!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Potnis is right man. your 3d and camera control scopes are amazing for a noob. but you see AVS was meant for music representation like a osc scope or spec scope. you know what i challenge you to create 3 3d osc and spec scopes the rotate on 3d and have the ability to change colors. good example would the the vortex preset. try it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I have to be honest your pack confuses me quite a bit... I think my experience can be summed up by the preset "oxygen 4k" ...<br />
      <br />
      I load it;<br />
      I see wobbling red texers;<br />
      text tells me to click the upper right hand corner for help;<br />
      I move mouse to upper right, yellow circle eminates from point;<br />
      I click, red blob appears under my cursor and starts wobbling;<br />
      I click again, the blob snaps to my cursor and continues to wobble;<br />
      Moving my cursor around i find a green circle eminating from a point in the top left;<br />
      I click it, nothing happens;<br />
      I notice the text "Show Hidden" in the bottom right, I move my cursor to it;<br />
      Help text pops up, I cant really understand what it is telling me;<br />
      I click "name" which has appeared in the top left, the preset title dissapears from the text;<br />
      I clutch my face in dispair, a small child weeps somewhere;<br />
      <br />
      Many of the presets have a similar "What the hell is going on" factor to them not least of all "Winter Sports" (version 9i3?! That isnt even a number!) which I found irritatingly confusing and unpolished. I have picked on two mouse control ones especially, because mouse control is something people generally do not like even if it is subtle and logically presented.. if you expect people to spend five minutes working out exactly what the preset does and why you really dont stand a chance, people just cannot be arsed.<br />
      <br />
      Some of the presets are interesting, but the sheer number of times I shouted "WHAT?!!1" at my monitor is really inexcusable. Here are some do's and don'ts for you, please take them to heart, for all our sakes:<br />
      <br />
      <b>DO...</b><br />
      - Make your user interaction clear and logical<br />
      - Make presets simple enough that they can be understood without explanation<br />
      - Comment your presets if they MUST require explanation<br />
      - Near plane clip your 3D ¬_¬<br />
      <br />
      <b>DO NOT...</b><br />
      - Put user interaction into presets for the sake of it<br />
      - Include multiple versions of the same preset (2 is ABSOLUTELY the maximum number of different versions for a single pack, you will NEVER see a good AVS'r put lots of different versions of a preset in one pack)<br />
      - Display the title of a preset in the preset itself (I can read the title in the filename and comment it really isnt necessary)<br />
      - Put experiments into a pack (living creature.. "WHAT??!")<br />
      <br />
      Okay I'm done preaching, my voice is hoarse from shouting at my monitor.</p>
