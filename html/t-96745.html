Take a look and see if you like them:<br></p><ul><li>Allow you to use and define the red, green and blue variables in movement, dynamic movement, and dynamic distance modifier. This will be able to replace the brightness, fast brightness, multiplier and unique tone (well, they'll still be there for compatibility, but not used much anymore). You could also shift the pixels depending on for example their green value: x=x+green; or d=d+green; The possibilities are great. What about this one (t is in frame with formula t=t+0.05): red=abs(sin(red*2+t));</li><li>Imaginairy numbers: not only support for a+bi, but also the polar variant re^(theta*i), which would be de^(ri) in avs.</li><li>New rnd function. Syntax rnd(input,amount) It would round the input value, with the amount you specify. I think the amount would be best specified like this: 0 = round on 1, 1 = round on 10, -1 round on 0.1, and so on. For example rnd(4.5653,-3) would make 4.565.</li><li>Now the most difficult one to program: lists. This would allow you to store and recall values in a list. You could make particle engines! The functions would be store(value,indexvalue) and recall(value,indexvalue). The indexvalue is a bit difficult to explain, so I'll give an example code (in pixel):<br>list=recall(x,i);<br>x=sin(x) or any other function;<br>list=store(x,i);<br>You can choose the name of the list yourself, ofcourse. The first line recalls the value x with indexnumber i. This gives x the value that's in the list and is stored under the indexnumber with the value of i. You then do whatever function you like. Then you store the new x with indexnummer i (which would, in this case be the same).</li><li>Different forms of mosiac. Now it's just rectangles, but circles or triangles would also be cool.</li></ul></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nic01</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th August 2002 20:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: My additions to UnConeD's wishlist</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by skupers</i><br><b>I think UnConeD's list is pretty complete, but I've some small additions.
