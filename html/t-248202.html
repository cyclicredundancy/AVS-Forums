Now that im a bit older n00b i realize that while it is a novel idea, in practice the Tricks &amp; Tips fails horribly. Most of this is because it has no control whatsoever and there is no way to remove obsolete, old or just way too simple stuff in today's standards.<br>Also what qualifies as a tip or a trick? How simple to go with the tip or how advanced? Is it a tip about coding? Is it a ready-to-use string of code that is useful in general? Who shot the monkey? And why the hell im still writing this?<br><br>In short: Novel idea, in practice fails horribly without any sort of control or organizing.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JFASI</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th June 2006 15:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Suggestion: Three Tips and tricks sections.
