      Yep, you read right. After 4 months since Explosion came out, the new pack has finally arrived. Get it from the links in my sig, and I hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I did creating it!</p>

      <p class="post-content">No time to go in depth righ now (school and all) :(<br />
      <br />
      Initial reactions:<br />
      - No Winamp2 install, but I can take it.<br />
      - is the fire supposed to be at the top of a mile from hell?<br />
      - nice pack overall. Your presets have evolved :up:<br />
      <br />
      Tune in later for more detail.</p>

      </blockquote>Oh hell (sorry :p). I put in a screen reverse because the DM put the thing up the top. Don't tell me I've got a compatibility problem. Did the screen reverse install, because it did on mine.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the feedback man.

      <p class="post-content">Figured out what happened. I had winamp and AVS running when I copied the pack into the right directory. AVS didn't think they were there.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">one funky discoball</font><br />
      Looks nice, but static. Maybe some colours and an onbeat gradual reversal of the swirl direction.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">nova rush</font><br />
      Requires a certain type of music that I don't feel like listeninng to right now. :) With some nice happy hardcore techno it would get you pumped.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">glow ball</font><br />
      With the right superscope, this could be awsome. Right now it's kinda cool. I like the "fingers" on the glowball.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">postmodern</font><br />
      I like this one. :)<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">the advantage pack</font><br />
      Nice and simple. I think it should be the first one in the pack though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">meant to be</font><br />
      would benefit from a more stuff going on in the background. I added a second effect list and used a buffer save, switched the movement to a DM and use the buffer as the source.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">can't tune in</font><br />
      Not bad for relaxing. With some variety in the movement (speed changes, distortions, etc) it could be pretty cool.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">motion picture journey</font><br />
      Pretty cool, but I wouldn't watch it for any extended period of time.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">dying star</font><br />
      Looks pretty nice. Again, a chilling preset. Some colour shifting would be good.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">hall of sound</font><br />
      You got rid of the distortion, nice. :) It'd be cooler if the spots brighness corresponded with an oscilliscope or spectrum value though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">lake of fire</font><br />
      Pretty good. I liked it better after I made the rotation do a gradual shift, and made it go in both directions.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">dreamers disease</font><br />
      Pretty nice, but I've seen that kind of thing before.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">inside a flower</font><br />
      Again, I think a gradual shift in speed would be better. I like things that flow.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">push away</font><br />
      Not bad. It looks a lot mopre interesting when visfrac is set to 50/50 blend though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">stained glass window</font><br />
      You're right. It does take a while to get started. Some color separation would be good, but I don't think you can do that, unfortunately.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">the edge</font><br />
      Nice. A little too bright though (oww my eyes). Sometimes you lose the colours.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">swirling dancefloor</font><br />
      That is a neat effect. I'd like it a little higher off the floor though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">a mile from hell</font><br />
      I think the glowing points would be better if the starfield didn't move and just scrolled up. BTW you could fix the upside down thing by making the whole statement negative in your DM instead of using screen reverse. It gave me 2 FPS.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">analyser cube</font><br />
      Good one. :up: I'd have made the cube rotate faster, but to each his own.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">nova rush 2</font><br />
      I had a whiteout problem with this one. Too often too much of the screen was entirely white. BTW. You did do some coding in the superscope :p.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">musical breakdown</font><br />
      Meh, this one didn't do much for me.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">undersea exploration</font><br />
      Nifty. This one was nice. It had a whiteout problem too, but not as bad as nova rush 2.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">stick diso</font><br />
      Watch out Mr. Happy. :) I foud the arm movments a litte repetative, and the didn't go with the beat :(. The floor looked pretty nice though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">halucination 4</font><br />
      Again, it's all about the smooth transitions. Looked pretty nice though.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">computerized nebula</font><br />
      Me like :up:. Too bad you can't go completely upside down.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Landscape</font><br />
      A little bland for me.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Wormhole</font><br />
      Looks pretty good, but I'm missing the smooth movement transitions.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Swirly Stuff</font><br />
      Kinda neat. Too bad it only swirls in.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">Tribute</font><br />
      Didn't do much for me, and here's not the place to go into why.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">psychadelic nebula</font><br />
      I liked this, but it could use something in the middle for when there is no beat detected.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">Overall</font><br />
      Big improvement of your last pack. Your later ones are looking really nice.</p>
