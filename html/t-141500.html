      <p class="post-content">That's nice atero, but maybe if you could add a pause if it is shifting between several different shapes immediately after eachother so it you can actually see the different shapes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well that would kind of defeat the purpose of the smooth shifting. The idea behind this was that it wouldn't be so boring and stiff like some of the other morphers I'd seen around.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It would still be smooth, it would just give more time to recognize the shapes. Right now I have to watch it morph about 30 times before I can see what all of the shapes are.</p>

      <br />
      also, i DID manage to update the thing so it changes 1/6 beats instead of 1/3, right? can't be arsed to download the preset now, in a hurry to leave :/</p>

      <p class="post-content">notice that i said "years" ago, i am not sure when, but i do know he is the first<br />
      <br />
      atero: and if you are soooo ignorant to say that paranoya sucks, look at the period of time that he worked in. He ended his avs career roughly around the time that dymanic movement was released. The technology for avs was really limited.<br />
      <br />
      please look at avs history or whatnot you smartass, you'll see that paranoya had a greater impact on the art than you'll ever have. how about you get some skill before you bad mouth legends.<br />
      <br />
      and please be original, i see el-vis in some of your presets, and i can't believe that i even inspired your ulgy "more xor".<br />
      <br />
      Atero, if you are going to make presets, make them original, and make sure that they look good, and make sure that they react to the music (it is the entire purpose of avs, if i am correct)<br />
      <br />
      to be honest, i had no idea of how you even were before you became this turdbot who just all of the sudden started to piss me off. i can say for sure that i could have used my bandwidth for so much better stuff than downloading your pack.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Paranoya did not suck. Paranoya was (and still is, IMO) one of the greatest ever AVSers. I still watch his presets - although they may not be quite as technically advanced as presets are today(partially due to his timeframe), they are amazing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Funny how someone who likes an avser who got big on making the same preset over and over again is telling me to be original :rolleyes: You can't be serious about El-Vis; most of his early work really DID suck (before he got into 3D/warp DM's), and most of my stuff is trans-oriented, and I hardly ever use 3D (in fact I've never made a true, full fledged 3D preset). Oh, and maybe YOU should take a look at AVS history, since you don't seem to have any idea of what's going on around you atm. If you did you'd know how stupid that statement about Paranoya was; I don't give a shit whether or not El-Vis was the first to do 3D, I figured it out on my own and I did my own thing with it. As for my presets being ugly and unreactive...take a look at that preset you made your avatar out of, and think about that statement again. And don't EVEN get me started on wasting bandwidth - you've been postpumping so much the last couple weeks it hurts. You're the one who started acting like a "turdbot", not me.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Atero, you get pissed at anyone who has an argument that doesn't support yours - you don't even care to bother listening to their statements and simply dismiss them as wrong. You are too quick to argue, but way too slow to listen.<br />
      <br />
      El-Vis didn't start out that well when he first began making presets, but very very few people did - you can't say someone is bad because their first pack wasn't good. If it weren't for El-Vis, then AVS wouldn't be what it is today. Your first packs weren't that terrific, but I would still consider you a good AVSer because your last couple of packs have been nice.<br />
      <br />
      Paranoya made some of the most artistic presets to date, with exceptions given for a few artists(i.e. Tuggummi).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The point I was trying to make is that none of my (recent) work compares to any of el's. In fact my first three packs (again, PLEASE don't go looking for them, I never deleted them for some reason) really sucked...but even those didn't really compare with el that closely. And since when was horsefly saying anything worthwhile to listen to?<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and I just remembered to slow the morpher down to 33 fps (I'm getting about 70 on it), and it does seem to act strangely at that framerate...it seems to want to stick to certain shapes for some reason. It didn't do that when I sped up the transition speed 4x, tho. Wierd :igor:</p>

Hmm...let's see...you called me an ignorant smartass, said I'd never have a great impact on AVS (funny, I already have), said I have no skill, called me unoriginal (and made a completely baseless insinuation to that effect), called one of my presets ugly, proceeded to call *all* of my work unoriginal, ugly, and unreactive, called me a "turdbot", and then made a completely inflammatory remark about my new pack.<br />
