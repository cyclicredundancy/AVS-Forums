      <p class="post-content"><strong>Looking for experienced programmer to consult on game project</strong><br />
      We are currently doing some research for a game we are developing and we would like a programmer with alot of experience with AVS to consult for this project. In the not to distant future a programming position may arise for this consultant.<br />
      <br />
      We are looking for people who have made some really creative things with AVS and have come up with there own real time detection for certain audio elements such as beat.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You're really in the wrong place. This forum is about AVS: a specific, programmable visualisation plug-in. Most people here make presets for AVS, and are not coders in the traditional sense. They can tell you exactly how to make presets visually interesting, based on sound data that is available. But how that sound data is calculated is different thing. You need both to make your visualiser succeed.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to know about how to implement things like beat detection, there are entire libraries worth of DSP literature on the web. A lot of academic research is being done in this area too. But it all comes down to frequency analysis and correlation. How you detect it is up to you (FIR filters, fft, autocorrelation, kalman filters, etc) and depends completely on the situation. In a game, I'd imagine you don't want to spend too much CPU time on this, so you'll want to look at simplistic operations that give you a good enough result rather than something with 99% accuracy which takes 10 years of cpu time per song.<br />

      BSc Software Engineering<br />
      Msc Digital Signal &amp; Image Processing (current course)<br />
      Lotsa experience with AVS and it workings, coded frequency domain transforms and beat detectors using AVS etc...<br />

      In other news, I can't really understand saintstudios request. I did check their website and they are indeed a game developing corporation or something, but why would they want to either: a) code a game in AVS or b) Use visualizations in games is beyond me. I just can't understand it. AVS is very limited for games and then again why would you ever want to add visualizations into games? :confused:<br />
      <br />
      It all sounds very very <b>very</b> bizarre to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tuggummi: I have already been contacted by a well-known game company about something similar. There is certainly interest in visualisations for games.<br />
      <br />
      Think arcade machines like Dance Dance Revolution or those other quirky Japanese music-based games. With a cheap graphics unit in consoles, the rendering capability for cool visualisers is certainly there. You just need to get useful sound data.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Aah, Well with games like DDR it does sound logical. I was thinking about other type of "normal" games (like doom3, heh).<br />
      <br />
      But i hate DDR anyway... never played it, but i just know id hate it :p (it's the physical strength/speed needed to play it)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I too can imagine the need for on the fly visualizations in games. Maybe not even attached to music per sa just a nice artform in animated textures, etc. Not exactly what we do but if someone is paying. :)<br />
      <br />
      I emailed the guy too but personaly I don't know what angle this is coming from as the games are not teh DDR type more RPG/adventure from there site. A little worried tbh about what 'deals' they expect<br />
      <br />
      A summation from there site an advertised job<br />
      <br />
      "2D/3D Texture Artists<br />
      .............<br />
      We are looking for people who can dedicate a minimum of 20-25 hours per week on tasks. The project duration is about 2 -3 months long.<br />
      <br />
      The texture artist would be responsible for about 10 different textures. This position is entirely virtual, the only form of payment is credit on title."<br />
      <br />
      Ummh maybe just for some free/cheap animation. *shrug*<br />
      <br />
      Steve let us know if you games vis comes of anything. Always interested to see where nice vis art is going and of course the commerical oppurtunities attached to it. :)</p>
