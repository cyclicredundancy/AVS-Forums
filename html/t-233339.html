      <p class="post-content">By the beat responsiveness he means adding some response, in the beat sections, to the Dynamic Movements.<br />
      <br />
      Something as simple as this (see attachment) makes it all the more interesting. What this does is it changes the rotation speed to a random value every time a beat is detected, added with the previous constants. To make it even more interesting, we subtract by half of the division so that we can get negative variables in the speed as well, making the movements go into the opposite directions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Firstly, remove the convolution filter or move it lower in the editor. As it is, it is convoluting nothing. AVS works from the top to the bottom, so with nothing before the filter, the filter is useless.<br />
      <br />
      As for other style fix-ups, that comes down to personal preference. If you like the way it is now, leave it alone.<br />
      <br />
      Now, the Dynamic Movement, on the other hand, could use a few fix ups. What I would do is to change the alpha blending a bit. If you divide z1 by t, this should create a nice change. Another thing to do would be to add some more movement, specifically to the x and y variables.<br />
      <br />
      In the frame section of the DM (Dynamic Movement), add this to the end:<br />
      mx=mxb*2+mx*.99;<br />
      my=myb*2+my*.99;<br />
      <br />
      In the beat section, add this:<br />
      mxb=rand(10)/100-.05;<br />
      myb=rand(10)/100-.05;<br />
      <br />
      In the pixel section, add this:<br />
      x=x+mx;<br />
      y=y+my;<br />
      <br />
      It's not much, just a few ideas to make it a bit more interesting. :)</p>

      i made up the definitions on the fly, but they are essentially accurate... as such, they are two unrelated words with distinct meanings<br />
      <br />
      i've seen this mistake before and it really annoys me, because no matter how foreign you are, you have to be blind to not notice how the word is spelled everywhere...

      <p class="post-content">Coders that think its incumbent upon them to somehow "reinvent" language bug the hell outta me too (l33t), but its often hard to tell them from peeps for whom English is a second language, so I usually keep my peace. Still no excuse for arrogance for those for whom it is the first one. Just goes to show there is no such thing as perfection, no matter how much belief is given to it. Genuine mastery is open-ended, makes lots of mistakes, has nothing to do with domination or control, and is always <i>earned</i>.</p>
