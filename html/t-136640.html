      <p class="post-content"><strong>Radeon and AVS Overlay</strong><br />
      I'm using S-video TV out and expect to get AVS to show up on my TV, but to no avail. Winamp video outputs fine; WMP video outputs fine; WinTV outputs fine; But, Winamp AVS does not.<br />
      <br />
      AVS overlays to the desktop fine. But when in windowed mode, the TV receives only one frame then freezes while the AVS continues in its window on my primary display.<br />
      <br />
      I have never had this problem with 3 different Matrox cards. This is my first AVS overlay attempt on this new ATI Radeon 9800 Pro card. I have tried various resolutions and color depths with same results.<br />
      <br />
      Here's my setup:<br />
      <br />
      ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB, Cat 3.4 (latest)<br />
      WinXP Pro 2600.xpsp2.021108-1929 (sp1+)<br />
      Abit IC7-G<br />
      P4 3.0 800FSB<br />

      <p class="post-content">As I have stated, I have the latest Catalyst drivers. I have also verified (many times) the overlay settings. As I have stated, I have no problem with overlay outputting any other source including Winamp video, WMP, Power DVD, WinTV, Quicktime, ect. The problem only exists with Winamp AVS. None of my other 3 Matrox cards have this problem.<br />
      <br />
      I was wondering if anyone else with a Radeon card has experienced this. It would appear that there is something within AVS that is not compatible with Catalyst drivers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well i was going to post it but it's too big...download an older version of winamp and reinstall it in a different directory. copy avs into your winamp 2.91 directory, then uninstall the old winamp and reinstall winamp 2.91 *without* avs support. that ought to do it, but don't quote me ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Err you guys are missing the point though. AFAIK the overlay code hasn't changed one bit since it was introduced.<br />
      <br />
      It's probably a driver issue. Mess around in your driver's control panel, I believe Radeons have a theatre-mode for overlays or similar.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK, thanks for that advice, but AVS 2.5 does not solve my problem. Trust me folks, I've done everything I can do from my Catalyst 3.4 setup. I may not know how to program these drivers, but I know how to set them up correctly.<br />
      <br />
      As I have said, every other program I have that uses overlay redirects to my TV without a problem, including Winamp video. There is nothing wrong with my setup. Also, I have said that this was never a problem with any of my Matrox cards. So, apparently there is either a snag between AVS and the Catalyst drivers or there is something else within my system causing a conflict.<br />
      <br />
      What would really help at this point would be some feedback from people who have Radeon cards and whether or not they have successfully redirected the overlay to their TV. I would find it hard to believe that no one else among the zillion Radeon card owners in the world have tried doing this.</p>

      Ok, I'm an 8 year IT vet, I call myself a vet because ID 10 Tee's and luzers sort of got me burnted out on it (that's what I say to myself to make my unemployment tolerable. Uggh!) I've been to the nullsoft offices bringing gifts of 1980's computers that I knew Justin and Christophe grew up on. Also got to go to some classic arcade cabinet game expo with them and watch them help a MAME author out by getting astroids to run on a overhead laser. Trust me fellas, I know WTF i'm talkin about and I *might* know what the problem is...<br />
      <br />
      The workaround for this (switching the TV output to primary display and monitor to secondary display) Sucks ass because you end up with dialog boxes popping up on the primary display, i.e. the TV. You don't want your users seeing no freeekin dialog boxes over their acid melt plugins, that just plain wrong. Not only that but your windows taskbar will be on the TV too! Totally useless workaround by my standards.<br />
      <br />
      I understand sort of how the video overlay works, it's not a real pixel by pixel display of the AVS, it's hardware stretched over a patch, or a color that you choose(grabbed from the video buffer on the card). The problem is, I think most video cards only do video overlay on one display at a time.<br />
      <br />
      It's going to take some poking, but probably somewhere around hkey&gt;local machine&gt;hardware&gt;ati is a key for which display overlay get's enabled on. I just installed this machine at the (plug coming) 7 Bamboo Karaoke bar, 4th and Jackson San Jose, CA. Anyone who wants to see exactly WTF i'm talking about can come down, have a beer, and sing a song because that's our new karaoke machine. (21+ only)<br />
      <br />
      So yeah, in short, the machine for me to check it on isn't here. I'm goin down there tomorrow and i'll look for it, poke it with a stick, and maybe put my slimy finger in the registry's dirty nono places until I can make it squeal overlay on the 2nd display.<br />
      <br />
      Hope that helps, good luck.<br />

      I had to find out something before i was at ease enough to sleep...<br />
      <br />
      I found a usefull page, Near the bottom it says something about ATI MMC (multimedia center?) and talks about a solution for the overlay problem. Can't wait for my 8 hours so I can go down and try it, or read that it worked for the parent :-D<br />

      <br />
      Here I am.. I'm the bald motherfucker beating that nullsoft employee at DDR. Christophe's kaillera forums have been a little dry lately and this troll needs a new place to play for a while :-D Hopefully I can help be a good winamp evangelist because here, that IS the ONLY thing that matters.<br />

      <p class="post-content">toqer: there were 14 helpful posts with short bursts of advice, until you showed up, and I quote:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Trust me fellas, I know WTF i'm talkin about and I *might* know what the problem is...
      </blockquote>No offense, but you're the one who started the bragging. You say "I know WTF I'm talking about" and then proceed to say you don't really know a solution. How's that for a good first impression?<br />
      Especially because you then proceed to talk about how you went to the arcades with some nullsoft crew and kicked their asses. Well boo-hoo.<br />
      The only useful thing you said was in the post AFTER that.<br />
      And now on top of being annoying, you've managed to stretch the topic by posting a rediculously long URL (you should use the &amp;#91;url&amp;#93; tag to give links a useful caption).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      You still haven't talked about the theatre mode I suggested btw (on the screenshots on that page you posted, it's the ***1056;***1077;***1078;***1080;***1084; ***1058;***1077;***1072;***1090;***1088; checkbox):<br />

        In this mode the overlay contents in the clone mode will be shown on the second display in the full-screen mode.

      <br />
      I did check out your page atero , you're an incredible mathmatician, i'll hand you that in a hat. No hard feelings ok? I'd actually like to use some of your AVS's at the karaoke bar if you dont mind.<br />
      <br />
      Man this post started out nice but then I had to add something. Atero I tried to post that damn image cause that looks so much nicer than a link... How many words is a pic worth? I guess the forum is just set up to not let me &lt;img src=anyting. Either that or phpgraphy is preventing. Or -C has his webserver to tell referrers to fsck off. Whatever happened, stupid pic just didn't blah blah vlah.. blagfgity bllwow wow.</p>

      Remove the stars and put your image url in. You can't do it in the AVS forums though because the "img" code is turned off. See "forum rules" at the bottom of the page.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Getting back on topic, I have gone through just about everything Rage3DTweak offers with no change in result. AVS still only spits out the first screen to the TV. Whenever I resize the AVS window on my primary display or whenever I change a setup parameter in the Catalyst driver the static image on the TV refreshes.<br />
      <br />
      This is really a bummer because I use this feature for entertaining. When I have a party, I play music and redirect the AVS onto the big screen. Actually, I have found that Winamp AVS is the only visualization that even uses overlay. WMP and Real does not.<br />
      <br />
      Oh well, I guess I'll have to either dedicate one of my other computers with a Matrox G400 - G550 to do that particular job or wait for an update from either Catalyst or AVS. It will probably be the latter because everything else I have in this current setup is fantastic, including overlay redirect of all video to the big screen.</p>

      you can suck my balls, toqer. don't fucking touch my presets. i don't my name getting associated with assholes such as yourself. in plain point of fact i don't give a fuck if you can poke the spot on an atari 800 to change the background in mode 1, you're still a fucking moron. that might change if you stopped pissing and moaning about how much better than us you are whilst acting like a flaming newbie at the same time.<br />

      <br />
      My advice, get a hooker, then maybe when someone irritates you you wont be a hypocritte, "pissing and moaning", you asked for that one, no one pisses and moans more than you. Normally i would just leave it but you don't _ever_ stop griping and whingeing. Shut up already, give us your great knowledge and whenever you're pissed off go play hitman or something, just stop involving yourself in these pointless flame wars.</p>

      toqer as a newbie to this forums (with less then 20 post you are) it show a lack of respect others by showing off initially. Cool you know your stuff guess what a lot of other ppl do to. Challenging ppl is not going to get your useful comment noticed and respected. Showing off a king of the castle only means you are likely for a fall.<br />
      <br />
      Pack it in.<br />
      <br />
      Atero,<br />
      <br />
      For gudz stake will you please chill it I am sick of your moaning you had a great chance to prove your maturity and not respond to they flame and you failed. Sure you where 'attacked' first but bit your tongue are you will be here no more. I will not tell you again you have been banned once do not make me make it a per,m. one.<br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
