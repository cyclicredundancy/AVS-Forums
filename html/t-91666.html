My first Visualization</strong><br>hey guys, i've been working on this visualization for awhile, and i guess the total time it took me to make it was 6 hours. 5 of those hours were me striving to get the basic concept i had even better! This proves you can have a great visualization without using SuperScope (it requires FyrewurX)<br><br>If you would like a non-FyrewurX copy, i'll attach it later if you ask, but it doesn't look as good :(<br><br>It looks best like a cinema display, longer than it is tall... and it can look weird too small or too large... just experiement on the size...<br><br>Tell me what you guys think!<br><br>Edit: changed to a version where i added a comment to it</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ZealousDemon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">19th June 2002 21:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Bah!

I personally voted it's okay. You may think it's cool since you made it. It just means you're still learning how AVS works. Try using a variety of Trans and renders. Just tinker with them; you'll get it. :)<br><br>Remember: Everybody starts somewhere; so we started out much the same you are right now. Keep at it! Don't give up just because of a few votes that say it's bad. Everybody starts somewhere, but where you finish is determined by when you give up. Don't give up.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nic01</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th June 2002 00:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I didn't vote because "Terrible" is simply an exaggerated form of what I'd say... I don't exaggerate often.<br><br>Well, that's my vote when I consider the preset is not made from a newbie...<br><br>I'd say you're still in the low middle in the learning scale... You're currently in "No coding, all put-things-together-nicely"... But notice the "nicely" part though.<br>I'd say that the preset is a start...

It looks like coordinate geometry, which i still don't have too much knowledge in. I found one of the flaws was that the oscilliscope star was not mirrored like the rest of the visualization. I fixed this prob a bit, and it looks a bit better, and i'd say it'd be the end of that visualization.<br><br>However, i'd still kinda like to learn how all the coding works, because i look like this :igor: when i see how it all works. If there are any kind of totorials for the coding, i'd kinda like to see it, so that i could help me out if i'm going to create future visualizations.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">cmountford</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th June 2002 04:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>coding</strong><br>check the faq (under the main AVS forum-not the preset sub-forum). Try searching the forum. Or just set it so it looks at messages from the last year, and then just look through the various posts in the AVS forum &amp; AVS Presets sub-forum.<br><br>I'm working on a guide. Kaboon is looking at what I have so far-but it's not anywhere near yet. There's several other people who have either completed or are working on tutorials (again: check the forums-*hint hint*) :)<br><br>Okay-hope that helps.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th June 2002 06:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hey, it's okay for a first time.
