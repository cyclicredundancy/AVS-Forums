What about Game of Life (Atero ;))?<br>I'm sure your plugin is very nice (haven't checked it yet), but coding something with some much possibilities as AVS is difficult. Most of those 3d plugins only have quite limited possibilities, usually they can only do 3d and some 2d Oscillators and Spectrum Analyzers. Do you the plugin called Eonic? Very nice 3d visuals, but it gets boring, because you can't edit it and it's only 3d.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th September 2003 15:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">look th3matr1x i dont say that other plugins are bad but its just that <b><u>i</u></b> think *know* AVS rulez and <b><u>nobody</u></b> can change my opinion.<br>That's it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">th3matr1x</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th September 2003 15:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">hey , I forgot to tell ya , that the liquidtrixx ver2.0 plugin is an older version , than the one i'm working on.<br><br>And to Nic01 , Ignorance is your world.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">th3matr1x</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th September 2003 15:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">hey , I forgot to tell ya , that the liquidtrixx ver2.0 plugin is an older version , than the one i'm working on.<br><br>And to Nic01 , <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/3074027/" target="_blank">you dig it?</a> Ignorance is your world.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th September 2003 15:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">how is ignorance his world - he says that we don't just stick with AVS.

But I don't want to see you over pimping your stuff or overly slagging off AVS.<br><br>Obviously a custom written 3d hardware driven OPenGL/Direct X plugin/program will run quicker, etc then the CPU based AVS but showing of this obvious fact is getting you nowhere.<br><br>But sadly for you one thing that AVS has got that you haven't is a sense of community. THe community is what makes AVS popular and grow all the time. To dis AVS is to also dis the community.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th September 2003 14:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">/me hears a big *clunk* coming on...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Rovastar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th September 2003 14:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">:)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
