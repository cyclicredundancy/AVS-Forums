      Hi folks<br />
      <br />
      We are on the lookout for a new reviewer for the AVS preset packs on winamp.com<br />
      <br />
      Does anyone here want to give up a little time to help review the packs? Someone experienced and can feel they can put a paragraph of text together.<br />
      <br />
      I must admit I only know the long term old school authors like Jhekio and killabyte that are still here ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">also jheriko and me would be the only ones of legal age to take a job ;)<br />
      <br />
      no seriously, i'm not up for that.. actually i think the review-system does more bad than good. checking the submissions for viruses is one thing, but rating those amounts.. too much work and always unfair towards somebody. i couldn't think of anyone qualified/mature that's not equally lazy/uninterested as me :D (this includes jheriko and pak-9 basically)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok that is far enough I seem to remember you declined before many years ago when I hassled winamp staff to setup reviewers for this.<br />
      <br />
      I do think it is helpful though and I would rather someone that knew something about AVS review them otherwise anyone does and then copies/rip offs get uploaded, etc.<br />
      <br />
      It is a shame you do not think anyone is worthy.....:(</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, maybe grandchild or hurricane.. they're both balanced (aesthetics/coding) avs-makers and make a mature impression on me (i couldn't say that for the last reviewer). grandchild just became gallery director on deviantart following my recommendation.. still it's a lot of work on winamp.com i guess.<br />
      <br />
      from what i remember, mr nudge was interested in managing deviantart's visualizations gallery, so maybe he's up for the job.<br />
      <br />
      the greatest benefit would be to have someone more reliable than the last time, someone who checks submissions at least 3-4 times a month. as i said before, i'd welcome if the reviewers just control if a submission fits the requirements and focus less on reviewing. many of the previous reviews on "noob" submissions seemed a bit polemic and as such counter-productive for the support of winamp.com - though i can understand the reviewer point of view, but communicating personal feelings just doesn't seem very professional.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I didn't realize that you had a problem with the reviewers. I thought DoggyDog was the only active AVS reviewer and what I have seen they seem fine. Other than that, I imagine when it is busy, a big backlog anyone â€˜reviewsâ€™ them and that is what I donâ€™t like to see.<br />
      <br />
      Are there any rogue reviews that you think are a problem?<br />
      <br />
      I think it is important to give the public an indication of how *good* a AVS pack is. Some are very, very good others well are not. :)<br />
      <br />
      If you know little about the authors, etc like most people downloading them will not. Then they will be benefit from a review system I think.<br />
      <br />
      I will take you reviewer suggestions on board and will contact them later.<br />
      <br />
      Cheers</p>

      <p class="post-content">I honestly believe that 95% of packs that get released should get 1 star... I can't imagine there is much fun deciding just <b>how</b> nooby a pack is</p>
