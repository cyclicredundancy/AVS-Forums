Why do you want us to make fun of you? Too bad for you, Atero isn't here.:p<br><br>I don't know what all those a[letter] and b[letter] and c[letter] things are, but it isn't too difficult for me to try and explain what you want to do.<br>You have to solve for x, y, and z(although you actually want these to be called something else - most likely x1, y1, and z1) - simple enough. Then you have to actually give all those variables values - you can just plug in the numbers you want to use, or you can write equations for them so that they aren't constant. These equations can use any variable that you want - you can pick from the predefined ones or make some more of your own. For example, a common variable is t - used for time - which is incremented each frame(t=t+.01 for example).<br>The hardest part is the 3D rotation and projection so that you can get the nice 2D coordinates. I'll leave this part up to you - just search the forums and you will find plenty of threads on how to convert 3D to 2D and do the rotations. If you find a post by Atero, check his signature for a link to his AVS Primer - this has some good things that could help you.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">hungryskull</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th April 2003 02:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">3d projection isn't that hard,Anubis.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th April 2003 03:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah, but figuring out how to do the rotation is harder than anything else in this problem.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">SkoPii411</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th April 2003 03:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">but I cant even get this to display in superscope. why not?

You're familiar with transposing equations and stuff, yes? It should probably read like this:<br><br>x=sqrt((1/bc)(bi+(ay-aj))(ci+(az-ak)));<br>y=sqrt((1/ac)(aj+(bx-bi))(cj+(bz-bk)));<br>z=sqrt((1/ab)(ak+(cx-ci))(bk+(cy-cj)));<br><br>I'm not sure if that's right though. Can anyone who's good with numbers check it? (I promise, I'll get into researching this stuff once I finish my break after the MiniPaks are done! :p)<br><br>BTW, z is a user variable, not an AVS variable, so you would want to translate it into a 2D space like this example (BTW, this won't account for rotation):<br><br>init:<br>n=200; pi=acos(-1);<br><br>point:<br>x1=sin(pi*i*2);<br>y1=v/2; z1=cos(pi*i*2);<br>x=x1/(1+z1); y=y1/(1+z1);<br><br>Apparently though, this method isn't the best to use.

You just define a set of instructions to calculate something, like as you would type it on a (simple) calculator.<br><br>For example:<br>sqr(x) = 4<br><br>Is not good. You're saying: "The square of x equals 4". This is a statement, not a set of instructions. The part left of the '=' is the container/variable for the result and can only be a name. Instead, it has to be this:<br><br>x = sqrt(4)<br><br>Now you're saying: "take the square root of 4 and put it into x". This is something the computer can understand because it's a set of instructions.<br><br><br>In a superscope, you have to calculate a set of (x,y) coordinates for every point. The scope will then draw these points (or connect them with lines). So if you want 3D, you'll have to do the projection yourself. Want to do voxels?
