      Always nice to see a skinner turn AVSer. There aren't many of us around. Heck, I can think of only 5 other people who did/do both with some degree of success.<br />

      The preset is crap indeed. No preset ever should flash annoyingly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I can say this though...the little dots need to go..It looks like a good star and idea but maybe with a little more design and working on the actual responsiveness..<br />
      <br />
      I ran it through Drum and Bass, Techno, and Breakbeat..<br />
      <br />
      It seems to have a definite beat pattern though the pattern does not start until the frequency does.. but then it doesn't keep up...<br />
      <br />
      But i like the background for the fact that it could actually be used like the idea of a screen projection on several screen like at an event with the main stage in your face...<br />
      <br />
      Good idea but needs more work, many changing up the "stars of the show"<br />
      <br />
      and getting rid of the oscilliscope and the ring or coding it into the movement of "the stars" woudl be a good thing..there one similar to this one which is more reactive .. I have no idea which one but it uses circles i the background with dancing squares which enlarge and shrink with the music.. quite rapidly and they even change the method like a switchback...<br />
      <br />
      anyways. BLAH B:LAH BLAH</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well going on the idea that most users buy their pc in the package and A seven year old system that was top of the line at the time is what I was referring too..and I never had one actually crash a system .. but upon lock-up the minidump process was preparing..<br />
      <br />
      Nor was I referring to all presets that do not work .. are the sole responsibility of the artist themselves not the presets..<br />
      <br />
      there are settings that can be adjusted to make them able to be run correctly..<br />
      <br />
      I currently with my new and old systems have to turn all of the definition down and then use pixel doubling to keep the CPU down..<br />

      <br />
      <br />
      But truthfully this was starting out as a compliment that is that the first Visual he made wasn't a complete borderline viral pile of shit..and definitely not a waste of time and worth mine to give him honest feedback.. in hopes that it can still be worked on..its not a loss..<br />

      </blockquote>You have unnatural luck. Ask anyone and collect some data, then you will have evidence that contradicts your supposition.<br />
      <br />
      Never forget:<br />
      <br />
      One counterexample = disproof<br />
      N examples = nothing<br />
      <br />
      In most cases even an infinite number of examples means nothing (problems can be continuous).<br />
      <br />

      What is likely happening is that you are mostly restricting yourself to "no code" components, and since evallib is the source of a great many of the crashes (especially during code editing when it is continuously compiling) you have a reduced probablity of crash. Unfortunately evallib code is needed for non-trivial presets, so we have the choice of /increased/ stability, or simple and boring (for us to make at least...) presets.<br />
      <br />
      Presets are /not/ the cause. There are no facilities in AVS that /should/ let you make it crash, if that were the case then I would agree with you that it is the preset authors fault. Since you can use AVS well within the constraints of "what it is supposed to do", and have it still crash, it is AVS fault.<br />
      <br />
      Also you made the suggestion that few, if any, AVS artists consider what the target system is. This is a major consideration for everyone. If you had some rough conception of the sort of things that we manage in AVS presets you would probably amazed that they run at the framerates they do...<br />
      <br />
      I draw the line at 10fps on my system in a particular window size (~500x400). I do this because presets which I made before on a 400Mhz machine run at that framerate on my 3Ghz machine in that window size. This works out reasonably well. The only time I have broken this with recently was with Starfighter Redux, which struggles to get ~9.5fps in that window. Don't forget though that preset features the highest polygon model seen in AVS, with more processing per triangle then any model I have seen in AVS (PAK may have done something with more lights somewhere... I can't remember exactly).<br />
      <br />
      I will accept that this is probably unacceptable for the casual viewer... but for my target audience its fine.

      <p class="post-content">well its slow I almost embarassed to post it.<br />
      <br />
      and its an Athlon..1.6GHz 512 ram... ( I wish I had a settings file I could show you for mine ) But i run Full screen 400 x 300 80% pixel doubling highest Framerate..windowed i run pixel doubling..with almost the highest framerate..<br />
      <br />
      When I am not fullscreen i have to minimize the window because the larger i make it the worse the usage gets..<br />
      <br />
      So if I am browsing doing downloads with Firefox, and waiting for hours.. for it to finish.. and i use Winamp with Vis.. it really uses it.. but if I switch to fullscreen leaving the task manager open .. the usage drops to almost nothing..<br />
      <br />
      I run my servers too at the same time as I am doing all this..<br />
      but they take up like nothing..<br />
      <br />
      beat detection i used advanced with auto keep and restart from scratch<br />
      <br />
      transitions.. i turned completely off at one point..<br />
      <br />
      but I run random and with keep rendering old effect<br />
      <br />
      this is with MX70 15" CRT Windows XP SP2 ( HP Pavilion 360n )<br />
      <br />
      All drivers and stuff up to date.. I run out to two amps with variable settings with two 10" Subs a combination of six mid range and tweets with additional sony Six inch subs.<br />
      <br />
      it bumps and the avs's rock out.. I dont have any issue with it now.. especially after like the past two updates..BUT back in the day..Mannnnn..LOL<br />
      <br />
      I actually have a way to use the laptop with Traktor DJ Studio and Ableton for mixes.. into the amps.. out to the computer and in through winamp using the linein:// in the url thing.. works pretty good.. all I can with the 'limitations' I have LOL..<br />
      <br />
      Was that un-necessary posting.. omg my first really truly un-necessary post..lmao</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay I was threatened by a member on these forums via private message.. Stating that in fact if I continue to discuss this issue with anyone I will become an unwanted member of this forum..<br />
      <br />
      will any of you re-read and explain this for this individual who I am going to keep anonymous for his sake..<br />
      <br />
      I even went as far getting a lengthy long ass explanation after trying to give someone a compliment and I am attacked on here and threatened via PM.. what is this a fucking Mafia assembly..has someone been watching the Sapranos too much.. or is it that someone has a chip on their shoulder..<br />
      <br />
      Does this person speak for all of in that the idea here is not to have actual discussions at all..and discussion over the reactions and hardware software performance are not personal attacks on anyone which is made given you have 6th grade and above reading skills..???<br />
      <br />
      I think that mentality would hinder the program ../<br />
      <br />
      It amazes me how everything single thing in this universe that I enjoy my music .. the AVS.. programming and coding all seems to be defiled by this crap from one person or the next..<br />
      <br />
      I can and will pull the compilation pack and get rid of the GOD damn software.. Having things right and understood and within their bounds is a little more important too me than someone walking around like some want to be gangster just waiting and looking for something to take the wrong way.. I don't let people into my life who have that mentality and damn sure don't want this shit on the fucking Internet either..<br />
      <br />
      PERIOD.. no discussion..<br />
      <br />
      You can either take it the right way or if you had rather fight .. and be ignorant and turn shit into shit.. Then I will have the ADMIN delete my posts here Using the Privacy Acts outlines by the United States Government and I will delete and go on my happy fucking way...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Er... I think you need to relax a bit there buddy, if someone is pestering you via pm just ignore them. As for the rest of us we like to flame noobs a bit on the forums but if you ask intellegent questions you will get intellegent answers.<br />
      <br />
      The only thing I would say is that you should try to be as clear and succinct with your English as possible, since English is clearly not your first language and it is sometimes hard to understand and/or easy to misinterpret your posts.</p>
