      After much (and i mean <font color="red">much</font>) arsing about i managed to throw together this DM. It's a little weird but the jist of what it does is zoom down a tunnel and pass through intersections. Think of it as ZG maze 2 without the stopping and spinning inbetween tunnels. Just as an example of how much of a pain in the ass this code is i messed with it for an hour because the thing broke when i changed t=t-0.5 to t=t-0.3 and it wouldn't enter the tunnel. Anyways i'd like to thank UnConeD for originally making the effect and helping me understand it.<br />
      <br />
      Here: :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hehe neato :). I expect we'll see some more 3D DM presets from you... just don't make the same mistake I did in the beginning: creating a DM can make a very satisfying preset for you, but it might still look like crap to others. Don't forget the V in AVS....<br />
      <br />
      Btw, here's an idea for your shifty preset.. to morph from closed to open, it currently jumps. You can fake a reverse intersection by simply putting a tunnel over it and cutting it off at a certain Z coordinate. Because the camera never looks back, this will look okay.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      PS: Usually we use "nickname - preset" for the filename... makes it easier to locate presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok will do the small things like naming. Makes sense to do so. Thanks for the tip, i was messing trying to make it come out the other end of the tunnel it enters but it wouldn't have it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The first version just goes straight forward without turning in the intersection, which makes it rather dull.<br />
      <br />
      The second version is indeed nifty, but you need make it look like it enters a tunnel &amp; comes out of a tunnel to the wide open space and enters the tunnel again after that. (i bet UnConeD already ment that, but im not sure :))<br />
      <br />
      Neat-o coding, but i agree, don't forget the V in AVS ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just another question for UnConeD if he reads this but, in the first DM, the one where it just passes through the intersection. Is there a way to extend the intersection on the z axis to achieve the same effect as i wanted from shifty? I've tried all sorts of crap but i can't seem to get it to work. I did that other idea but it was made from two different DM's and that's highly innefficient. Anyway.. if can help or try to help i would be greatly appreciative :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">When i joined i had been avsing for about a month or two. My secret as i very often advertise ;) to muchas progression is boredom and learning from others DM's and scopes, figuring out what stuff does. Searching the forums for explanations, math sites. I post on forums, avs, sleep, eat and occasionally go to school.</p>
