idea</strong><br>i was just thinking after searching yahoo for the last 3 hours...<br><br>there should be a visualizer that will work on a browser, not just in winamp .. like say i go to a website and its playing music in the background, it would be cool to have a corner or something that the webmaster can dedicate to be a visualizer for the music. or perhaps there can be a way to implement it into flash ? that would rock. a flash file in a corner of a page that is a visualizer for live played music on a webpage.<br><br>forget about file size .. i just wanna know if it can be done =) and if so how or where can i find it.<br><br>:D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th

These have nothing to do with game demos or something but they are programs that attempt to show off near impossible things on your computer, usually as a visual show with music.<br><br>Back in the old 386, the limit on demos was mostly CPU speed, so doing stuff like 3D was totally awesome. Today there are contests like 64K (make the coolest demo in 64K).<br><br>What the more advanced AVS authors do (complicated 3D effects and such) can be considering similar to the old demo scene.<br><br>The demoscene today is still active, but there are a lot of crappy demos around.<br><br>The vector-field and translation table is basically what a movement in AVS does (and what the Geiss plug-in does): apply a distortion to a field of values. The movement of every pixel can be described as a vector (destination - source). Because every pixel has its own vector, you get a collection of vectors, i.e. a vectorfield.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kow6969</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st February 2003 19:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ok ... so uhh ... duh ?<br><br>ok your pointing me in the right direction obviosly .. but i dont see what your pointing at .. i guess ill need to move in closer ..<br><br>ok you said earlier that i would need a way to play audio and get info at the same time .. since i plan on doing that with flash, ill have to point out the fact flash cant to that.. however .. i can use a program to get the info at intervals of my choice and write it into a text file ... and have flash read that and play it while the music plays and it comes out nearly accurate. but thats just a simple spectrum...<br><br><br>hmm .. let me see ... instead of reading the music data and showing as bars .. i wonder if flash could read it as one line. and if that works then ill have to find out a way to distort it, and finnaly color it i guess... thats a simple start.. ill try the line first.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st February 2003 21:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I took a quick glance at that tutorial, and basically it reads in the spectrum info into an array.
