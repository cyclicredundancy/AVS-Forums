And that problem is you! What the fuck is happening with the enthusiasm and lots of talking on the forums? This place is getting duller and duller. Is it just me, or what? Damn! I used to be happy around here. Now it's just nice, but enthusiasm? no :(. Am I the only one who feels this way? Nobody seems to really like other peoples work anymore. Somebody posts a new preset, and generally gains 3 or 4 replies now, instead of the about 20 which it used to be. And that's just one thing...<br><br>Damn :cry:<br><br>me feels sad<br><br>&lt;edit&gt;<br>Yay! I just got Major Dude, I love it :).

These AVS fourms are pretty boring lately. I don't know whether it is the fact that a bunch of people just don't have the time for AVS because of school, like me, or maybe it's just that we don't have the same varied amount of people. Hopefully the future looks brighter though with Winamp5 and the new AVS version, if Nullsoft doesn't mess it it up, we should have a worldclass app and a whole new reappearnce of talent and interest.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th October 2003 19:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I agree with that :) Though the forums can't improve without improving yourselves first, so that's what I'm gonna do :). You know what truly sucked for me the last time? When I posted my new preset (planet X molecules), and only one person replied to it after a week.

I am still doing my duties as an AVS reviewer and such, but I haven't been posting nearly as much in these forums these last few days - I have people and things in my life far more important than posting 20ppd in these forums. I still go through and read a lot, but I don't post nearly as much.<br><br>A lot of posts isn't always a better thing - a lot of times people end up just repeating what others have said, which doesn't really do much(hence my recent overuse of "me agrees to..." followed by an extension on their thoughts to further specify my thoughts on the matter). If I don't have anything unique to add, then I don't make the post.<br><br>As far as interest in others presets go, I still love AVS just as much as always and still like giving others feedback when I have the time(and it takes a lot of time for me - I try to go in depth with my reviews).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2003 10:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">i think that avs is pretty much just wearing out. as sad as it may seem, i think that the interest is going down because nobody's doing anything anymore, since everything's gotten so boring. i'm also pretty sure that the updates won't fix much of that. but i might be wrong...what with the release of wa5 a lot of people might "discover" avs, and if it's majorly cool, and if it keeps getting updates, we might live again...but i find that rather unlikely. not that i don't want justin to keep updating...;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nic01</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2003 18:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">*ahem*<br><br>Wait for a month or two, there'll be something that might rejuvenate the community...<br><br>Juuuuust wait.<br><br>(Or 3 months... or 4 months...
