Place the video file you want to show and the attached (unzipped) file in your winamp\Plugins\avs\ folder (usually c:\program files\winamp\plugins\avs).<br>2. Click the AVS window and hit r to turn off random presets.<br>3. Create a new preset in the AVS editor.<br>4. Add the component called "virtual effect/avi player".<br>5. In the drop down menu of the component select your video file.<br>6. (optional) There are some setting for the component that could let you make the video responsive.<br><br>You should however notice that it probably only works with .avi files (and not .mpg)<br>I realise that this might seem quite difficult if you don't have any experience with AVS. If you can't make it work, I could make the preset for you, you would still have to place the preset and the video file in the AVS folder though, and I'll need to know the filename of the file as well.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">blaz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th December 2005 10:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">well I tried the vfxaviplayer, and my short movie was going very slowly,don't know why.
