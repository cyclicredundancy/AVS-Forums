As you said there are great presets that use a minimum amount of code. On the opposite you'll find presets that are full of tough and incomprehensible code but look not that good. In my opinion it's not coding-qualilites that makes a good avs-artist, but it's all about style. Just go on making more presets. While you're going to become noticeable better you will also get more and more coding skills.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">beeferoni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th March 2005 05:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah, I am learning more coding for sure.

Milkdrop for example hasn't got this "ape" principle. This developement idea provides avs a longer life-time than other visualisations i think. Many problems can be solved with a new ape. But we will surely come to a point when no new ape's can bring us any further. I hope this point comes in farther future but you cannot be sure. It surely is a pitty that avs wont be developed any further. But untill we reach that point, when no new developed ape can help at a specific problem i hope that avs becomes kind of "open source" so that the cracks can develop avs itself further. It might be only my wish, but i hope that this forum keeps alive not only to provide help to newbies like you. But also providing a community (causev that's one of the points why im posting here: there are other avs-interested people that also want to share their thoughts concerning avs)<br><br>(please forgive me my very bad english/grammar this time, cause im pretty drunk while im writing all this). :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">beeferoni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th March 2005 06:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hey, no problem. I've seen worse english from people who aren't drunk. It is really good to know that you and PAK and some of the other AVS masters will still be here for a while. And I forgot about APEs, it seems like there is still a pretty good well of creativity to be had there. Of course, I am no programmer, so I can't really say how much more there may be to go (There are probably still several APEs that I have never even heard of). Btw, does deviant art or someone have a comprehensive list of all the existing APEs?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th March 2005 12:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><font size="1">*blush* hope you didn't count me in when you said "avs masters"...</font> ;)<br>About the future of avs/what ape's can further provide, have a look <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=210240" target="_blank">at this thread.</a><br>Actually i don't know if there's a such a ape-list, but i'm wondering why you should need one.

I assume the number of apes is finite, lol.<br><br>Actually I have discovered a bunch of apes and presets in my windows system folder. How the hell they got there I'll never know, but now I have a bunch of stuff that isn't labled with the author's name. (Like I make sure to label them as soon as I get them). So soon I will either post them up here to see if you or anyone knows who made them, or I'll just put them in a folder labled 'unknown'.
