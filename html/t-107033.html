Yeah it is, i play 3d games in high resolution and framerate and the AVS's before i installed winamp 3 ran smooth and looked clean. Now after installing winamp 3 and getting some AVS's like EL-VIS and Desibel my framerate sucks and im only running at like 640x480. I have a 1.33Ghz T-bird GeForce 3 and 256 MB DDR RAM and im running Windows XP, I shouldnt have any problems. Any suggestions by anyone would be appreciated :D Thx</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th September 2002 22:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The problem is winamp 3, winamp 3 is slow, especially if you have desktop alpha enabled and some complex skin over it all. Your graphics card has zip to do with AVS, but nice to see you have a GF3... nice and ready for Doom 3. Your processor is roughly the same as mine and I get some quite crappy fps using winamp 3.<br><br>The other thing is are you running fullscreen 640x480 with or without pixel doubleing because no complex presets run very well in that sort of resolution without pixel doubleing turned on, regardless as to which version of winamp you are running.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">skupers</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th September 2002 20:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I actually think there isn't much difference between Winamp2 and Winamp3. Well, at least at my computer they run both at around 35 fps with the same settings (320*200, no pixel doubling, no wait for retrace, the slider at the most left, no overlay mode, and same Render thread priority as winamp). I do have two tips:<br><br>Did you uncheck "Wait for retrace" in the settings/display options of AVS? This usually saves me around 8 fps.<br><br>And if nothing helps you can setting the Render thread priority higher, but I don't recommend that. It makes any other programs really slow.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th September 2002 21:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Read the FAQ, AVS is slow and doesn't benefit from a lightning fast video card.

I find the AVS situation disheartening because it is allowing great work to go to waste.

Stuff like Milkdrop really does the trick but gets old fast. I would just love to access the thousands of incredible AVS presets in something larger than a window the size of my tongue.

You deserve your computer to be spanked.<br><br>I'm not here to get into a pissing contest with anyone over their machine specs, but I run a Dual Athlon MP1800+ rig for L2 cache coherency -- only thing dualproc does to AVS is make it look like I'm using an MP1800+ with 512k L2 cache. Brennan might have a faster AVS rig than me with his Xeons. Maybe. RDR isn't as good as DDR for AVS, but he's doublewide.<br><br>Anyhow, on close to the fastest AVS rig you'll goggle my stuff plays at 32fps at 320x240. That's it. And I'm actually absurdly pleased with how well it plays on this hardware.<br><br>AVS is a RAM BOTTLENECKED APPLICATION. Ie: rule 1) when you say what speed video card you have and you complain about AVS, everyone instantly realizes you're full of shit and you probably will have no leg to stand on in this argument to begin with.<br><br>Once you get to about 1GHz, your processor is nowhere near the bottleneck anymore, except for how it actually talks to main RAM and how much cache it has inside of it. Personally, I run my stuff even "deeper" than everyone else, because I think the algos and the beats are more important than the raw framerates, but I'm not so stupid as to try to go above 320x240.<br><br>SAWG, I'm sure, told you no such thing. Or sawg deserves to have himself spanked for it. AVS is, as far as "raw performance" goes, probably some of the most original and well tuned code on the _planet_. While the interface could use an overhaul, AVS is at fairly peak performance.<br><br>AVS isn't going to magically go any faster until the bozos who build computers make QDR-RAM. Or start shipping 8M L3 cache systems like on the apple G4's now (Opterons should kick ASS for AVS in about 6mos with the 2nd gen motherboards -- celerons will not).<br><br>Once you see memory bandwidth (or L2 cache sizes) quadruple, you'll be able to play your AVS at 640x480. And then you'll find that they look ugly as sin at 640x480 because the human being who wrote them probably wrote them for 320x240 and AVS played back at a different native res than they were programmed for are highly suboptimal, too.<br><br>If you have no idea what I'm talking about, please spare me the "but it has to go faster" routines. I get enough grey hairs listening to people talk about how wonderful it'll be when they make it go slower than it does now.<br><br>Wheee.<br><br>Oh, by the way, just to brag at you and make you feel small and useless, I also have a nice big video projector to play with my AVS and put it full screen up on the wall when I throw parties. I'm still only rendering at 320x240 native resolution, but I'll BET some of you other kids besides me are smart enough to realize how to show full screen on your computer and still only render at tolerable res. There's actually 2 or 3 different ways to do it, you can even make it be your desktop underneath your icons if you wanna get extra scary uber tricky with it.<br><br>So, maybe, if you'd have said "hey, AVS looks cool, but I'm having problems getting it fullscreen without losing performance" then people could have helped you.<br><br>Maybe people might, still.<br><br>Maybe if you wanna believe that we're crappy programmers who just foisted this terrible hack onto society, well, you're welcome to do that, too. We're certainly not going to be able to stop you.<br><br>But if you're correct, then we can't do much to help you, there, either, now, can we?<br><br>Sorry. Oh well. Guess we can't help you after all. Thank you. Drive through.<br><br>But thanks for wasting my time this morning, I don't get to write enough vitriolic forum posts these days.<br><br>mig<br>"llama sucking bonehead 3rd class."</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
