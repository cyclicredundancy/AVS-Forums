      Well, i'm releasing my first Preset Pack here. I dont know what sites i can send such "n00bish" presets to, so i'll just stick with these forums :)<br />
      <br />
      I know some of you have made comments about these presets before, but i'd just like some comments from those of you that havent yet :) As i have said numerous times before, your comments will only help me to become even better! :D<br />
      <br />
      P.S. - If you know of a site that'll allow me to post these n00bish presets up, please tell me :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">firstly the site i used to release my first ever pack was this one.. but recently it seems to take ages for things to get published :( my favorite site at the moment for publishing my stuff is <a href="http://www.deskmod.com" target="_blank">www.deskmod.com</a> you can submit your own presets and they become available to download straightaway, and there are tons of crappy presets there too. Another great site is <a href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">www.deviantart.com</a> the only reason my packs aren't up there is cos my computer is currently screwed, all my nsis based installers are suddenly corrupted, so i wont be uploading things for the moment untill i'm sure i have no viruses left (i've reformatted my minor partition 7 times today :( just waiting for a backup source to be available to do a big cleanup :) ) anyway onto your pack...<br />
      <br />
      pretty good for a first pack, all of the presets seem to be really similar and of the wallpapery/tableclothy type that everyone seems to make. my advice is to experiment with the superscope and dynamic movement and anything else that you can plug custom code into, it may take sometime to figure out but at least every single preset you make will have a unique look and you will begin to develop a more unique style. nice to see that you custom coded some movements, at least you haven't just whacked together a load of default objects... thats redeeming in my eyes.<br />
      <br />
      keep making 'em :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">if you review other peoples packs and make more posts then people will take more of an interest in your work then more people will review your pack. &lt;/blatant hint&gt; If you were to maybe review mine for instance I would certainly be happy &lt;blatant hint&gt;<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hmm... I have seen these before. Not bad, and they aren't too noobish. I think it's a little small to qualify as a full pack though. I like to shoot for at least twelve presets in mine. I think I have about 8 that I'm liking for my next pack. (Whenever that will be)</p>

      </blockquote>Yea, i know you've seen em, it was really just the presets i sent out before with bug fixes and the like. I wont do that again, now that i think i can continue on my own without too much of the constructive criticism.<br />
      <br />
      And for the size.. I havent been making these deals that quickly, as i'm learning and experimenting as i go, so it's full pack for me :P

      <p class="post-content">don't worry about size, its all about quality not quantity. i've d/loaded packs, with 60 or 70 presets in, which have all been crappy tablecloths or render/ring + trans/fadeouts and junk like that, then there are packs like Whacko AVS II, which are pretty small, where every preset is excellent.</p>

      <p class="post-content">True, true. Quality over quantity. My first (and so far only) pack had 10 originals and 11 mixes. I'm trying to up the number of originals. The problem is that now my standards are higher. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tell me about it, after making my pack 4 i felt i couldn't better it and i released pack 5 which is a pile of cack in comparison :( Which means that pack 6 will have to be so enormously phat and overwhelmingly skillful that it will take the next 12 years to complete. :D<br />
      <br />
      (NOTE: That is not a lame excuse for the lack of pack 6... honest)</p>
