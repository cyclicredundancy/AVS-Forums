      <p class="post-content">:sigh: y'know, it's REALLY too bad I've been saying I've been good to n00bs lately.<br />
      <br />
      Cos I'm going to have to burn this one to a crisp :mad:<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      First point of business: Major dude has to do with how many posts you have. Anubis2003 has been here 3 months and has 3000-some posts, making him a Forum King. Tuggummi here has been here two years and has less than 500 posts, making him a Senior Member. I've been here a year and 8 months and have 1700-some posts, making me a Major Dude. Everyone here will agree that Tuggummi is a much more experienced AVS artist than either me or Anubis. The point being that post count and time registered does not make the AVSer.<br />
      Second order of business: Remember when it said, in giant fucking flaming red letters to <b><font color="red">SEARCH THE FORUM BEFORE YOU POST</font></b>? Remember that link to the AVS Frequently Asked Questions thread at the top of the forum? If you can't, go back and take a look at them. See how fucking impossible to miss they are? Well you did. You, my friend, are what we in the biz call a "fucking moron". THIS IS THE GODDAMNED AVS FORUM. Don't you think SOMEBODY would've asked "how I can AVS" by now? <b>USE YOUR HEAD</b>.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I basically agree with Atero. I'm a decent avser and have been doing it for about a year and a half, but I am not as devoted to avs as many of the people here are. In fact, some of the major avs people have very few posts here(duo,fsk,etc.). Search the forums and you will find a lot of threads that can help you. Even recently there have been a couple threads about making a tunnel.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Rocky, I know you are the author of the Rocky series because you said so in your first post. Personally I did not like any of your packs that I have downloaded and Atero is a much better AVSer than you, IMO. And why didn't you thank me? You thanked atero who made some pretty bad remarks towards you, but you didn't thank me when I even talked some about the tunnel presets? That makes me mad.</p>

      Rocky, it's just that these kind of questions happen so much, that eventually our man Atero (and probably some other people in the forums) are gonna snap. :eek:<br />

      I can't say I didn't see this coming, but just search the FAQ and forums and stuff, and keep up the :up: work on your presets.</p>

If you can code well does it prove that you're a good AVSser and if you can't code does it mean that you can never be good AVSser, <b>HELL NO</b>!

      <p class="post-content">OK.. I've been reading through these posts recently (haven't been to the AVS forums for a couple of months) - what is the big deal here, guys? I think you're taking all this stuff a bit too far.<br />

      Just take it easy, stop flaming each other, and actually try and help people that come here. It might encourage people to ask for help, whereas at the moment the entire forum is all about flaming and hassling new people.<br />

      <p class="post-content">We will help them if they first try and help themselves. Sure, some of the people in these forums do go a bit too far, but they have for as long as I've been here. The flaming has gotten out of control. I'll agree with you there. It's partially because of the moderator of these forums currently having a lot going on in his life and not being able to moderate these forums adaquately.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Granted, he may have asked a basic question, but you did (well, mainly Atero) kinda jumped all over him, without giving him a chance. There was nothing wrong with just posting "Please read the FAQ first, then ask questions later" - short, sharp and to the point.<br />
      <br />
      Rova is trying his best to moderate these forums, but you guys should be able to sort things out by yourselves! We don't have these kind of arguments over at the MD forums - we don't try and hassle people or get on each others' nerves. I'm not blaming anyone individually here, but I think a lot of you should jsut ignore a post if you don't like it. This will help stop the unnecessary flaming.<br />
      <br />
      Remember, you're supposed to be here to discuss cool ideas for a great visualisation program, not to have constant power struggles and flaming...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I normally do not jump all over them. Normally I will just post "Please search the forums/read the FAQ/google", but Atero beat me to it. Atero is known for his harshness to these kinds of questions, and normally the rest of us try to soften his blow some. He is a valuable asset to these forums, and does help keep the n00bs from constantly asking these questions. After one meeting with Atero, most of them never post a simple question again. Ignoring their posts won't help much either, because then they would get mad that nobody responds, and they still wouldn't come up with an answer.<br />
      <br />
      Also, not trying to say anything bad about Rovastar, but he does spend a lot more time in the MD forums, and that <b>may</b> be part of the reason why they are under better control. Plus, they don't have Atero.:p</p>

      Yeah, that's true, Rova does spend more time at the MD forums, but hey, we all know which program is better, right? ;)<br />
      <br />
      Seriously though, I know Atero knows his stuff, but you can be blunt without being rude to people. I can understand that it may get annoying when people ask you the same stuff over and over. That's why I said just post a three-word reply saying "Read the FAQ". Easy, solves the problem, and no-one gets annoyed.... sounds fine to me.

      <br />
      I understand your view of Atero, but we can't change how he acts. He does a good job keeping the n00bs at bay, and it is pretty rare that a flame war starts(the last one was legohead, I think, but that one is still going on).<br />
      <br />
      Just curious, do you think the AVS forums should have another mod?</p>

      Okay, maybe we should finally answer his question which was:<br />
      <br />
      How can I make a good tunnel in AVS?<br />

      <br />
      I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to have another mod, but you seriously have no idea how much hassle Rova went to, just to become a mod for anything at all. People had all sorts of issues with him - other moderators mainly. Don't know why though. However, as long as you can try and self-moderate yourselves, you should be OK. I'll have to remind Rovastar to pop in here a little more often to keep you all in order... :D

      <p class="post-content">Three pages long? One to me... Ah, the wonders of 40-posts-a-page. Second page and it's a huge thread.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways :<br />
      <br />
      There are many ways to make a tunnel... too many perhaps...<br />
      <br />
      First you can do the usual d=atan(d) movement for a (mostly static view) illusion.<br />
      <br />
      Or you can try the trick in Degnic's "Pipeline" (Right preset/author?) and do some stretchings to simulate a less static view.<br />
      <br />
      Or you can use an rx-dy (Not rd-xy!) movement and make it into a texture and add some transes. (Tuggummi - Putki)<br />
      <br />
      There's also a more complex solution involving raytracing (Read : Raytracing a tunnel). This is by far one of the best solutions (Yes, a bit slow and one bad edge...), but gives you the most freedom in camera movements/rotations. The only problems are figuring out the DM (Just do a little study) and figuring out the right texture.<br />
      <br />
      The last (But certainly not least) is using an SSC, with either the 2D or 3D approach - Both works nicely, but the 3d one is much better.<br />
      For a 2d approach, I recommend objects moving in and out (sync+wrapped movement) to give that 3d illusion.<br />
      <br />
      For 3d, you're home free... Until you run into the lots of problems...<br />
      You can use a dot-only SSC and texer it so that you can clip the points behind the cam easily and without stray lines (Nic01 - Dot Warpin').<br />
      <br />
      If you want to use lines, you'll either need to use a lot of points for up-to-date clips (Otherwise, ugly lines and ugly edges)... You *can* just clip it, but it takes some work to get the clipping right.<br />
      You can also cheat and confine the cam into one view (Nic01 - Just a Tunnel), and with the right tricks, it can make up for the lack of cam movement.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps.</p>

      The guy who's asked an innocent enough question? (I don't care whether it upsets you or not??)<br />
      <br />
      Or the "tools" who spend fk knows how long crapping on, typing pages and pages of useless dribble about how to use a forum properly, we're sick of hearing your shit etc... trying to defend it by saying it will SAVE THEM THE TIME AND HASSLE OF DEALING WITH noobS and Noobish questions???<br />
      <br />
      Some of you spend more time correcting useless questions than you do talking about avs. Report your goddam whining to the mod and leave the forums clear of uneccessary shyte!<br />
      <br />
      Heres an even easier method. Just type in:<br />
      Please search the forums before posting unneccessary questions.<br />
      And then leave the thread. derrrrrrr.... that took me about 10 seconds to do.</p>

      <p class="post-content">for your information, i happened to be browsing the "funny-assed pictures thread" in gd at the same time. &lt;edit&gt; saw the dumbass picture and thought it was appropriate. dammit i hate trying to make posts on 4 hrs of sleep and 12 hrs of wake... &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
      <br />
      and it takes a lot longer to type than it does to read. the fastest typists i know read twice to three times as fast as they type. i type relatively slowly, but then again i'm usually on a really loud keyboard so i kinda have too...it'd take me about a minute and a half to type that all up, but when you're thinking about what you're typing at the same time it takes about twice that long. hence three minutes.<br />

      I agree that it's anoying to read the same questions every week again, especially if it already has been discussed many times before. On the other Hand, what if we'll once have discussed everything in here? Discussing something twice can be fun too.<br />

      Sometimes I feel that the plan is to cause flame wars on purpose so you get another mod. This is not the right way at all. The way I look at things is I do not know who will be worthy of being a mod and have teh power going to the head.<br />
      <br />
      I only became a mod to move posts and stuff around NOT to be the policeman of the forums. I am sick of all your argueing.<br />
      <br />
      Please chill on the flames people. I normally turn a blind eye to mild newbie bashing but this is going too far.<br />
      <br />
      Atero (sorry to pick you out) if you are to talk to a newbie then please do so politely otherwise say nothing at all. This isn't complaticated it is simple.<br />
      <br />
      You do not have to attack all the newbies here. MAybe take a leaf out of UnConeD's book and just cut and paste the standard read the FAQ.<br />
      <br />
      WHat do I have to start threating you people with warning and bans and stuff so you play nice. WHat are you people 12 years old or something!!<br />
      <br />
      Feel free to PM me if you have any issues with post and stuff. And I thank all those taht have done so so far.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for teh sensible words Illusion. BTW I spend more time here then teh MD forums due to all the hassle here. :);)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Would all you post pumping people please take you business elsewhere. Have a 3 way conversation over msn, a chatroom, #*******, anywhere. This is a Forum, not a messenger service.<br />
      <br />
      That flame war didn't exactly cause me or anyone else any inconvenience but it does leave the forum a more hostile place to spend time and therfore, less fun. Atero's original post was funny i admit but both atero and legohead took it too far.<br />
      <br />
      Legohead: atero has quite a bit of respect around here as a knowledgable avs artist but i have seen very little contribution from you. If all you're here for is to occasionally cause flame wars over a flame war then take your hypocritical business elsewhere.<br />
      <br />
      Atero: please cool it. The first post was funny but it was directed towards a possible valued member. If you destroy every noobh who comes in here then no-one will be left eventually. Calm down. Give them a piece of your mind occasionally sure but keep it to a very minimum. The flame towards this thread is because you say the words "how do i make avs" and didn't read the post properly. The actual question was "how do i make a tunnel in avs?".<br />
      <br />
      Ishran: your original post was a legitimate question but it has been answered before, do a quick search in future. Don't make a habit of posting like in the second page, maybe in GD go nuts, thats awash with that kind of thing but lets try and keep this forum directed on AVS.<br />
      <br />
      Rova we realise you do a lot for these forums but we wanted a little more control in here which is why we asked. It has been resolved now, we have Gonzo and Rocker so it dosent matter any more. This entire thread is of no use to anyone except nic01's post on how to make a tunnel and would be much better off locked in my opinion.</p>

      Unfortunately I can't help out as much as I'd like on this forum - Im on a work dsl line so its kinda hard to test peoples presets/code with no sound card (hence no winamp)! :) And by the time I get home and manage to grab 5 to look at it - its already answered by the next day or two.<br />
      <br />
      Im sure you'll find I've helped quite a few people out where possible. I have tried PMing rather than bringing trash into the threads but it hasn't worked (someone likes taking pms and publishing them in the forum) Someones had to stick up to the roughneck attitude this forums holding towards new users - asking a seemingly lame question is all part of the learning process and its not a crime - its not like they've pissed in your mouth.<br />
      I come here for knowledge as do other "noobs" (I hate that word - I could probably code most of you under the table anyday - I wrote my first program at 7 years of age on a mac IIe) I didn't expect childish insults - and I've only thrown it back at him after alot of initial provocation.<br />
      <br />
      Im hoping at least some of you will take my advice and put one simple, non threatening comment on unwanted threads.<br />
      'please search the forums' etc...then everyones happy.</p>

      No-one is blaming you rocky although maybe you could have been more descriptive in your request. Rather than the making a general 'tellme how to make cool AVS' type posts.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway this thread has come to the end of it's natural life and teh padlock is out.</p>
