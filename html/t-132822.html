      <p class="post-content">Well the preset <i>Alien Skin</i> is psycho (flashy,ugly,trippy,weird all at the sametime)<br />
      <br />
      But the other two ain't that bad. Tho <i>Plastic Fabric</i> is a bit monotenous (read: boring) since the dynamove doesn't have enough variety.<br />
      <br />
      <i>Tides on saturn</i> seems to be the best of these, it is pretty simple and needs more variety in the dynamoves, but it runs great with techno music and is very suitable for party purposes i think.<br />
      <br />
      Decent presets UnripeLemon :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah those are pretty good. Alien skin was a bit grainy, it would look a little better if you made interleave a tad wider.<br />
      <br />
      (a <font color="orangered">bit</font> grainy, a <font color="orangered">little</font> better, a <font color="orangered">tad</font> wider, what a bunch of small words:p)</p>

      <p class="post-content">umm....whereas I'm opposed to anyone saying "hey look, i used invert/colorfade/fadeout/etc. to make a preset without renders!" because it's just fucking stupid (of course you could make something appear - you faded it in from nothing, fool), interleave does NOT count as a trans effect and just makes this pack that much stupider...when you can make a "trans only" preset that does not use xor/invert/fadeout/colorfade/interleave/bump/texer, i'll stop bitching....</p>

      <p class="post-content">I really don't think that counts... Atero once bitched (Ok, only complained, but there really isn't a line anymore) about me using Colormap for a renderless preset (By using the same thing that your colorclip do).<br />
      <br />
      I really don't think there's any other way then...<br />
      <br />
      I'd like to see Atero create a "pure trans preset" that we can actually see :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fuck it, an invert is not a render object, it is an invert of the colours, that isn't a render. If you don't like it atero, tough shit, deal with it. Don't ruin everyone elses day by bitching. Go bitch in the bitchlist about people using false trans effects in their renderless presets and see what response you get. Don't drag your cynical opinion on everything in here.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the point i'm trying to make is you can make anything appear on the screen using fadeout, invert, etc. now a normal "only trans" pack i would've been annoyed at as well, because those "no render" presets are bullshit - anyone can do them. but my biggest point was this isn't even a trans only preset because interleave <b>isn't a trans effect</b>. as if trying to make yourself look cool by not using any render effects was lame enough, you had to cheat on it as well :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ahh go out and get laid, then maybe you'll stop bitching if someone wants to do something. I don't see the point either i just don't care what they do, i rated the preset but i didn't rate it any higher because it didn't have anything specified as render. If anything it's a dumb idea, it restricts your possibilities for better presets but really, who cares. If the guy wants to let him. I posted my preset because i thought it would be funny and it took me all of a minute to knock it together.</p>
