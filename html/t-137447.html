It could just be the round shapes though... an ellipse in projected 3D looks wrong until you draw the stuff around it and it turns out it was okay all along ;).<br><br>By the way, whoever said anti-aliasing couldn't be done in AVS? It's just not very fast or practical... this is an antialiased cubic bézier scope. Of course it still suffers from the 45° linedrawing problem, but that's AVS' fault, not mine ;).<br><br>And blur is not the same as AA, but usually you can fake simple AA by blurring and turning up the contrast. Especially great when combined with the previous technique, as I did in the attachment (delete conv+colormap to get 'pure' superscope only antialiasing).<br>The reason blur is not real AA is because anti-aliasing requires sub-pixel information, whereas all you can do with blur is attempt to guess it. This causes sharp spikes to get rounded off and can cause meta-blob-ish behaviour.<br><br>If you want this to work with solid scopes, you'll have to maxblend each layer separately and then add them together. Or you could fake it and use additive with lower opacity, but this will result in a pattern on the scope (but this might look cool).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd June 2003 19:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Siddhartha: That's like saying really ugly is better than only slightly ugly.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2003 00:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Atero: depends on the individual yes yes.
