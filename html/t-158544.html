I think eventually it would be best to wait until it is a bit easier to do the full version and when there is a bit more time to do it. I don't ever really like languages that take the function approach to arrays and such. It is much more of a hassle to first have to use the functions, and then when you find time and switch it over - the old functions will still have to be included in new versions.<br><br>Just my opinion.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th December 2003 17:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">no, arrays are a very good idea, and would be extremely usefull.

It's not something I'd want to stall the release of WA5 over, but I would *REALLY* like to see some proper array management.<br>I'll be blunt - that arrayalloc() shit sucks major ass. Like I said before, if that gets implemented, people will start using that and then there'll be no way to change it. I know it'd be a lot of major work, and I appreciate that - you're only human (well, to us you're an uberhuman) - but I think trying to use a bad form of array management would be a really bad idea.<br>As for garbage collection, why not create an internal list of every $global created, and then when a preset is turned off, delete all $globals in that list? Or, when the preset is turned off, look through all the variables and delete all the ones that start with $ (or whatever other marking they'll get)?<br>Another thing I'd still like to see is a user-expandable varlib. I don't know if this is possible, and if it's not I'd like to see it expanded again, especially if we're gonna be using arrays. (I'm going to assume for now that array[5][5] will take up 25 variable slots, correct me if I'm wrong).<br><br><br>justin is k1ng!!1</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fragmer</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2003 00:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I think making one global array, like global variables, will be _realy_ good.<br>Global variables are almost ok, they'll be perfect if they could be accessed like this:<br></p><pre>
<code>reg( variable ) = value;  // set value<br>and blahblah = reg( variable );  // read value</code>
</pre><br>
      Or, if you'd like to continue using function only on the right side of equation, use this for setting value:<br>
      <pre>
<code>value = reg( variable );  // almost same thing</code>
</pre><br>
      It's like eval("reg"+number+"=blahblah"); stuff in other languages ;)<br>
      And to access arrays with standard syntax ( array[ level1 ][ level2 ] ) will be hard (impossabile?) to program in just a few days, I understand.<br>
      I thing one 1-dimentional array will be enough for the first time.<br>
      <br>
      P.S. maybe you don't want to do major stuff with AVS because it's free and doesn't do any good for you - maybe you should make a donation stuff, I'll give you 50$ or more if you do :)

      <p class="post-content">Now that someone mentioned it. I think loops might be much more useful than arrays. As for the infinite loop problem you have two choices, you could trust people not to send presets into an infinite loop. Or do what gaekwad2 said. I think the first would be better.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe a harder but overall better solution would be to put in some kind of feature that allows presets made by other people to use loops. But doesn't allow n00bs to use loops unless a checkbox in the display options is checked. That way n00bs who don't need loops simply can't use them unless the checkbox is on. Which would prevent idiots from accidentally sending there presets into infinite loops.</p>

      <p class="post-content">In Macromedia Flash, if a loop goes for too long (I think about 10 seconds) a popup comes up asking if you would like to abort the script. This happens every ten seconds if you select not to abort but the script is still looping. Perhaps this can be implemented in AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think arrays will be more useful than loops. I mean, loops are great, but priority of arrays is above loops.<br>
      Arrays will enable particle engines, complex random-scopes, complex flows etc. What major improvements can loops make? And - preset is recompiled at any change, every time you check a checkbox or type a symbol. Imagine that you're typing code and you didn't finish it and it's already compiled - and does infinite loop. Imagine how much harder it is to build loops (with standart syntax I mean) than arrays? I'm voting for arrays first!</p>

      <p class="post-content">arrrays aren't nothing without loops - they are just a bit less. You can still use arrays to draw a cube or something much easier - just use array[curr_pixel] to get the predefined vertice for the 3D figure.<br>
      <br>
      For example: square<br>
      INIT:<br>
      n=6;vertices[6][2]={{-1,-1},{-1,1},{1,1},{1,-1}};<br>
      FRAME:<br>
      q=0;<br>
      PIXEL:<br>
      x=vertices[q][0];y=vertices[q][1];<br>
      q=q+1;<br>
      <br>
      Then it would be really cool if matrix/array math was added. 3D rotation and just about everything would be a bit easier, although possibly not faster.</p>

      <p class="post-content">IMO, it's more important to get avs stable and to do some "small" improvementsto avs right now like multiline text and maybe some others to have a proper release ready for WA5.<br>
      <br>
      There's been so much progress that it might take me a few <b>months</b> to work all the stuff out i could do with those new features.<br>
      <br>
      I agree that arrays, looping and a better assignment structure are valueable but for now they're not nessecary.<br>
      <br>
      People have been messing around with avs for about 2 years without any changes, tweaking it to the max of its possibillities.<br>
      <br>
      Now, there's a flood of new stuff and peopel keep on asking for more although it's been barely used yet.<br>

      btw justin, it's really not that hard to make avs crash (or at least lock up). i've done it several times before. i can never repeat it, but it's entirely possible. all you really have to do is make it do a TON of slow operations all at once. you might even be able to do something like:<br>
      init: n=pow(w*h,2)<br>
      point: n=n+1;p=p+1;x=p*n*pow(-1,p)*cos(p);y=p*n*pow(-1,p)*sin(p);red=p/0;<br>
      <br>
      at some point i'll make a special "fuck you" preset that just crashes avs just for you justin ;)</p>
