Unconed was just using that as an example. Read what is being said before assuming something. If you did you would realize that live AVS was not actually discussed about, except in the context of a generic example.<br>Here is a quote from the FAQ on the main avs page. It's not that difficult to find. There are many threads on this topic.<br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by UnConeD</i><br><b>Question #10: I want to use AVS for live performances. How do I do this?<br><br>Yes you can use AVS or any other visualization for that matter for live sets:<br><br>All the info you need for this is here:<br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=64973" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=64973</a><br></b></blockquote><blockquote><i>Originally posted by fiveleaves</i><br><b>..., but if theres a better place to get info on this subject, like i said, pls link me.</b></blockquote>This has nothing to do with AVS, so I would post any questions that searching the Forums will not answer for you in a Winamp technical help forum. AVS merely runs off of whatever winamp is playing, so to get it to respond to live music, that live music has to be fed through winamp.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
