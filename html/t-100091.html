Nice effort though.<br><br>80's Style - Aah, an eyecandy... I like it more with the Custom BPM turned off.<br><br>Colored Dots - Crank the smooth transitions 1/3 way to fastest, instead of all the way to slowest. A bit nicer that way...

I like the fact that you really have a own style, something I REALLY miss by grandmasters such as El-Vis, UnConeD and the others (sorry for not-mentioning you all) it's just all the same (sorry if I hurt your feelings guys, but I have to stay honest)<br><br>Try experimentating with custom movements, that'll increase the looks of your presets a lot, start easy with some sin, cos, tan formula's<br>look around in my pack, it's downloadable on the forum<br><br>Greetings,<br><br>;-c</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th August 2002 21:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice presets... I have a few comments though:<br><br>- Some of presets are quite dark... I would suggest you make them brighter (ring of colored fire, race).<br><br>- The text in your intro is very small. Maybe you should use a larger font size.<br><br>- Try experimenting with colors more. When you use the colorfade, you automatically create a 'rainbow' preset. By using unique tones and multiplications, you can shift this color palette into something different and cool. For example, a unique tone with additive blue results in icey tones.<br><br>- I didn't quite like the text on "i am still alive". The background is neat though, try doing more with it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2002 00:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Intro - Same problem. The text function has a horrible glitch that fills the blue channel slightly, so additive blend doesn't work right, and replace blend makes the entire screen black (except for the slight blue fill and the text). To be used sparingly.<br><br>The Race - Sorry, but this idea is incredibly over used. And I happen to know about hyperspace, and this isn't it :P<br><br>I am Still Alive - Same text problem, and no noticable music response.<br><br>80's Style - Looks almost exactly like something I did a while back for my 'Drugs' pack...please, don't go looking for it, guys. But if you do, I believe the preset was named 'Took an Acid Trip, Fell on my Face.' (That was before I learned how to do things such as, say, morphing superscopes and moving whirlpools).<br><br>Colored Points - Another incredibly over used idea, but I can give you a bit of a tip: When blur is your only fader, use a Fadeout at it's lowest level. Otherwise the blur won't fade everything out all of the time.<br><br>Mad - Very basic, but not like anything I've ever seen, except that it sorta looks a little bit like Zen-X's 'Proper Filthy Naughty.' But not that much. I really like the colors<br><br>Ring of Colored Fire - Didn't do that much for me, but another tip: yellow isn't a built in variable. It looked like you were tring to randomize the color on beat, but since blue was always 1, it only went between blue and white. And you got your other variables mixed up, too. Try<br>beat:<br>cr=rand(100)/50; cg=rand(100)/50; cb=rand(100)/50;<br>frame:<br>red=cr; green=cg; blue=cb;<br><br>Looks like you have an overall feel for how AVS works, but you need to learn how to put effects together to get a desired outcome. Sort of like knowing your scales and modes but not knowing how to improvise ;)<br><br><br><br>BTW, rattaplan, the only 'master' of AVS without his own style is David Hansen.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Firedragon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2002 07:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>THX!</strong><br>@ Nic01: thanks, I will change a few things.
