      ok, before you download, this is not the whole pack, it's the forum release, this pack has been on my harddrive for a long time because my computer is fucked up (motherboard problems).<br />
      <br />
      so what i need is first a voulonteer that will help me with the hard part: collecting remixes &amp; nsis/pimp:ing the the pack plus makin a "promo pic" for the devart release. (*cough* tuggummi / atero / jheriko / degnic / nic01 *cough*)<br />
      <br />
      reason for why i'm asking for this is: i can't do this at the school comnp because i can't download/install anything on the comps and the the comps is just crap, they don't even haven soundcards so i can't work on any of my presets<br />
      <br />
      and also a lot of remixes, it can be from any of my packs if you want that. so go create.<br />
      and as i say on devart.com when releasing a pack: "enjoy"<br />
      <br />
      i will be taking a break from avs after this pack (this will maybe be my last pack)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a remix of Evilcookie - one of the three presets I thought needed work. The original "cylinder" movement should rotate or something...You also didn't really need the colorreduction or the last effect list; just lower the brightness levels and it's fine.<br />
      Also, "girlmiracle" is REALLY ugly. The basic concept is great - just MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.<br />
      The other one is amarain - the ssc+warp movement+water idea is a little simple, but it's implimented well here...only sort of needs work.<br />
      <br />
      Somehow I know you're going to whine about me saying all that. All I have to say is: I don't give a FUCK what you were "trying to go for". The point is to make good presets, and if it looks ugly it looks ugly - and that's all there is to it.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, the pack is absolutely excellent, though it's a little small. 4.5 star pack :)</p>
