I have a Dual-Core Athlon 64 4400+ and 4GB of OCZ Platinum 3200 DDR memory running in Dual-Channal and a Geforce 7800GTX using DirectX 9.0c(i am aware the graphics card does very little to improve performance). I have tried using the multiprocessor support but that makes no difference and when I look at the performance graph in task manager both cpu's are only getting about 60% usage. I have tried loads of different resolutions and they all stick at roughly the same framerate.<br><br>Ive had quite a few high performance pcs and allways had this problem with AVS am i doign something wrong?<br><br>Also the Alpha Blending option is greyed out yet my system supports it?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th November 2005 15:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">No matter how state of the art system you have, AVS will never run at resolutions beyond 640x480 it's safe to say i think. (unless the preset is a very specific one designed for high-resolutions)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">hornet777</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2005 06:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">AVS I call "the great equaliser" for the reasons Tuggummi just mentioned. I like AVS relatively low-tech approach, if for nothing else than its elegant simplicity. Kinda makes ya think twice about the motivations that made ya step on the technology merry-go-round in the first place, huh. The rest is left as a philosophical exercise for those inclined to do so.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2005 22:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Huh?

I'm not even sure Windows (prior to the new 64-bit version) correctly supports that much yet. I think 2 GB is the limit. (I've got 1 GB and even that's more than plenty.)<br><br>Perhaps it may be a good idea to check some of the Fullscreen settings in AVS. I've got two computers with WinAmp on them, and, on both of them, I've had pretty good results with the 640x480@32BPP mode with pixel doubling enabled.<br><br>I usually leave "Wait for retrace" and "page flipping" turned on for smoother animation, but you can turn them off for a slight performance gain. "Fast software bpp conversion" should probably be turned on, but I'm not sure if it even makes any difference when you have a 32-bit screen mode selected.<br><br>Note the "Rendering performance" slider. You probably want that all the way to the left.<br><br>Slightly less obvious is the options in WinAmp itself that can affect AVS performance. For example, in "General Preferences", you'll find an option called "Priority class". If you changed that to something other than "Normal", consider changing it back. Also, click on the "Plug-ins" category and look at the "Visualization plug-in priority" option. I have that set to "Normal" too, but you can try adjusting that to see if it makes any difference.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JFASI</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">22nd November 2005 01:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I use the fullscreen overlay mode, on account of how the alternative just crashes for me.
