Now what?</strong><br>Hi,<br>Thanks for the help for capturing avs presets and a link to the program to do it. Sadly, I'm not savvy enough to know what to do from there. Do I download\move it to the "plug-ins" folder in WinAmp3? Exactly how do I "open" and "insert" these things to capture a preset and make it an avi. file. Obviously I'm not a computer genius, but do know enough to follow "detailed" directions, if someone would be kind enough to hip me to that. After that, I can probably take it from there. Can I convert these to avi. files, then burn them to a DVD disc to play like regular video (without the transitions)? Any help would be largely appreciated.

I don't know how to operate that since i haven't used... tho you should still try to copy it to your avs folder and see if you can add it to a preset, but im not sure does it work like that. Tho it is an APE so there isn't any other way it even <b>could</b> work :D<br>[/edit]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">DJ Daniel</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd September 2003 12:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Still no luck finding the Misc.folder\AVS Grabber</strong><br>Tuggammi,<br>First of all. Major thanks for taking time for me. You of course are far more advanced than I, though I'm not without my areas of expertise (music composition\programming and live performance\improvisation). Still, after taking your advice, I opened a preset for capturing, from the Nullsoft folder (after a right click on the AVS screen), but was still unable to locate a "Misc. folder" in the avs editor or "AVS Grabber" to attach the saver.ape after an effect. Only found a Misc. Rendering and another similar one, in the settings\preset areas. I did put the saver.ape into the avs folder. I renamed it to AvsSaver.ape., so I could find it easier. That doesn't matter though, right?<br>Anyway, still no further along than before, although your willingness to extend a hand technically is greatly appreciated and admired. I'm hoping you'll stay with me until I get ontrack, and then I would gladly leave you be. Thanks again for the generosity thus far.<br>DjDaniel</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd September 2003 12:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Well my problem here giving advice on the saver ape is that i have never even downloaded it, yet alone used it :p<br><br>You could download the AVS Grabber APE by UnConeD from :<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1647293/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/1647293/</a><br><br>Then the above statements would apply, you just copy it to your avs folder, then look for it under the Misc effects folder in the editor and it should be there.

I got the AVS Grabber dialed up, but don't know how long to "grab" for before stopping the recording. I let it go for awhile, but when I stopped it, it said 0 frames were grabbed. I tried the same thing with saver.ape, (though only got it to playback partially in WMP) and I let it go for a long time, thinking it would stop at the end of it (if there even IS an end), and I ended up with a 4Gig file before I finally stopped it. Do these things keep cycling around and around endlessly? I'd like to burn the avi.files to DVD and play them back in a DVD player\display, so I suppose it doesn't matter if they are 32bit and uncompressed? Any ideas what I'm doing wrong, if my goals are possible,if they will still be cool without sound activation, and any further suggestions? Thanks once again.<br>DjDaniel</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd September 2003 17:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">AVS is merely a studio for making cool visualization presets. Most of them will be different every time. There is no "end" to the presets. Just record as much as you want to have.<br><br>I don't have AVS Grabber installed right now, but I have used it before. I can't tell you exactly what to do, but I have a few pointers. Don't use any sort of compression - just make sure it's set to no compression - it won't always work with compression. Also, make sure you go through ALL of the options. AVS Grabber does work - I used it to create my avatar.<br><br>[edit]AVS isn't really that great without music - the real beauty of it comes from its ability to react to music. There are other programs that can make much better visualizations that don't use music - if you want sweet visuals then use one of them.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd September 2003 09:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I just grabbed some stuff with the grabber from UnconeD and it worked fine :) Don't forget to select a compression method, and press the Grab! button ;)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
