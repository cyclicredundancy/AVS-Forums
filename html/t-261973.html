Or do what I do when I run out of ideas and am desperate to make a preset, follow this plan:<br><br>* take sphere superscope and play with parameters and equation<br>* take "played with sphere" and place it infront of a generic flow dm<br>* tweak<br>* add Jheriko super-ugly coloursâ„¢<br><br>EDIT: to go along with yat's advice I will quote some wonderful advice I was once given: "Smoke weed every day".</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th December 2006 13:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by jheriko</i><br><b>EDIT: to go along with yat's advice I will quote some wonderful advice I was once given: "Smoke weed every day".</b></blockquote>Are you sure it was advice?<br><br>Are you sure it wasn't a rap song?<br><br>I think it's important that you understand the difference.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th December 2006 13:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">for me it's usually like this:<br><br>I tinker with object A<br>I add effects b,c,d and e.<br>I tweak it a bit<br>I change the colors<br>I remove some small annoyances<br>I change some more effects and colors<br>Only <i>then</i> I find out that I have removed every object I started with and it looks nothing like whatever I had in my mind</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th December 2006 15:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by PAK-9</i><br><b>I think it's important that you understand the difference.</b></blockquote>Too late for that.<br><br><br>Your delivery reminded me of that classic Family Guy quote:<br><br>Peter: "I read a book on that once."<br>Brian: "Are you sure it was a book?"<br>Brian: "Are you sure it wasn't nothing."<br><br>I'm sure it was intentional :p</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nanakiwurkz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd December 2006 20:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">When it comes to my avsing i do it in this order.<br>1 think<br>2 think some more<br>3 finally start coding and make mistakes as i go along.<br>4 post pre-version on forums ie.
