      <p class="post-content"><strong>playing AVI-Movies within AVS</strong><br />
      hi.. - I´m experimenting with avi-movies within avs; sometimes the movies are big (about 50 MB) or uncompressed (a lot of data has to be read in a short amount of time); so I´m thinking about installing winamp3 on another hdd or on a hdd which is connected to a ata-raid card in order to have quicker access to the avi-movies; is it possible to install winamp3 into another installation-path; let´s say the primary partition of a second hdd (logical drive) ? or does winamp3 has to be installed into c:\programs\winamp3 ?<br />
      <br />
      thanks for any hints</p>

      <p class="post-content">1) don't use winamp3; i'd take the time to explain to you just why it's a peice of shit but it's not worth it<br />
      2) what's the point of using 50 mb avi files in avs? surely you're not trying to actually watch them...that's what mplayer2 is for. and you can't make any kind of preset out of them - if you're trying to, shame on you.<br />
      3) if you have avs 2.6.0, get 2.5(.1). the "upgrade" simply made it harder to use and crash more often.<br />
      4) the same amount of data has to be read whether they're uncompressed or not. when they're compressed it doesn't simply read less data, it has to decompress it and then use the exact same data that it would use had it been uncompressed.<br />
      5) someone who's computer literate enough to set up raid arrays should be smart enough to change the installation path of winamp when he's installing it :rolleyes:</p>

      <p class="post-content">1. thanks<br />
      2. lal ... no, I´m doing something different with it,<br />
      3. avs 251 works fine, didn´t even know about 260<br />
      4. sorry, but an uncompressed avi-movie of about 10 seconds with a size of lets say 200 mb means more work for the hdd, maybe less for the cpu (as the decompression has not to be done)<br />
      5. true true true - I know that you CAN install every prog in nearly every path - but some progs don´t like that (korinth: an old city with a meaning) - will be more exact next time .... ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">standar avi player of avi reali suck but i find this ape realy rock at <a href="http://www.forwind.net/pixelcorps/." target="_blank">http://www.forwind.net/pixelcorps/.</a><br />
      It's stable and fast (i play 3 movie in same preset and run at 60 fps) and have a lot of features like beat and freq reverse movie , beat and freq random jump of movie, beat &amp; freq return at the start of movie, the control of alpha and speed and more. It take same time for load movie in ram it depends of leigth of movie (i personaly use clips from 1 to 10 sec) but you can force realtime. It have same bugs. it work fine on my pc with movie 320 x 240 cinepak and uncompressed. if you make cinepak movie don't use the option "keyframe evry" and don't limit datarate because if evryframe it's a single image it can jump easy to evry part of movie and don't have information when play reverse. don't use mpeg based compression like divx or xvid beacause they have intraframe predicted frame. I personaly play in windowed at resolution 332 x 256 in overlay mode in second screen.<br />
      it have same bug about the resolution of winamp avs window and try to resize the window if you seem don't load the movie at 332*256 work to my pc perfect and always load all the movie. If you run at full screen it's better save preset and go fullscreen and reload it using y and u because it load in ram the movie at size of avs window and if you have the avi window bigger or smaller you will see the movies in fullscreen at the size of window.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It crash with clips aren't cinepak or uncompresed movies. i have last version of winamp but i use it under winamp 2 and different version of winamp 5. Look at <a href="http://onceagain.altervista.org/prova/html/clips1.htm" target="_blank">http://onceagain.altervista.org/prova/html/clips1.htm</a> there are 78 old clips i make with right compression. I hope you have adsl connection because i make page with gifs prew and evry page can be more of 1 mb for images.<br />
      Fell free to use all my material. There is a bug on 3d movies i output directly from 3d program. When you have one 3d clip load it will no load other 3d one because have same header but you can select the other one 3d and then duplicate the player or load a 2d clips and then the 3d. It can happened for some 2d one because i make it in same day from the same minidv.<br />
      If you need a free program for make avi compression search for virtual dub</p>
