Of course you will almost always pick an orthonormal system (which you still did). In 3D, the most common rule is the right-hand rule, but in 2D you usually pick whichever is easiest.<br><br>On my mechanics exam yesterday I picked a 2D coordinate system with the X,Y axes at 30° and 60° angles to the paper. Basically it was about a prism lying flat on the ground like this. On the sloped side on the left was a box, and the right a cylinder and both were connected with a rope over the top. The point was to calculate the speed of the three parts (box, prism and cylinder) given all the masses, friction coefficients, etc. I put my X,Y axes like this:<br></p><pre>
<code><br>(. = rope, [] = box, O = cylinder, * = pulley)<br>   .*.<br> . _-__.                   _-__  X<br>[]-    --O             Y _-    --__<br>-        ¯¯--           v          &gt;<br>¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯<br>(ph33r teh ASCIII ATR!!!11!!)<br></code>
</pre><br>
      Makes the assignment easier because the two objects on the slopes then move in either the X or Y direction rather than an odd angle.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I don't see why you'd lose so many points for that though. What are your teachers taking? If the actual contents of the graphs were right, it doesn't matter.<br>
      In fact, they're teaching math wrong. Math is nothing more than a set of chosen conventions, that are elaborately built upon. Some of these conventions are used to make things easier (e.g. putting your x,y axes at 90° angles and using the same scale on both) but some are purely arbitrary (e.g. which way the axes point, left-handed or right-handed). By taking away points for this they're showing they don't care about whether or not you understand math, but simply if you can reproduce the stupid graphs exactly the way they want you to reproduce them.<br>
      <br>
      (PS: right hand rule... extend your right hand so it's flat. Your thumb is the X axis, your fingers the Y. Now bend your fingers towards you so they are at 90° with your hand. They now point in the right-handed Z direction.)

      <p class="post-content">Ok, guys, here's the deal:<br>
      The education system in India is really fucked up.(atleast I think so).<br>
      This test wasnt in the school but in the tution classes. I was unhappy because if you dont score well, you wont get in Intensive Coaching, a special course to train the potential merit list holders.<br>
      And I was talking about the education system in India. I hate it. Firstly, you have to take all the subjects till 10th std. Then the competition is so intense that even 1/2 mark counts. The papers are corrected by the board (in X std) and the rules are sort of weird.<br>
      <br>
      I argued with the teacher a bit, but what she told was true. She told the "I can give you makrs now, but then the board examiners wont. If it werent for the inverted y-axis, you could have scored 25/25"<br>
      <br>
      And UnconeD, you are right, what they see if whether you can reproduce the stupid graphs exactly the way they want you to reproduce them.<br>
      <br>
      Magic: I live in Thane, a city very close to Mumbai, Maharashtra and Ishan lives in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. And no, the vacations start and end at almost the same time. hey are based on 1) the summer vacations - because of the intense heat. 2) Diwali, major festival of the hindus 3) Christmas - Not all schools have vacations, but we have for 12 days.<br>
      <br>
      Ishan: this test was in the tutions and the school has already started :)</p>
