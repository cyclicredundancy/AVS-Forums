      Ok according to the Visualnoobs team we need a compilation of presets and well i thought hey lets have a contest for the Intro.<br />
      <br />
      Rules:<br />
      1. the preset must look noobish but still be advanced<br />
      2. the Visualnoobs logo must be present in the comments or in the Visual your choice.<br />
      3 it must render at speeds of 10 fps or over slight unders of fps will be accepted minimum is 7 fps.<br />
      <br />
      ok and have fun<br />
      the winner will have his/her preset as the Intro for the Pack.</p>

      I forgot what the visualnoobs logo is.<br />
      <br />
      Welcome to Visualnoobs.<br />
      we here at Visualnoobs have but one purpose.<br />
      To help in the learning process of those who have just started using Avs.<br />
      We do so by providing Tutorials and presets made by the pros but in a easy to understand way.<br />
      <br />
      pretty much the only thing you need is Welcome to Visualnoobs.<br />
      <br />
      also i made a example.<br />
      <br />
      oh i almost forgot.:p<br />
      The presets will be judged in a voting system Based on originality,Imagination,Character.<br />
      <br />
      the entry acceptence part will be open for 5 days starting today.<br />
      <br />
      after that any preset submitted after the 5 days will be looked at but not entered into the contest.<br />
      <br />
      sorry if i sound demanding i assure you this is no scheme like the last contest i attempted hosted.<br />
      <br />
      My example is not an entry.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>sorry</strong><br />
      I guess i got carryed away again. if you would like i'll end the contest. Thanks for the comment Jheriko. The Sphere and Moebius Strip took me some time to convert into avs from a neat little prog called k3d-surf. it uses the same calculations algo like avs but the way they have the data entered is what made it hell for me to figure out. i would like to know in one of the formulas they use ^2 how do i translate into avs. also there is on some instances where it uses -pi,pi thats another that drove me insane. but i did manage to make a spirograph Klein Bottle.<br />
      <br />
      anyway thats off topic. ASD5A sorry for the mishap. and WoTL i'm terribly sorry. i use a offline comp and forget to remember some of the members of Visualnoobs. Jheriko sorry for involving you. Would you like to be a member? also i'll let you guys decide what i should do about the contest. i'll stop the days required to submit and reset when a compromise is reached.<br />
      <br />
      4 days left has been suspened.</p>

      <p class="post-content">^ is usually power in noobie languages, it is usually XOR in manly languages.<br />
      <br />
      e.g. pow(x,2) = x*x = sqr(x)<br />
      <br />
      btw I worked out parameterisations for all the shapes you just mentioned without any software. Consider this method to create a parameterisation of a mobius strip:<br />
      <br />
      the mobius strip is just the family of straight lines that spins around the circle and rotates with the circle we can start to create this by making a line segment in the x-axis and rotating it around the circle e.g. x = R + r*u, for u = -1 to 1. I've uses similar notation as is normally used with torii where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.<br />
      <br />
      We introduce a new parameter v for rotating around the circlular path and use the familiar rotation matrix. v = -pi to pi, or 0 to 2pi<br />
      <br />
      x = (R + r*u)*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      y = (R + r*u)*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      <br />
      this produces a disk with a hole in the 2d plane.<br />
      <br />
      now to make the disk twisted we must rotate the original line in the xz plane before applying the step above. (i've done it in this order so that it should be easier to visualise why this 'last' step works)<br />
      <br />
      we recycle v since we want one twist per rotation of the circle so we have:<br />
      <br />
      (original line with twist)<br />
      x = (R + r*u)*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      z = (R + r*u)*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      <br />
      (mobius strip - twisted line rotated around circle)<br />
      <br />
      x = (R + r*u)*cos(v)*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      y = (R + r*u)*cos(v)*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      z = (R + r*u)*sin(v)<br />
      <br />
      I'm going to write a vb program to test this now since i can't dl avs here :/<br />
      <br />
      brb<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: I forgot to account for the shifting of the original line! So the above produces some figure 8 pattern!<br />
      <br />
      (original line with twist)<br />
      x = (R + r*u)*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      z = (R + r*u)*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      <br />
      should have been<br />
      <br />
      x = R + r*u*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      z = R + r*u*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      <br />
      this is because we want to rotate around the middle of the line to twist it, rather than the origin, which sweeps out a sort of sheet with it instead.<br />
      <br />
      this makes the final part:<br />
      <br />
      (mobius strip - twisted line rotated around circle)<br />
      <br />
      x = (R + r*u*cos(v))*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      y = (R + r*u*cos(v))*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      z = R + r*u*sin(v)<br />
      <br />
      This sort of method can be extended to any shape which can be thought of of dragging some simpler shape through a path. The sphere, torus, various klein bottle projections etc.. can all be worked out methodically like this. The sphere for instance is just the circle x = cos(u), y = sin(u) rotated around x:<br />
      <br />
      x = cos(u)<br />
      y = sin(u)*cos(v) [ - 0*sin(v) ]<br />
      z = sin(u)*sin(v) [ + 0*cos(v) ]<br />
      <br />
      Hope this is useful.<br />
      <br />
      EDIT2: all the pi's for the parameter ranges come from using radians (2pi) rather than degrees (360) for angles. this is quite normal in maths/physics because it simplifies many expressions (such as the taylor series expansion for sin/cos). this is usually confusing when people first start programming since its rare for an intrinsic sin/cos/tan function to use degrees whilst before high school level degrees are all that is used in maths</p>

      My work is definately going to improve from the beautifully detailed lecture. thanks a bunch Jheriko. I do have one request can you make a easy to understand tut on how to calculate trig,geom,calc into avs? this would come in real handy for those who have the math skills but don't know how to translate to avs. and again sorry. let me know about that entry. and thanks about the com again. I've been working with my Octahedron shape in MrNudge V9<br />
      Proxy Firewall(Nanakiwurkz) remix and i made a cube from the code. took eight sscs but it was worth it. wish i could optimise from 97 equals to only 8 -_-' well back to the think cap on that one. tinkering is my only skill and as you can see it works out real nice. and again sorry about this lamo contest i'll start it back up when everyone is ready.</p>

      <br />
      You do realise exactly how expansive these subjects are? Also how marginally useful calculus is for AVS? Teaching people how to translate math to AVS is difficult too, generally it means that they don't understand the basics of coding i.e such complicated ideas as "its a list of instructions that get executed in order" and "= means that what is on the left of = gets set to what is on the right of =". The rest of it can't be taught because it requires the ability to work something out from (almost) scratch anyway...<br />
      <br />
      There are plenty of tutorials around already if you look for them anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe if you ask me something specific, and reasonable, I might help.
