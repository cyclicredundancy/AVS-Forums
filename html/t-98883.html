Actually the word "wow" seems too weak to describe your pack. You seriously ought to think about getting a job working with animated space scenes.<br><br>Have you ever seen Titan A.E.? (It's been out for quite a long time, so you'll probably have to rent it. I'm not sure if movies made in the USA are available in Europe or not, but I hope so. It's a cool movie. Your preset 05 Speeder 3K kind of reminded me of a scene from that movie.<br><br>Both Tie Tunnel presets were great! I wanted to laugh thinking of them shooting at Luke.<br><br>Water Cube was quite impressive. Really reminded me of Bryce. I *almost* want to laugh at your usage of the word "simple!" :D<br><br>Zero G Maze II---"Which tunnel!?! Which one!?! The insanely cool one!"<br><br>"Which insanely cool one?"<br><br>"I don't know! They all look insanely cool!"<br><br>Reflectocube: You seriously ought to go into making screen savers! It'd be nice if there could a program to convert AVS files into a regular screen saver (not one that's based on .avi files...one that actually performs the calculations as it goes). That'd be pretty hard, though.<br><br>Digital Nebulae: kind of reminds me of the Aurora Borealis from Whacko AVS Pack III---inspiring and incredibly groovy (I'm seriously getting into the problem of not descriptive enough words)<br><br>Source II---outstanding ripples. That ripple effect would make an outstanding dance floor.<br><br>Of course it's 5+ star material. (Not surprising-probably 5+++ or more)<br><br>I can't believe it's actually here! No joke!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nic01</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th August 2002 08:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">:eek: :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek: :eek:<br><br>(Not to spam, but I think that's all I needed to say)<br><br>If this doesn't get Daily Deviation on DevART, something's very wrong with the staffs...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dylman</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th August 2002 23:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Congratulations on another outstanding piece of work. :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zevensoft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">15th August 2002 11:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Wow, good job on most of those presets...

First of all, where'd that avatar come from, Steven? It's too cool, but what'd you use to make it? Hey-even from someone who's straight, I thought the original fat Mr. Happy was hilarious. It's just the bowling pin effect where it looks like he's about to fall constantly, and you're just waiting for someone or something to come hit him and knock him---the same thing discussed in your old thread Mr. Happy.<br><br>Rova: Mrs. Happy? That I would have to see. It'd be funnier if you could put both of them together and call it "Straight Mr. &amp; Mrs. Happy," but that'd be way to slow of a framerate.
