      Is there visualization that shows simple moving bars that reflect music like one you see on top of winamp main window when playing audio file?<br />
      <br />
      Without any 3d's or effects, or if there is no then tell me if theres any of this kind.</p>

      <p class="post-content">as far as i know no one's made a preset like that because it's just so simple and boring. it shouldn't be too hard to make. i'd give it a shot but i'd get stuck on the peak falloff part.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not as easy as it seems.<br />
      True, it isn't the most difficult concept, but if you also want to use the same coloring method, you need to define the colors both in x and in y.<br />
      <br />
      But still, it'd be boring.<br />

      </blockquote>Wow cool, just as i wanted, though could it be larger squares like in winamp window, what i mean currently you havelike 100 small dont, what about 20 dots or so and shape as rectangle..., and option to disable fall off. Thx.<br />

      If i was to make this visual for you.<br />
      will you give me a idea of other effects you want or do you just want a plain vis based off the winamp visualization box.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, I was remaking my one with what you suggested but during this time I downloaded Mr Nudge's actual one.<br />
      Which is pretty much what your after, although I do include an improved version of my original preset. (It also has the option to toggle peaks with a click)<br />
      The preset I was making at the time.<br />
      Also something from an improved version of my old (only) AVS pack which I hope you will like.</p>

      </blockquote>Thanks for your work. Simple_spec_with_falloff_meh.avs is what i was looking for though both your and Mr_Nudge have some defect they dont act like this bar in winamp window, if you watch AVS and winamp window bar while listening to intense music you can see right side of bar in winamp goes up and in avs it does not.<br />
      Also maybe write so you could select how many bars you want e.g. if you add more than now they tighten. Also when you going full screen it does not fit full screen<br />
      <br />
      Sry my english i am actually russian.

      </blockquote>Actualy yes. it is possible.<br />
      but there are two ways to do the background.<br />
      one would be to make a solid super scope that you can change the color of your self. or the use of trans effects like Unique Tone and Channel Shift but each of the two causes major consumption of fps and is not normally soumething i like to do.<br />
      as for the superscopes. I can easily rig a color color code set up that changes them.<br />
      <br />
      Heres a base i made for you with out the falling peaks and the effects. I'll work on it when i get home and post your actual request later.<br />
      but for now learn from the base i provide.<br />
      oh and anyone who knows how to perfectly detect the same spectrum data the visualization in the skin does please tell me. p.s. the (pow(spec*reg05,spec2*reg05)); is just something i came up with.<br />
      it appears to be very useful for the time being.
