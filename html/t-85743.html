      im pretty new to avs so any help is appreciated. I dont under stand the super scope very well yet and i learn best by looking at an example, but most examples i find are to complex for me to understand yet.if anyone could provide a few simple examples it would help alot. i have made a few unique but weak ass presets if you want to see them, email me at <a href="mailto:skater348@attbi.com">skater348@attbi.com</a>.</p>

      <br />
      init:<br />
      n=200;<br />
      <br />
      per pixel :<br />
      x=2*i-1;<br />
      y=v<br />
      <br />
      That makes a horizontal line that reflects what the spectrum data (I think) looks like.<br />
      <br />
      i = point on scope, ranges from 0 to 1<br />
      v = value for any given point, ranges from -1 to 1<br />
      x = x :)<br />
      y = y :)<br />
      <br />
      After that, it's just messing 'till you come up with something nice.<br />

      this renders a circle with a midpoint of (0,0) and a radius of 1. To scale it down, mutliply the x and y by a decimal...<br />
      <br />
      x=cos(i*6.283)*.5;<br />
      y=sin(i*6.283)*.5<br />

      <p class="post-content">Another circle :<br />
      <br />
      Init : n=500;pi=acos(-1)<br />
      Point :<br />
      x=sin(i*pi*2);<br />
      y=cos(i*pi*2)<br />
      <br />
      This makes a circle which touches the edges of the screen.<br />
      You can add dividing sign at the end of the appropriate line and also put in an appropriate number to make the circle smaller.<br />
      To change location, simply use + or - sign.<br />
      Note the "n" value - it is the number of points - you might want to change it into smaller number while the SSC still resembles a circle.<br />
      <br />
      How to put a dynamically moving SSC, with the diameter of 1/5 of the screen :<br />
      <br />
      PerFrame : t=t+0.1;<br />
      Perpoint :<br />
      x=sin(i*pi*2)/5+sin(t);<br />
      y=cos(i*pi*2)/5+cos(t);<br />
      <br />
      Now the SSC moves in circular pattern.<br />
      <br />
      How to make solid circle, w/o movement (1/5 size, like the moving one) :<br />
      <br />
      Init : pi=acos(-1);n=w*pi/5<br />
      PerPoint :<br />
      x=sin(i*pi*2)/5*s;<br />
      y=sin(i*pi*2)/5*s;<br />
      s=bnot(s);<br />
      <br />
      There! You have a solid circle (Though slows down AVS quite nicely...)<br />
      <br />
      You might want to add misc/rendermode to set the line width, in case it isn't solid.<br />
      <br />
      You can also do *(s+getosc(0,0.1,0)) in each line instead of *s for a little funky thing =)<br />
      <br />
      Good luck in yar SSC making career! (And especially good luck for AVS making career)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Artists that I'd recommend to ask for about SSC :<br />
      <br />
      Nixa - In his/her :p preset named "Lots of Spirals" (Or something like that) It looks somewhat basic-ish. But if you dig in the preset, you'll realize that all six spirals are drawn using only 1 SSC.<br />
      I hadn't tried to decode the SSC - Quite dense of a code in it =)<br />
      But then, I think I can make one using a different way...<br />
      <br />
      El-Vis - Need I say more? He made a ton of 3d SSCs!<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD - This one don't need an explanation, either. If you do, download his 4th pack, and try the preset "All Neon-Like".<br />
      Everything in that preset are SSCs (Except for the needed buffer safe...).<br />
      Even the STARS are SSC! (Synchronicity is essential, ya know - creates realism)<br />
      <br />
      The various AVS artist on the board - They're helpful, trust me =)<br />
      <br />
      Me! - :p<br />
      <br />
      Just PM one of us, and we'll help :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Also to make a perfect circle, not oval, I divide x and y by (w*s) and (h*s) where as s invertedly equals the size of the render and w is the width and h is the height.<br />
      <br />
      Init:<br />
      n=400; s=.015<br />
      Per point:<br />
      x=(cos(i*6.28)/(w*s));<br />
      y=(sin(i*6.28)/(h*s))<br />
      <br />
      now the shape will stay circular even though the avs box could be rectangular, the only thing is division is slower than muliplication.<br />
      <br />
      so use this<br />
      Init:<br />
      n=400; s=.015; xa=1/(w*s); ya=1/(h*s);<br />
      Per point:<br />
      x=(cos(i*6.28)*xa);<br />
      y=(sin(i*6.28)*ya);<br />
      <br />
      ok I'm going to sleep, dont know if any of this actually does something, but mess with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">A tip for both you and NoSage :<br />
      <br />
      In the init, type "pi=acos(-1)"<br />
      This way, you can save your mind from remembering those numbers - You can replace 6.28(It's actually longer than that) with pi*2...<br />
      <br />
      ____<br />
      <br />
      You can make Solid SSC by either using "s=bnot(s)" or linewidth, but the "s=bnot(s)" conforms to any form of SSC... It slows down AVS more tho...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here's a better explanation of the solid superscope principle... Nic01 got the main trick across, but failed to explain the whole idea:<br />
      <br />
      A Superscope can only draw lines or dots. So, to draw a solid shape, you need to draw a lot of lines that overlap just enough. The reason you can use something like s=bnot(s), is because it performs a binary 'not' operation. This means 'true' becomes 'false', and 'false' becomes 'true', so the variable s alternates for every point.<br />
      <br />
      Knowing that, you can write a superscope that draws a regular line, and add a shift to the 'y' coordinate based on 's'. For example:<br />
      <br />
      x=i*2-1;<br />
      y=if(s,.5,-.5);<br />
      s=bnot(s);<br />
      <br />
      Now you have a solid rectangle (given that 'n' and/or line width is high enough).<br />
      Another thing that I just thought of, is that AVS draws vertical and horizontal lines much faster than sloped ones. If you look at the above code for low 'n' values (n &lt; 100), you can see that the result consists of sloped lines.<br />
      If you replace the code with this, half of them become vertical, and it should provide a minor speedup. Not sure exactly how much, but anything is something :). Though optimizing more complex SSC's to draw like this should be *quite* a difficult task.<br />
      <br />
      onframe: x=-1;<br />
      onpoint:<br />
      xx=i*2-1;<br />
      x=if(s,xx,x);<br />
      y=if(s,.5,-.5);<br />
      s=bnot(s);</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually nic01, i try to stay away from acos(-1) because it equals 3.14159265... which is alot more numbers for avs to calculate than 3.1415 and unless the render needs to be extremely accurate, i think it can speed it up a tad.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nosage: sorry but your theory about 3.14 being faster than 3.1415... is not right, AVS uses the same floating point type for all its data (not sure if it's 32-bit or 64-bit types). And a CPU multiplies (1.5 * 2.5) just as fast as (1.3543411111 * 2.659533).<br />
      <br />
      And of course, a CPU uses binary, so a fraction is made by summing negative powers of 2 (.5, .25, .125, .0625, ...), just like we use negative powers of 10 (.1, .01, .001, ...).<br />
      Just like we can't write 1/3th in decimal (the digits go on and on), other straight-forward fractions can't be represented by a finite number of digits in binary.<br />
      <br />
      Fractions are weird. For example: 0.9999999999... = 1<br />
      <br />
      x = .999999...<br />
      10x = 9.99999...<br />
      10x = 9 + x<br />
      10x - x = 9<br />
      9x = 9<br />
      x = 1<br />
      <br />
      :) :D<br />
      <br />
      As far as the boolean operations go, you can construct nand and nor routines by using a combination of AND/OR/NOT, as the article says :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's got to do with the number of conversions required to covert it to addition and subtraction (which is all a computer can do really).
