      <p class="post-content">hey MJ,<br />
      <br />
      just cuz you tried and asked, I figgered I'd offer my opinion.<br />
      here are some notes as i watch a random selection...<br />
      <br />
      test system: AMD 1600+ 512Mb ASUS v7100 twinview<br />
      muzak: crystal method - tweekend<br />
      <br />
      6: nice colours, a little too fast in zoom<br />
      9: like it but dont know why<br />
      10: like cosmos effect<br />
      12: like roto star scope effect in 12(like one of those electro-static balls in trashy sci-fi movies) and the timescope makes some interesting effects (try a blend filter)<br />
      13: nice for trancy trax, long particle blend again, i like it.<br />
      18: like the trans out and the roto in on beat, prefer mosaic on blend 50/50, subtler<br />
      20: something in the horiz split is disturbing<br />
      22: hmmm, like the outline effect of scope, but not the jumping around, the scope is already busy enuf.<br />
      25: is the sorta thing i like with lotsa blending and sexy colors, ditch the simple scopes.<br />
      globe: is interesting becuase of the mix b/w scope and globe reflections<br />
      <br />
      i didn't comment on every preset, just the ones i thought noteworty. i'm putting together collections for party viz, so i approach it from the dancing audience perspective zoning into hard trance or d&amp;b.<br />
      <br />
      hope this helps you to produce some kick ass viz, there's some stiff competition out there ;)<br />

      <p class="post-content">maryjane, maryjane, maryjane,<br />
      what to say, what to say<br />
      <br />
      first of all i'd like you to listen to me when i say "blend"<br />
      i got really irritated by scopes and other stuff was clashing<br />
      it's not pleasant for the eye,<br />
      but since you are a n00b, i'll give you some advice<br />
      1. use some fades once in a while<br />
      2. blend, clashing objects is not plesant<br />
      3. varation, i think i saw many presets that was <b>exactly</b> like each other<br />
      4. some of your scopes was not (how should i say it) good, they wasn't useful in some presets<br />
      <br />
      other than that, your presets was alright</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay im doping my review for it even though people gave their opinions on what to add, but what the hell...<br />
      1-17 pretty good for someone whos new to AVSing, could use Trans/Fadeout a little bit here and there.<br />
      18 looked like something from my first 5 packs ^_^<br />
      19 it almost looked like you had a subtractive blend it it, but it was just only but a black Rander/simple, but i could show how to do one of them if you want.<br />
      20-21-22 were okay, still absense of a blur effect (but dont get my screen name wrong on this one :D)<br />
      23 i liked the colors on this one, but the fourth effects list didnt have anything in it nor did it have any effect on the preset... :\<br />
      25 this one i liked too, the colors of the rander\moving particles in the back and the two reander/simple in front, giving out a kinda a peak bars and all.<br />
      27 started that one up, BLANK SCREEN?! then HELLO! dot planes! :D<br />
      Globe: great now i need to get my 3d rander objects again :hang:<br />
      <br />
