      This is to announce my retirement from AVS, effective immediately.<br />
      <br />
      Several factors have contributed to this decision, and let me say that it wasn't an easy one to make. But unfortunately, the fact remains that I'm just no longer interested or excited by the prospect of constructing more presets. Perhaps the break I took after I released the MiniPaks went too long, but there was probably no stopping this train anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Believe me, I really tried to start work on Immersion, but nothing came of it. And that's not taking into account the fact that I just can't get my head around the more complicated concepts of AVS, such as raytracing, that I really wanted to implement.<br />
      <br />
      So instead of rehashing the same old visuals (however well they were originally received) with the limits set by my not-so-stellar knowledge of the mechanics of AVS, I'll save you all the boredom of being handed Radiance: the Sequel and call it a day right here.<br />
      <br />
      Besides, I'm just too busy to keep up with the community anyway. My uni workload is ever increasing, and I need to commit all the time I can to maintaining an average that doesn't suck.<br />
      <br />
      But who knows what the future will hold. Maybe this is just a phase. Maybe I'll put my all into learning new skills, and return with a new cutting-edge pack that'll rank up there with the best of them. But probably not.<br />
      <br />
      Well, it was fun while it lasted, and I've had a wonderful journey over these last three or four years, from Just the Basics to Hall of Sound 2. See you all later.</p>
