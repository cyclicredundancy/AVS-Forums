I've said it before and I'll say it again... 'Give us the AVS source'.<br><br>People may say that opensourcing AVS will be a bad idea.. but take a look at NSIS... thats been open sourced and theres no development issues there.. and NSIS2 is quickly becoming a very powerful tool... much more powerful than the original NSIS. Why can't we do the same with AVS? I think we should ask Nullsoft for this, I'm sure many of us would like to trawl through the code and fix stuff/add stuff and maybe even integrate existing APEs into AVS. Theres also this entire forum to go through to find stuff to add/tweak/change. I'm sure that if a group of us banded together and asked Nullsoft for this they would agree.<br><br>So.. who's with me?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaak</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd September 2003 17:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I agree...<br>We just can not live longer with a 2 years old winamp original vis.

It is just actions speak loader than words and I was just stating, if we are being truely honest with ourselves, that the devolpment is very unlikely to continue. I thought with Ryan at Nullsoft there he might have chance to update it but alas that is not the case now.<br><br>Just because I am a mod on teh forum doesn't mean that Nullsoft talk to us. Nullsoft staff post about once every few months. And then normally not about anything as trivial in their minds as visualizations. *sigh* :(<br><br>Actually I was hoping (ok I wasn't hoping more dreaming....) that someone from Nullsoft may come and reassure us here after seeing that post but alas not.<br><br>AVS Open SOuce yeah culd be I know Nullsoft like taht sort of thing but with the Waste fiasco resently (I think Ryan took a lot of time off writing vis stuff to be involved in that, I presume it was that non-visual project he was assigned to) maybe Open SOurce isn't high oN AOL's list of things to make money.<br><br>It would be a great project though. Although I do honestly feel with 3d technology in there it could be a pain to really push the power of it. It would be great to see the code though. ALthough it is so old it probably has roman numerials in there instead of base 10 numbers. :);)<br><br>Well yeah I am behind it but as I know more than ost what Nullsoft are like don't expect too much.
