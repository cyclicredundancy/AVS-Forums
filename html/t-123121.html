      Hello !<br />
      I am curently building my new pack and i ran out of inspiration at this preset...Some thing is missing and i have no idea what to put more.Any suggestions are welcomed and,of course,credits will be put at the "comments" area :)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content">First off. Just download winzip if you don't already have it and zip the files instead of renaming them. This gets annoying.<br />
      For the preset:<br />
      Try cutting down the number of SSC's. That is way too many.<br />
      The background is kinda nice, but could use a bit more.<br />
      The flames are awful(no offense). Use something dynamic, not static. These flames are always the same, and making the SSC change color on beat doesn't help much either.<br />
      Flames can make a good intro, but this has been done several times before. Hope this all helps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">First off, dont do that whole renaming thing, to people who dont know how to un-hide file extensions this is the biggest pain in the ass, just use winzip, second off annubis is right if they are supposed to be flames, they dont look in the slightest like flames, third off, how about something like this, ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">That looks nice Raz, but why didn't you make the background start from the top? Also, change the blend mode so you can't see the different SSCs intersecting. It's also not incredibly dynamic.</p>

      <p class="post-content">when it starts from the top on my comp it just looked like it went down half the page then faded out and it was just a 2 minute mess, couldnt be bothered making it better, just wanted to put across my basic idea. Again, with the dynamic-ness just a mess, leave the actual work to phaze considering its his preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice tug. Love how the letters move around and the background starts from the top too(having it change speeds some would be nice, phaze).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for all the remixes and suggestions.To clear things up :<br />
      1.I forgot i cant put *.avs files and winzip was too many clicks away so i renamed...but i had no idea i did it twice :) Also i didnt want flames,i was testing different movements and i liked the way parts of the letters move backwards and forwards ;) Anubis you`ll see the intro when i finish the pack...its very cartoon-like :P<br />
      2.Wow...i couldnt decide which preset is better from the one tug and raz made...so i made 2 presets containing variations...Changed the speed of the DM and some onbeat actions too anubis:)<br />
      3.Do you guys go on IRC ? Quakenet, Undernet ?<br />
      Again many thanks...Hope you could see i improved my coding skills :)<br />
      <br />
      Regards, Phaze</p>
