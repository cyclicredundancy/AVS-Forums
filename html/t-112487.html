A bit cliched, but nice overall. 2.5/5<br><b>Kiss:</b> Now THIS is original! Great work. I can't for the life of me figure out how the hell you did that. 3.5/5<br><b>Moving twisting and spiralling scope:</b> A cool mix of n00b and beyond with the simple MPs and the complex movement. Interesting is all I can say. 2.5/5<br><b>New moving twisting and spiralling scope:</b> This is a good improvement on the original. Perhaps a bit too "staccato" (not a very good way of saying it, is it?). 2.5/5<br><b>Optical - Squashed Fly:</b> Very good coding, and an awesome output! Still, some additional dynamics wouldn't have hurt. 3/5<br><b>Optical Ring:</b> Again, this preset just doesn't do enough. It is okay though. 2/5<br><b>Optical Scope:</b> Interesting use of colours, and the DM was a fine example of coding. Dynamics are slightly better. 3/5<br><b>Radioactive B:</b> I think you're cabaple of better than this. 1.5/5<br><b>Relax:</b> Very relaxing indeed. Sometimes the preset SSCs are just better. Great job with this! 3.5/5<br><b>Shifted Scope:</b> The "layered" colours give a great effect, even if the movement is overused. 3/5<br><b>Soft Yellow:</b> Quite true, the easier is sometimes the better, as this shows. I would've put the mirror at the top, but that's just me. 3/5<br><b>Burning scope and snow:</b> That's quite a contrast, but it makes for a good preset. The MP flashes in the centre of the screen are also a nice touch. 2.5/5<br><b>In my mind:</b> The dynamics in this one are definitely better. The feedback around the main renders are especially well made. 3.5/5<br><b>Classic non-rect DM:</b> An extremely nice pattern! Very relaxing, and a great example of code. 4/5<br><b>Angel Of Darkness:</b> This is a great preset. I'm not sure what the Convolution Filter was doing that a blur couldn't, but anyway. Great use of colour again. 4/5<br><b>Optical - Landscape:</b> Fairly plain, but a nice looking preset nonetheless. BTW, you can use pi=acos(-1) instead of 3.14159... 3/5<br><br><b>The verdict:</b> A very nice pack in places. Some things to remember: use dynamics a lot more. Nothing is more boring than a static preset. And keep coding! You had some very nice pieces of code in here, so keep at it! Overall, a pretty good pack.<br><br><b>Aesthetics:</b> :) :) :) :( :(<br><b>Originality:</b> :) :) :) :( :( 1/2<br><b>Overall:</b> :) :) :) :( :( 1/2</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th November 2002 17:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">thanks a lot for the detailed review.
