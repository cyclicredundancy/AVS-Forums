      <p class="post-content"><strong>2600/ AVS/ Who is diabolik?</strong><br />
      I do not know if anyone read the (so-called) hacking quaterly 2600. The magizine that was once a useful resource in my younger days 'playing' with 'hacking' but now more a social injustice rant about DMCA, DeCSS, et all and letters pages. For Â£4.89 no less in the Uk!<br />
      <br />
      Anyway (my rant over) it has this quater (well the latest over here in the uk) - Spring 2002 - an 'article' on AVS and creating 3d presets. God only what it has to do with 2600 and hacking but anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Now although I do not have any 3d glasses so I cannot check out what diabolik has written.<br />
      <br />
      I wanted to know<br />
      a) does it work?<br />
      b) and what do you think the of 3d presets?<br />
      c) Who is diabolik? Aren't all the AVS presets writers all friends and post here?!? :confused::):p:rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      but d) most of all does this person know anything about AVS at all.<br />
      <br />
      In What you will need<br />
      <br />
      (</p>

      <blockquote>
        A computer (....you should have a pretty good video card..)
      </blockquote>No wonder people keep posting the 'why is AVS slow' threads.:confused: :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Now I cannot be bothered typing all the preset in at the moment but it is worth at least reading the article if you can.<br />
      <br />
      Now there is a link to the preset but it does not work infact wosre than that it opens4 or 5 random adverts so no point posting it here. Which makes it even more annoying.<br />

      <p class="post-content">2600 is an american magizine. I sold all over the world a popular computer mag. Sorry I presumed everyone would know what it was :o(you will probably not know who 'hacker' Kevin Mitnick is either too).<br />
      It has been going since the early 80's (2600 refers to old school phone phreaking) so maybe I am just too old.:)<br />
      <br />
      you should have no problem picking it up all over Canada.<br />
      <br />
      see the website.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.2600.com" target="_blank">www.2600.com</a><br />
      <br />
      if you really need to you could order online<br />
      <br />
      The AVS article is just a one off but you may find it interesting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm doesn't sound too advanced (with the 'fast video card' reference) and especially when it's in a hacking magazine. Isn't 2600 more related to phreaking and cracking though?<br />
      <br />
      In any case I don't have 2600 and don't intend to purchase one just for one AVS article :p. Do you have a scanner? :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">On scanner I am afraid. Otherwise I would do that. Sorry. If you are in a newsagents it is worth checking out. it is only 2 small pages of A5.<br />
      <br />
      BTW I really have no idea what 2600 is about nowadays. It just calls itself 'The Hackers Quaterly' but it has outdone itself with the AVS 3d article about lack of relevance.:confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>which 2600 issue?</strong><br />
      I usually try to get every 2600 when it comes out, I must've missed that one. I could use that article.<br />
      <br />
      2600 did tend to rant on and on about the decss and other shite, but it actually has a boatload of useful information. For those who are interested, any Bibelot book store would have a copy, or even Border's Books. It runs about $5 a pop, but I try to get mine at a 5 finger discount.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well the technique is very easy... just render the same image twice with the camera moved slightly to the left/right for the left/right eye, and of course one in red and the other in cyan. I tried it once with The Source in Whacko AVS II, it looks pretty cool, but not many people have those cheezy glasses :).</p>

      Now, if only the "The Hackers' Quarterly" would just go really hacker-like and actually do some programming...<br />

      Oh yeah, they're hackers, not mathematicians. Experts on guess-and-checking HUGE amount of possibilities.<br />
