      <p class="post-content">Ohh... first comment on a newbie preset!<br />
      <br />
      Pretty basic, but that's to be expected. I see you've played a bit with the spiral superscope, that's good. Playing is the best way to learn. Once you learn a bit more, wonderful things can be done.<br />
      <br />
      I personally like more movement in my presets. I tend toward dynamic, but not chaotic presets. Something that I can chill to, yet can really pumped off of.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just one hint: don't do simple+water+rotoblitter presets! We have seen them about 10 000 times :D<br />
      Other than that welcome to the wonderful world of avs, don't expect to learn everything in a day (or in 6 months), but when you learn it really pays off!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey, I like this preset. It manages to be chaotic but also visibly responsive. And bonus if it's your first time.<br />

      <p class="post-content">wow, that is nice for a firsttimer<br />
      <br />
      my first one (lost in a hard drive purge :() was hella lame<br />
      <br />
      i think it was a couple moving particles in water with a ripped DM<br />
      <br />
      and it still looked stupid<br />
      <br />
      :)<br />
      <br />
      so, dobenos, good luck here, and remember, use the search function and the FAQ too</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very good for a first preset, I think you've already grasped the key to AVS which is to make everything with code, most newbie presets tend to be things like a moving particle and a dot fountain and a blitter feedback, or some shash like that. Keep experimenting and tinkering with the code side of things and your skills will grow. :)<br />
      <br />
      Keep making them. :up:<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: Oh yeah, and feel free to rip apart any of my superscopes or DM's to see how to do things. In fact I recommend trying to figure out code made by others, its a good way to learn.</p>

      <br />
      I agree heavily, the only thing worse than 'coloured puke' presets is when someone thinks that they have progressed beyond being a noob and they release a pack with 30 presets that all look like spinning tablecloths or wallpaper patterns, normally using some really poor 'r=r+0.05;' type movement and thinking that that is what other people consider code.<br />
      <br />
      I pride myself in the fact that my first avs pack contained 3D sscs and dms (even though they were superweak) as well as some noobish work. :D

      <p class="post-content">Alright! I'm no longer the biggest n00b on this board anymore! ;)<br />
      <br />
      Welcome man, enjoy your stay here. :) I guarantee you this place will help you become a better avs maker... Just post anything you think has some new elements not in your previous presets and ask whether they think you've improved any. It's working for me :up:<br />
      <br />
      I recommend you visit the following post:<br />
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661&amp;pagenumber=1" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....1&amp;pagenumber=1</a><br />
      <br />
      Later on you'll see Nic01 give you a short tutorial on basic coding using movements. It will help you tremendously :)<br />
      <br />
      And remember, make sure all your presets react in some way with music. My pet peev is a preset that does not do anything to the music. It totally defeats the purpose of an avs imo... Anything else you could do in flash :p</p>
