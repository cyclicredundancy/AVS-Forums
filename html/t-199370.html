You should be able to select different display adapters and change the screen resolution (in order to view AVS on a separate video card). It would be great for parties if you had dual-monitors or a monitor and projector layout or or even S-Video out. (i.e. It would be sweet to have two (or more) monitors and have one show ONLY Winamp and edit the playlists, etcetera on one monitor and have AVS playing fullscreen all the time on a separate screen.)<br><br>I am currently limited to MilkDrop to perform this and I would like to broaden the horizon and be able to use the versitility of AVS.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Mr_Nudge</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th November 2004 04:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I'm sure there is a way to do this already.

Spam. Well if you say so. Please accept my apologies<br>2. I actually appreciate your feedback. This color schemes are not made by professional and there was simply no time for me to get deeper into this subject as I was busy with everything else. Little bit later I am going to dedicate much more attention to this particular area.
