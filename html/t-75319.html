Feel free to use my remix. If you want to increase the number of spirals (as suggested by loungeroom), increase the number d is being divided by in the last dynamic movement.<br><br>BTW, you don't have to give me credit if you understand how I added the fog and can reproduce it in other presets. Just a quick thanks for teaching you a new technique will suffice.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">lessthanjakeguy</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th February 2002 04:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ok cool we will be useing that in our first pack when we are finished......i found the thing for the spirals out a couple of hours ago and sent it to underoath lol great minds think alike(i think it looks best at 30 but underoath likes it the way it is now so what do you think is best?).....also i thought the superscope was alittle basic so i made a picture to go with it that makes it totally disco lol...the picture is 162 kb uncompressed..but 1.3 kb compressed:D so anyway here is the stuff hope ya like it too....see yah</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th February 2002 07:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Very cool...
