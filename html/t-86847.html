Yesterday I decided to get the latest version (I have been using 2.78c). It worked alright, then it started locking up when I started it, and the music would cut out while running AVS though the visuals kept going. I downgraded to 2.79 and it started up fine, but the AVS thing still happened. I went back to 2.78 and it works fine.<br><br>Anyone else have something like that happen?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2002 08:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Maybe the newer version has lower-sized buffers by default? I'm really not sure... the version list only mentions this:<br><br>2.80<br>- fixed drag and drop from open file dialog related bugs<br>- made CDDB support better handle not-found CDs/lack of CDDB installed<br>- update to CDDB ui (bugfix)<br>- new splash screen<br>- minibrowser security fix<br>- included PP's hacks for slightly better unicode filename support<br>- in_wave support for floating point .WAV files fixed<br>- better win9x compatibility for DirectSound<br>- waveOut made skip less<br>- some in_mod per-file fixes<br>- OGG Vorbis support for Standard and Full installs<br><br>2.79<br>- upgraded unzip/decompress support to zlib 1.1.4, for big security fix<br>- improved multiple instance detection code/opening many files from explorer issues<br>- winamp agent tooltip improvement<br>- updates to MIDI support, disk writing support, WAV file support (PP)<br>- fix to id3v2+unicode support (rOn)<br><br><br>I'm experiencing some more AVS weirdness too by the way. I have a preset which works perfectly when winamp is not playing music, but as soon as I click the play button, AVS crashes. I don't have it on this computer though, but I'm going to send it in next weekend to see if you guys have the same problem.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">goebish</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2002 13:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">a friend of mine report the same problem with 2.79 and 2.80 so I continue using 2.78....</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th May 2002 17:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">UnConeD:<br>You could just be using too many variables. I've experienced a lot of trouble when I'm writing SS or DM code, as AVS keeps every variable that has been created in it's memory, even if it's not being used. That means if you change all your variable names, AVS keeps the old ones in it's memory - and if it's something like from "wxpri" to "iwxt" you get "wxpr," "wxp," "wx," and "wxt" all stored in your memory. Try doing that with 6 of them and all of the sudden Winamp crashes (even though Winamp and AVS are both still running).<br><br>But that applies to using too many in general. When I was trying to optimize a whirlpool-movement (like yours in Comotose Enlightenment) which was using 4 sets of coordinates, Winamp crashed, then when I tried to open it again, it still crashed - but it only crashed on the first beat when a lot of the variables were being initialized. I had to go into the actual source code and edit it there so I didn't lose the work.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th May 2002 05:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I figured that was the problem, but all of my variables are normally initialized in the init.

I just tried plugging your code into a preset and it worked fine though.<br><br>What I do know is that line-superscopes can sometimes slow down when you give them huge out-of-bound values (this can happen with 3D SSCs when you don't check if the z coordinate is close to 0).
