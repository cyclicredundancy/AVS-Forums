      Well howabout it? Forums are designed for question asking/answering which makes for less <b>intuitive</b> (be careful how you interperate that) access to knowledge. A stable - permanent knowledge base could be quite useful to new and even experienced learners. A place to download packs, view tuturials - primers - tips - apes - anything avs.<br />
      I can source webspace and help with the coding (time permitting).<br />
      <br />
      New users will go to a website before going to a forum which would keep this area a little less uncluttered with repeat questions.<br />
      <br />
      Theres a strong community here and theres alot of people out there who want to be a part of it all. Im not going to bother without active participation from you all - in fact I might not even have time to do it. Who's up?</p>

      I only know basic html &amp; a very little css... :hang:<br />
      <br />
      Tho if the website is not suppose to be <b>dynamic</b> i could try to make it, but it would require manual uptading in the future (meaning that i do pages with a text editor-like programm without any automagic functions)</p>

      <p class="post-content">good idea, then we could stickie the link and route the newbies to a knowledge base.<br />
      <br />
      I have enough experience (mostly Dreamweaer) with my own HP to get it on, shouldnt be a prob if it is only html - based. If you want to do that using something like a read-only php forum, it would be quite difficult, but better to handle for those who want to add stuff without upload everything.<br />
      <br />
      Another idea would be a newsgroup with some daily tips ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Me and my mate have been building a website for about 6 months now. It's a music site and all we have to do ebeforewe release is get together advertising and bulk up content for a bit. It has a whole assload of music related things on it and if i can convince him i could add an avs section for the site. Don't worry about the quality of the actual site it completely rules, so to speak and it would be a good boost if it were part of a site that relates to a few different things, more people would learn avs and the like. I'll see if i can persuade him but i'm not promising anything.</p>

      I could put up a Wiki on acko.net if you want it. That way I don't need to intervene.<br />

      The CMS that ran on acko (******) has a collaborative book feature that allows people to compose a book, modify existing pages, approve new stuff, etc. Basically a more structured version of a Wiki.</p>

      <p class="post-content">OK sounds goooood. I guess all we need is content - who's up?<br />
      <br />
      There will need to be tutorials on:<br />
      - The Basic GUI &amp; Getting Started<br />
      - Simple Dynamic Movement<br />
      - Advanced Dynamic Movement<br />
      - Simple Superscopes<br />
      - 3d Superscopes<br />
      - Movement<br />
      - Writting apes<br />
      - Anything else??<br />
      <br />
      The best way to tackle these would be to take the reader step by step through one or two projects. A simple project to explain the basic concepts. Then another to explain a little more in depth.<br />
      It won't be a recipe book - so you'll need to explain how/why/what/where in an easy to understand manner. Mathematic explanations could be tricky. I can help out with your writting skills - we don't want twenty page essays.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And most importantly - we need a good domain name. Any suggestions?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'd like to host on acko.net however I think a dedicated avs site is required? The wiki solution is looking quite good for pack uploads/tips and tricks... I dont think its appropriate for the general content. That content will need to be moderated and controlled to ensure the site retains good structure (and doesn't get messy).<br />
      <br />
      However tips and tricks definately need to be recorded and setup for intuitive access and that may/may not need to be moderated.<br />

      <p class="post-content">im not saying that you are unstable in the axe murdering, pschychotic sence of the word, just that you have greater things to worry about such as study and what not, and cant be expected to host a reasonably active site all by your self.<br />
      <br />
      I think its a brilliant idea if you wanted to have it at ack.net, that way you could also put in as much as you wanted and no more. BTW, i remember coming across some of youre posts on a html coders board a while ago (when i went through my web developer stage), i got the feeling that you know your stuff.<br />

      Ok, facts:<br />
      <br />
      -there are enough possibillities to get free webspace<br />
      -there are enough people, willing to contribute<br />
      <br />
      conclusion: we can put up a simple avs site (simple only for the start, goes bigger and more complex as developing)<br />
      <br />
      If i get some time i'll work out a frameset and a design in the meantime we gotta get a stickie "AVS Website Content" thread in here<br />
      <br />
      I know, somewhen i'll be struck up in my multiple projects, but if you guys really want, i'll put up the site and share the ftp account with those who worked on it too for updates.</p>

      <br />
      since i havnt checked any free hosters since geocities back in 1997, i'm not really up-to-date regarding free hosters. usually they suck (&gt; bad speed, pop-ups).

      <p class="post-content">Tug, thats what i already said. Devart and the Seve Wittens Pack can be unstickied as they are not of general purpose (IMO).<br />
      <br />
      Killahbite, i dont want to put up a wiki or anything like that. I'd rather like to start with a little house than the empire state building. A good website with a collection of tips and tricks in normal html will do it, later on we still can change this and expand the site.<br />
      <br />
      Considering free webspace, i got a host for mine with 25 megs, no ads or pops. This should be fairly enough for starting the project.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thats right mx - the only content that needs to be uploaded is new avs packs (if they really need to be included at all). Theres no need for discussion groups and forums etc - although maybe later on perhaps.<br />

      <p class="post-content">yah.. css is not neccesarly to do with frames or layers, but it can work with both. It is just a way of customising most features of html code.<br />
      most common usage in real life is just costomisng text, like making hyperlinks different, so that they arnt underlined, or so that they change font when mousovered. And those pages with costomed scroll bars are also css.<br />
      <br />
      You specify your css stuff in one spot, and then refer to it later when you want to use it. its like making html 'presets' that you can refer to easily.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just make sure you don't tie the CSS to form but rather function. Use a cascading structure that encompasses your entire page and goes down to the smallest distinction.<br />
      <br />
      E.g.<br />
      <br />
      body { ... }<br />
      #header { ... }<br />
      #header a { ... }<br />
      #sidebar { ... }<br />
      #sidebar.box { ... }<br />
      <br />
      All too often you see people who claim they use CSS, and still end up putting class="..." in every &lt;a&gt; tag or similar. That's just stupid.</p>

The blue text in the top right is a java applet and the menus on the sides are automatically added using css. I've talked to darren and he agrees that we can use the basic design in it because it will be a subdomain of rockworld. It doesn't look much like this but it's much better with the header on it. I'll post another screenshot with the header when i get one but this is all i can find on mine for now. By the way the loading time with everything is only a few seconds on the home page. All images are gifs and the setup uses the minimum ammount of images possible.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Magic.X: Never trust regular users to produce remotely accurate translations. They will commonly:<br />
      - Use different translations for english computer-words than the 'common standard' (e.g. your OS)<br />
      - Contain hints of dialect and grammar errors.<br />
      - Never be updated because the person who did it just felt bored those 5 minutes and isn't interested anymore.<br />
      - Get forked as people disagree over what words to use (just search for 'francais, français, french' or 'italian, italiano' on this site and count the results).<br />

      anyway, before talking of translating content (and i agree with unconed on this idea) you better produce content first. i don't see anything happen on this issue.<br />
      <br />
      my personal opinion is, that raz should give the people user-accounts, so they can upload their content at will. this will motivate people to start and motivate others to follow. waiting will change nothing (or at least not much).</p>

      <p class="post-content">look, isn't this website (at least the AVS part) just going to be a glorified <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567" target="_blank">FAQ</a> with some downloads? That was the impression i got from the original post.<br />
      <br />
      Why is anyone even bothering talking about translations into other languages or user accounts with automated file uploads into computer generated databases? Why is there a forum? There isn't even any content yet. In fact, there isn't even a webpage online yet. It's all just vapor. With all the time some of you guys have spent dreaming about the ubersite that will make all other forms of entertainment obsolete, you could have a simple HTML page that details most of the concepts of avs for newbs (UnConeD has practically written everything already... you just have to search) and includes a few essential downloads and links. Every month or so the admin could take the bits of new material he'd recieved and slap it into the appropriate section. After you've got something simple like that, if you think it's necissary, you can worry about beginning to add user accounts and graphics and crap like that and integrate it with the stuff raz has.<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps I went a little overboard in my rant, but just do something and put some content or something somewhere. It seems like Raz is waiting for all the perfect content to be available and Those Who Write Content are waiting for Raz to put his perfect site up.<br />
      <br />
      Here, I made just a <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~michael_obrien/wsb/html/example.html" target="_blank">very crude beginning</a> of an idea for content in a poorly programmed webpage, if you could call it programming. It definately didn't take any more than half an hour. I also used a lot of UnConeD's stuff without asking. It (the webpage) is clearly not very much, but it's more than anyone else has produced in the way of content. If anyone has any suggestions about the site's organization I'd be glad to hear them. Even better, actual articles. Once I have more time I can put some slightly less basic HTML in (actual links and organized content) but this page will either be integrated with raz's design or will be forgotten so I won't spruce it up very much.<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: I hope you'll agree to let your stuff to be used in my crummy thing and any future renditions. You would/will always be cited clearly and I'd remove it any time if you said so.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I was aware that you had a domain name and pretty bits that would go around the words and a forum. I didn't know you had a design for the organization of the content but apparently you do. anyways, one of my main points was that you can use what we already have for now: the explanations that UnConeD has written, El-Vis's 3d scope engine and explanation, other explanations like in the Tips and Tricks post, Atero's primer, common APEs, and things that I can't think of right now. All you need is to ask permission of the authors and then HTMLize the text. It isn't like you need a re-write of everything that's already been explained: you just need it organized on a web page for newbs to look at. My beef was that you were busy programming forums and setting up foreign language lessons when you practically have all you need, especially if you have everything but the articles/files worked out. Maybe I didn't express myself very clearly.</p>

      cut the first six words of UnConeD out. There you go, article. I understood it and I'm just a dumb kid. It covers everything in reasonable detail if you already understand 3d scopes which you should if you're going to tackle ray tracing.<br />
      <br />
      edit: also, el-vis's engine is mentioned in almost all of the threads that I know of that involve explaining 3d scopes. It's just something for newbs to plug numbers into when they first get interested in 3d scopes. but if it isn't perfect enough then don't use it, whatever. It was just a suggestion.

      <p class="post-content">OK, here are five promising articles from other people. I don't have any author permission whatsoever yet, but i'm asking. Coding for dummies especially has a TON of info, but I think it might be better if it were split into multiple articles and was edited to be a little more professional and article-like. Anyways I'll talk to Nic01 about it. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes of editing to make it polished enough. Gradients by tugg could be renamed something like "how to create basic background gradients" because just calling it gradients seems too vague or something.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, etc. The authors should give input on what they might want to change to turn it into an article, not me. Hopefully nobody has any problems with re using their stuff and the final versions could be given to Raz in a few days.<br />

I also included the developer preset the explanation was dericed from, and the finished one. It's pretty much more of the same with some optimizations and a rotation matrix.</p>

      there's also an edited version, because some of the grammar was bad and some of the writing didn't make sense out of context. I also put the code into a SSC, but I don't know if that's necissary... some newbs might not understand how to increase line size to make scope solid. Again, I don't have permission yet.<br />

      <p class="post-content">arrgh i wrote a fairly big thing and it went kaboom.<br />
      <br />
      any ways, anubis: very nice. Now criticism:<br />
      <br />
      the variable i should be written differently. perhaps put it in parentheses so you can tell the difference between:<br />
      <br />
      one time (i) went to the market.<br />
      one time I went to the market.<br />
      <br />
      it's just a little confusing the way you have it, it distracts from reading the article.<br />
      <br />
      Also, use spell check. It's worth it.<br />
      <br />
      finally, your definition of r is wrong. r is the measure of the angle <u>counter clockwise</u> from the <u>positive x axis</u> to an imaginary ray that starts at the origin and intersects the point. The positive x axis is a ray that starts at the origin and points to the right. I know that you know what r is, but your description wasn't precise and could have many meanings.<br />
      <br />
      r is commonly referred to as theta. You should mention that because if the reader has used theta in math class then he'll get what you're saying. The angle that you described would probably be referred to as alpha.<br />
      <br />
      You need to use pictures to describe polar coords, otherwise stupid newbs won't understand.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for giving me a good way of describing r. I was having trouble coming up with a way of putting it in words(a problem I often have). Like I said - I haven't finished(as you can probably tell by it ending mid-sentence:p ), so I haven't gone back to check everything again(spelling, coherence, ability to properly explain everything, etc.). I am open to any and all criticisms so that, hopefully, more people will understand AVS better and will be able to make some fresher presets(I'm going to die if I see another preset with just firewurx and a roto blitter) And I know pictures will help - I just don't want to take the time to make them.:p<br />
      <br />
      Also, once I finish discussing all of the different functions, I am going to go into more advanced topics(except for things like ray-tracing which I am not terrific at, and which already have excellent tutorials being written for them).</p>

      explanation:<br />
      <br />
      d = length of \<br />
      <br />
      r = the angle, going counter clockwise, from the positive x axis to the distance. in this example, r is approximately two radians or approximately 120 degrees. (120 degrees does not equal 2 radians, it equals 2.094395102 radians, so it's very close.)<br />
      <br />
      just put that into your article with a font that doesn't screw it up.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, here is my final article. I fixed some bad parts and organized it a little better. I also put it in word for some reason. It isn't totally perfect, but that's all I'm gonna do for now. BTW Raz, as far as I know your aspect ratio fix is wrong. It's x=x*w/h. This is because DMs take the color of the pixel from the x value you specify and places it on the original pixel, not the other way around like SSCs do. If you don't believe me, open up my preset, stretch your AVS window out into a long rectangle, and try changing it to your way. It'll look really weird and stretchy.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, also the big black box in the upper left: It's twice the height it needs to be in order to contain the text that's inside of it. Do you really need the number of lyrics, reviews, tablature, and CD covers to be posted in the AVS section of the site?<br />
      <br />
      One more thing: It needs a border. All the text is smooshed against the side of the window. Just focusing on the upper left edge makes it look like the page stretches off into the distance. You need clearly defined boundaries on any kind of design or it just doesn't look right. Trust me, I took an art class once (from a really good teacher, not some half assed art docent), I know these things. Besides, people are going to accidentally click the links on the right when they try to scroll down.<br />
      <br />
      actually, this site has a lack of boundaries elsewhere. The "lyrics, reviews, tablature, and CD covers" thing is floating in space and the advertisement is too. It's sort've like they don't quite know where they should be. Or maybe I need to take my crazy pills.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Big black box, when it's smaller it looks ten times worse, trust me, i've spent about 6 months working and learning and working and changing and arsing about and it looks better like that.<br />
      <br />
      I really, really, don't agree with you on the borders, for two reasons, one, i don't see your point at all, i think it would look toss with the borders and two, the right border, left border, header and footer are inputted through css and i'll be damned if i'm going to change all that to add a bit of a border.<br />
      <br />
      Haven't shifted the lyrics cdcovers crap yet from the design, it wont be there. I really don't see where you're coming from on the advertisement either, looks fine where it is to me.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>err, what you're saying is change the example?<br />
      I said in the alpha blending section that essentially you could blend it how you like it... I dunno why you would use ik though, as ik hasn't been normalized... it's almost accurate though, I suppose there wouldn't be noticable problems.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      <br />
      Edit: Actually, (i'm assuming you're going for a "fade off into the distance" effect), I just thought about it and ik is really inaccurate...

      <p class="post-content">rand() to getosc(): I most of the time do that, indeed for synching reasons, though if you're new and want to learn it, rand() looks les scary than getosc(). I haven't updated my rotation matrix, because I hardly know anything about 3D maths, and it already was a bitch to write for me. (see the forums: tips &amp; tricks 2 - beginner and intermediate only). It's all explained to me there, and so is point-to-point scoping.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Legohead, thanks but it's alright, the loading time on a 56k for that site is 1 frikking second over 56k, now i think that's damn good. I wouldn't want to spoil it with textures and whatnot. Do we really need an intro? If so i'll be up for putting it in, the main Rock World site has a flash intro page so it wouldn't be problematic to do. And i'm hosting it on the same domain as the Rock World site (wise considering it's near enough the same style) anyway so no domain help needed.<br />

      </blockquote>what are you talking about?<br />
      <br />
      all raz is saying is to do this:<br />
      <br />
      <pre>
<code><br />frame:<br />sx=sin(x);<br />cx=cos(x);<br />sy=sin(y);<br />cy=cos(y);<br />sz=sin(z);<br />cz=cos(z);<br /><br />pixel:<br />x2=x1*sz-y1*cz; <br />y2=x1*cz+y1*sz; <br />z2=x2*cy+z1*sy; <br />x3=x2*sy-z1*cy; <br />y3=y2*sx-z2*cx; <br />z3=y2*cx+z2*sx; <br /></code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      It has nothing to do with the matrices, it's just defining some variables in per frame so they don't have to be calculated every pixel.

      And you can have too many articles - when it becomes difficult to find what you are looking for, you have too many articles. Mathworld is a great example. Although it does have some great info on it, it does get extremely difficult to find certain things because of the massive number of articles it has. If you search for one thing, you may get 20 different articles that you have to go through to find what you're looking for.</p>

      AVS is used by many porn sites as a user/password service. Winamp made a sweet program using the same basic principles that creates some kick-ass visuals. AVS is not affiliated with Wild Tangent in any way, shape, or form.<br />

I told you I had only asked once to try to clear up any misconceptions, and then you posted that huge block of monkey dung.

      <br />
      Intro.<br />
      <br />
      Welcome to the world of advanced visualisation studio . This neat little site was created voluntarily by a nucleaus of enthusiasts - who are inundated with repeat - "noobish" questions that eat up our regular forums. If you're a beginner or advanced user - you should be able to find answers to 99.99259% of your questions right here. Use it wisely :) and don't expect to be "SPOON FED" everytime you get stuck. Problem solving 90% of what avs is all about.<br />
      <br />
      [B]You'll be creating amazing presets before you know it![B]<br />
      <br />
      Although it may seem a little extreme at first, it really isn't difficult to learn avs. Here are the secrets to becoming an expert avser:<br />
      <br />
      a) OBSERVE - presets you enjoy. Start out simple and play around with simple settings at first. What gives what effect? What if I change that?<br />
      b) READ - the tutorials on this site and find out why that happens and how it was done. Again - start out simple.<br />
      c) FOLLOW - the tutorials on this site so you can start building your own presets from scratch.<br />
      d) EXPERIMENT - with settings and variables to make your own unique presets.<br />
      e) REPEAT - if you get stuck and try some problem solving!<br />
      <br />
      Look foward to seeing some great presets from you! Good luck!</p>

      I still like mine (of course) :).<br />
      <br />
      a) do we need to explain what avs is? (How did they get to our site)<br />
      b) do we need to explain that there are tutorials etc - when they are quite clearly on the sidebar menu.<br />
      c) we need to tell people some basic ideologies - so they dont' end up back here within 2 minutes clogging the forums (that was what we where aiming to overcome??)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway - thats my 2c worth. Im heading off on a huge road trip shortly. Look forward to seeing the final result. Good work RAZ.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the AVS site is going to be a subdomain of Raz's new site (rockworld.org or .co.uk), which will attract more attention. Thus, visitors will see a link to "AVS", so an explanation is necessary. Tutorial explanations are also necessary for the same reason- what is a superscope? what do i use it for?</p>
