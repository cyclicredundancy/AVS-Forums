      <p class="post-content"><strong>oh</strong><br />
      okay....so those are just variables u asign things too....:D<br />
      dman tutorial i was reading had me thinking it was on of the defualts, some body should fix that ...<br />
      the website is in the first forum b4 this one it says AVS Tutorial or sometin like that..the website is koo but the info is bad.....:mad:<br />
      <br />
      lol..<br />
      <br />
      oh i've been looking at other pples presets to learn more about dm's and such and i've got a pretty good understanding of it.....but theres still one thing that puzzles me.....<br />
      when i look at a code it may have 2 y's or 2 x's some even have 3....when i say y and x's i mean variables....but why can u asign two y's wont the second y be useless or just mess up ur code?<br />
      maybe there using differnt formula's? like polar or quadratic ?:confused:</p>

      d=if(equal(ct%3,1),d*(sin(x*bt1+fr)*bt+1.5),d);<br />
      d=if(equal(ct%3,2),d*(sin(y*bt1+fr)*bt+1.5),d);<br />
      r=r+sr<br />
      <br />

        <p class="post-content">All that matters is what the variables are at the end of all the caluculations. If you take the previous changes you made into account, it's all good. If you didn't, then the unexpected happens.<br />
        <br />
        As to the different boxes, here's my take:<br />
        <br />
        <font color="red">Init</font>: This stuff that only happens once, at the beginnig of the preset. It's a good place to set your constants and initialize variables.<br />
        <br />
        <font color="red">Per Frame</font>: Here is the stuff you only want to be done each time there's a new frame. If, for example, you want to shift everything one way, or reset a variable that you use in your perpixel section, this is the place to do it. Everything in here is calculated only once for each frame.<br />
        <br />
        <font color="red">On Beat</font>: Like per frame, but with beats instead of frames.<br />
        <br />
        <font color="red">Per Point</font>: The stuff the affects each control point. If any values chage between you points (which I'm sure they do, otherwise it'll be boring :) ), this is where you do it. The variable <font color="blue">i</font> (in superscopes) lets you determine which point of the scope you're affecting.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Evaluation order is: Init, Frame, Beat, Point. It's the only one that really makes sence.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        :up: Hope it helps. :up:</p>

        <p class="post-content">Feathers of Insanity : Not bad... Seems like you're starting to get along w/ Alpha blending...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Add /4 after all colorcode, Line Width=2, Heavy blur.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Sun : What in the... A bit "chaotic" (Not exactly the right word)... Not attractive...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Seems like the preset works fine w/ deepest list of lists toned down to 2 lists.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Sun Remix : A bit less chaotic, I sorta like the effect (It takes time tho, and a good viewer), not attractive...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Delete useless fadeout in 1st effect list, look at preference for "Sun".<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Jungle of Tri's - Weeeeiiiirrrdd.... Need a little more work on attractiveness. I must admit, nice effect....<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Linewidth = 1, Heavy Blur at bottom.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Pink Flower - Kinda boring, not <i>that</i> attractive, too.<br />
        <br />
        My Preference : Blur moved to the bottom and changed into heavy.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Loc Les Monster Lake - Kinda boring, sorta like the effect, WAY slow!<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Set the fx list containing starfield to Additive output.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Red Just-Mixing - Eh? Definately not the best. Kinda n00b-ish looking...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : In the last FX list, replace DMs with fadeout that's placed over the simple (not below it), set it to 5/6 full power.<br />
        At first list, change the alpha blend from d*3 to d*2.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Dancing Floor (Inverted) - Nice! Better than the ones before, that's for sure!<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Hmm, I'd have to think a little more to get a better effect...<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Hawaii Soldier - Eh? Nice work on movement and DM...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Crank the bumpiness of the bump to da max.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Hawaii Soldier (Change of Colors) - Haven't I seen this before? Pretty much Hawaii Soldier w/ the bump cranked up...<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Learn the basics of Solid SSC and you'll replace that simple with a color morphing SSC in no time.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        My Try 2 3D - Not bad for a "try"!<br />
        <br />
        My preference : Crank interleave size to max, set to gray, set to additive.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        My Try 4 3D (Second 1) - Nice job! GOOD job!<br />
        Wait a sec...<br />
        That's the exact same effect I saw in 2 (Or 3) of the presets in Tonic's 4th pack...<br />
        You didn't steal, dontya?<br />
        <br />
        *Compares the movement*<br />
        <br />
        WTF, exact same copy...<br />
        <br />
        My Preference : Learn.<br />
        <br />
        -<br />
        <br />
        Room of Blue : :huh:<br />
        Nice...<br />

Though it doesn't state anywhere that these are default variables, perhaps I should clarify that on the site.:)</p>

        thanks for making that clear for me....:) u said that d and r are not defualts but its used alot and it means d= distance and r=rotation and iz and ix are also not defualts but are often used so what may they stand for?.........<br />
