The only problem is i haven't found anything that will automatically switch between presets (i mean there are soo many that are good).

Better randomisation (it tends to repeat the same ones) - actually I heard a suggestion for the songs playlists that makes sense. Make the computer drop any preset it's already played out of the random list. Then, once it's played them all, It can put them back in, and start over, randomly, of course)<br><br>2. Hotkeys for Plugin sets - I don't think it would be that hard to do. You can already set a hotkey to a specific preset, which is really usefull. But even more usefull would be being able to set hotkeys for specific preset directories, with the push of a button, you switch from random mode running one set of presets to another, without having to go into the presets/hotkeys menu at all..<br><br>The randomiser works well if you select "ALL" meaning all of your presets (if you have a lot), but on smaller preset-lists, it tends to repeat the same ones. I'm going to solve this by manually building directories the way i want them to play, but having those fuctions would make it so much easier..<br><br>Does this sound good to anyone else or is it just me?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LittleBuddy88</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th September 2001 17:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I agree, it sounds really cool.<br>This would mean easier viewing of packs, and maybe add the current preset(the one you might be working on) to the playlist so you won't lose it.<br><br><br>Linus</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">transfrmr</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th September 2001 20:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>OH YEAH!!</strong><br>I forgot that one...
