The size of the packs were of great issue and discussion in the previous compilations, however reduction was never needed. Keeping in style, if the amount of original presets becomes too large a system of reduction can be discussed.<br><br>However with only 5 people so far, this may not be needed. I'm hoping for at least a few more than this! Where's Tugg, JFASI, StevenRoy? I've seen Zamuz, Synth-C and Yath popping in from time to time. There surely must be a few more people who would like to participate! So come on, folks!<br><br>Well first and foremost, I would like to set a deadline for the original presets, which is: <b>March 12</b>. "March 12?!", I hear you ask. Well, 39 days seemed like a nice number. Not only that, February is the shortest month so I wanted to have it be a bit longer than that. And not only that, my break from school begins the following day. Therefor, I'll have time to organize all the presets and send out the submissions for remixing.<br><br>By March 17, you should all have received your originals for remixing. The deadline and the plans for the remixes will be released and discussed at this time. I had planned for April 13, but if more time is needed it is certainly negotiable, as is anything else in this post. If anyone is unhappy with what I've suggested, please feel free to say so! If more time is needed for anything, or if anyone has any other things they would like to suggest, I'm always open for ideas!<br><br>So as the last compilations, anyone wishing to join should send no more than <b>two (2)</b> presets to <b>winamp.forums[at]gmail[dot]com</b> by <b>March 12</b>.<br><br>Finally, have fun, but remain diligent! March will be here before you know it!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Grandchild</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st February 2006 21:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yay, off we go!<br><br>btw: KarmAVS looked promising too.

(I'm still proud of that one.) I've been working on ideas for a new intro (complete with new custom font!), but I think I'd be lucky to get that working right in time for WFC6.<br><br>Anyway, I've actually got three WFC4 presets -nearly- ready to send in. Since I still have some time, though, I'm going to continue looking for ways to tweak and improve them a bit.

I looked back at the previous compilations and did a D'oh!<br><br>JFASI: Huh? As in today? I'm confused, but excited.<br><br>Grandchild: I'm really looking forward to your presets. I haven't seen too much of your work, but I'm always hearing good reviews about you. :)<br><br>On to other matters: Would anyone be willing to write an installer for the pack? I believe Jheriko had mentioned, in WotL's forums, that he would do it, but if he's no longer able to we could find someone else. If all else fails, Pimpbot should suffice.<br><br>Also, I was thinking of redesigning the images previously used for the packs. Meaning, at deviantART and Winamp.com, when you see the link to click on the pack, and the larger image used to display the preview of sort, and the opening image of the installer. I'm not sure what to call these, but I think you know what I'm talking about.<br><br>Anyway, I had begun working on this before my hard drive was destroyed. What I had was the Winamp logo at the top of the page, centered in a canvas of 275x425, with all the names of the participants around it. I thought it would be cool to personalize it a bit, and used my Wacom tablet to write everyones names. Well, with my hard drive destroyed, the drivers for the tablet were destroyed. And since I'm an idiot and threw the recovery CDs away, I can't use it unless I find a place to retreive the drivers.<br><br>Well, what do you guys think about this? I know that's not what is important, but I think it would be a nice addition or feature. If anyone would like to attempt to redesign this, please feel free to and send your ideas to the same email address. If not, I'll whip something up quick when the final release nears closer. :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JFASI</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th March 2006 16:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">By the eleventh hour I meant the last minute.

So far, I've received two remixes from one artist.<br><br>For me, I've got one that's starting to look pretty good. I'm not too sure what more to do with it, so I'm taking the day off from it and let it sink in. I'll go back to it tomorrow and see what else I can spruce up a bit. I have three other presets to choose from to remix, but as of yet nothing has come to me.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th March 2006 11:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Mine are done I just need to remember to send them when I'm at home</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">eheiney</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">31st March 2006 04:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Mentioned on the second page, this was what I had in mind.<br><br>I had thought about writing everyone's name underneath just to spice it up a bit.
