      <p class="post-content"><strong>Radians to Degrees</strong><br />
      Avs sin() and cos() function are working with radians. However, I want it to work with degrees. For example: cos(60) should result in 0.5 instead of -0.95241.... . The problem is, I don't know where the radians come in. Is it the 60? or is it the result which is Radian? The general way to convert radian to degree is to multiply the radian with (180/$pi). This results in knowing that it is not the result that should just be multiplied, for the number get's quite big then, instead of a value between -1 and 1. Performing it this way "cos(60*(180/$pi))" aint working as well. I'm sure most of the code people around here know how it works, though I can't find it out.<br />
      <br />
      Hope someone can help me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The preset I was working on (a trig demo to the newbies). Here you can see very well where the problem lies. The variable a is the corner (dunno if that's correct english). It's in the most top control superscope.<br />
      <br />
      Also I still have to write the comment, but I'll do that as soon as I got this working :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to convert you gotta learn how to cancel. So you have your angle of 60 degrees. In order to convert you have to cancel out the degrees. So set it up like this since pi = 180 degrees...<br />
      <br />
      (60 degrees) * (pi/180 degrees)<br />
      <br />
      Now you can cancel the degrees and multiply giving you...<br />
      <br />
      (60pi)/180<br />
      <br />
      cancel 60 from the top and bottom and you get...<br />
      <br />
      pi/3<br />
      <br />
      There you go.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Or you could just work in radians. Nobody uses degrees past trig, and by the time you're in trig you should already be used to using radians...It's also a whole lot faster to work in radians cos you don't waste code converting....</p>

      360 degrees is a leftover from the Sumerians if I'm not mistaken. They had a radix-60 or radix-24 counting system (much more divisors than our 10), and left their mark on time-telling and geometry (24 hours, 60 minutes, 360 degrees, ...).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Degrees came about after a year was divided into 4 cycling seasons and thus into 360 days. This wasnt the sumerians idea tho, it was well before. I think it was eastern. But the sumerians used this idea to create their entire maths system..<br />

      <br />
      And in case you were wondering why UIUC85 was explaining it in such a 'weird' way, it's in fact the best way.<br />
      Units don't get enough emphasis in mathematics, but they're quite important in science. Plus they can help you remember certain formulas (just check if the units match up).<br />
      <br />
      E.g.<br />
      <br />
      Force = mass * acceleration<br />
      [1 newton] = [1 kg] * [1 m/(s^2)]</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yep - I use units all the time. Especially since the TI-89 has them built in. I always use units when I'm working physics problems - that way if I mess up I know I did because the units don't come out right.</p>
