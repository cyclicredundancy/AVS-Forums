My AVS is working excellent when i play a file from my hard drive, but if i choose a cd the AVS runs but it acts like no music is playing, please someone help?! i dont want to go to jail for avs-slaughter!"<br>I took a few days this weekend to do some partying, and boy, was my inbox full! And the topic was closed. But my issue is not resolved.<br>I installed 2.91 and ticked the digital audio box..... Good news and bad news.<br>The AVS works now but the music is all skippy and choppy. GAAAAHHHH!<br>(and before any wise-guys try slapping me with the stupid stick, no the cd's aren't scratched) lol So what do I do now?<br>btw this is about the funniest forum I have seen in quite a while. No please don't change a thing on my account.... I love to see you guys chopping each other down all the time, one time I even spewed coffee it was so funny!<br>And also a belated thank you to all of you who offered advice and/or opinions.

This has been told a thousand times, but: AVS IS SLOW.<br>Audio CD Extraction<br>Enable CD Audio Extraction<br>is this enabled? I found out that diabling this reduces the jerks a bit. I dont know much about winamp, but I think the cd-audio is ripped to mp3 and then played.<br><br>And you are talking about FUNNY FORUMS, then you tell me, what else can we do? No AVS updates, no bug fixes, no new add-ons, nothing. Most of the AVS related questions have already been answered.<br>I fyou really want to have your problem solved, then bitch about it to NULLSOFT. I dont think this has got much to do with AVS, the jerks and skips.<br>btw. If this is causing so much trouble to you, then why dont you just rip it off to mp3 and use the songs :igor:.

To change this, open up your 'Volume Controls' (Otherwise known as mixer) and select 'Properties' from the Options menu. Now select the 'Recording' option, and make sure all the boxes below it are checked (enabled). Click OK, and you will see the recording levels of various inputs. To sample data from an Audio CD, check the box marked 'Select' under the CD Audio section.

Thats a lot of info in a few paragraphs... and so to reply not necessarily in order of import: my comp is old and slow and an off brand composed of peices and parts limping along on it's last leg. I hate it implicitly, but it is the only one i have.... and it has always handled winamp fine before. and if i disable audio extraction, i get no response on avs. (see 1st post) I tried the thread priority thing... no change. :( And where is the windowed performance thing? And sorry, the thread was closed when i got back to it. ^_~ The volume control didnt work either. I played a cd while trying to figure the thing out, had a brain fart, closed avs while the cd was playing (and skipping) and as soon as i closed avs, it quit skipping, i turned it back on... it skipped... (banging and crashing and the sound of plastic being busted can be heard in the background barely audible behind the roar of curses) hee hee jk Oh yeah one last thing. (sorry) the reason i burn my mp3's to cd is the lack of hard drive space (it just a wittle one- 10 gig)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th June 2003 08:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">thread priority is on the same page as windowed performance (options&gt;windowed)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">javaa</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th June 2003 02:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">well i couldn't find the windowed performance thing, i looked through each and every category in the options menu and no luck.
