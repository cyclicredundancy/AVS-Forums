In your case it comes down to some dodgy piece of Delphi, which wasn't made with any serious use in mind. Throw those things out, and do some direct memory work.

<code><br>bool compareRecords(Record a, Record b)<br>{<br>  if (a.a1 &gt; b.a1) return true;<br>  if (a.a1 &lt; b.a1) return false;<br>  if (a.a2 &gt; b.a2) return true;<br>  if (a.a2 &lt; b.a2) return false;<br>  if (a.a3 &gt; b.a3) return true;<br>  if (a.a3 &lt; b.a3) return false;<br>  ...<br>  return true;<br>}<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Which is then used in a quicksort or whatever sort method... to determine the ordering. Hope it helps...

      <p class="post-content">The Algorithm itself is not the deal.<br>
      <br>
      The thing is that I'm (again) forced to work around some insufficient comßponents. While sorting, the Listview is set into Update state, so the interface wont so any shit while sorting. Unfortunately, this is also disabling direct control ov the items to sort. The compoinent will not return the <b>actual</b> postion of selected items but the <b>inital</b> instead. So any attempt to implenment a standard sorting algorithm fails miserably because you can never check selected items for their correct position. I have to implement a backward counting variable to compensate the offset.<br>
      <br>
      I'm currently busy with planning a big party here, so i've been lazy concerning the sorting problem. But I'll care about this soon.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The new preview is hot, the interface seems nicer, it work and I haven't encountered any bugs, but then again I haven't gone hunting for them.<br>
      <br>
      I just have 3 ideas for Hotlist:<br>
      <br>
      1. Having the ability to set the "Windowed performance" of AVS (the CPU cap for AVS). When not VJ'ing, and just working with hotlist and other apps, it can be helpfull to reduce the CPU-usage.<br>
      <br>
      2. It would be nice to be able to set the Hotlist window size. If not by the windows default resizeing, then by setting the size in the settings menu.<br>
      <br>
      3. Currently it seems that when changeing the size of the screenshots, with the "Fix sliders to current Aspect" checked, the aspect ratio is determined everytime you move the sliders. It would be better to store that ratio in a floating point value, when the checkbox becomes checked, that way the aspect ratio won't be altered when moving the slider very low, and then high again (I know it's not that important).<br>
      <br>
      Anyway I updated and attached the danish translation. Oh and I'd love to see that standalone AVS thing you mentioned, it would open new possibilities for AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Release Candidate 1</strong><br>
      Took me a while, now its done.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the first Release Candidate:<br>
      <a href="http://www.psytrancecamp.de/Hotlist/Files/Hotlist_2.3_RC1.rar" target="_blank">http://www.psytrancecamp.de/Hotlist/...st_2.3_RC1.rar</a><br>
      <br>
      I hope i got all bugs out, if so, i'll pack this into an installer.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately there've been too much trouble with both the position bar and the second small-images view. Those would just not behave the way I wanted.<br>
      <br>
      I'll keep it in mind for upcoming verions, but right now I just want to get it done.<br>
      <br>
      There've been some tiny additions to the language packs.<br>
      <br>
      Please report me any anomalies you might encounter.<br>
      <br>
      Have fun!</p>

      <p class="post-content">So far I've noticed one bug:<br>
      When changing lock mode in the big pics view, the pics are huddled up at the top of the window and on top of each other.<br>
      <br>
      I'll be looking further into it, gotta go back to school now.<br>

      <p class="post-content">You're right.<br>
      Just checked here on a pretty slow and utdated machine.<br>
      Have not recognized this as an annoying thing because its only temporarily and happens in a split second on my PC (3200+). I'll check ways to avoid this.</p>

      <p class="post-content">good rc1:). besides the problem mentioned by grandchild i didnt notice anything wrong with it.<br>
      <br>
      I gues that by position bar you mean the windowed performance slider?<br>
      <br>
      btw i have thought of another feature. i think its the first one that actualy cant be pulled off:). its a save button that would save the preset to its original path. right now its kinda hard to do a quick edit of the preset since you cant always remember where it is:/. But as i said i dont think this is posible.<br>
      <br>
      I gues the thing to focus on for the next version is winamples avs. that would pwn:)<br>
      <br>
      Thank you again for working on this some more 2.3 is great:).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, yeah editing and saving back is tricky now.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe I'll find a way around, I've some Ideas but nothing that can be done quickly.<br>
      <br>
      Anyways:<br>

      <br>
      Fixed that uggly bug when lockmode is set or disabled.<br>
      <br>
      I'm waiting for the final language packs now and will take care about the installer in meantime.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another option idea:)<br>
      <br>
      Add a random wipe and random push transition option. youd have to code these yourself but i gues it wouldnt be too hard.<br>
      <br>
      some presets work realy well with these two even if you blend them with themselfs. it would be extra nice if they wiped/pushed from diferent sides each time you switch:).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Take your time, I'm currently loaded with tons of stuff to do for university and others, so the installer ready version will have to wait. Also, I want the release to be as complete as possible, not done and out as fast as poss.<br>
      <br>
      Hint in case you fail finding the right symbols: Windows has a tool showing you all charackters of a font, you could use this to copy &amp; paste the missing charackters.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hello<br>
      I've never used your program, and can't get it to work.<br>
      Everything seems to work except fot the pressets i click on,<br>
      i've loaded al the standard presets of winamp into your program. The problem is it doesn't mather on wich preset i click it always load the same preset (and refreshes it if i click another preset). Do I something wrong?<br>
      installed Hotlist 2.2 2.3RC1 2.3RC2 and AVS 2.81b<br>
      (2.2 never had anny communication with AVS including hotkey "forwarding")<br>
      <br>
      Then another thing:<br>
      In your newer version you have "Extended AVS Status" this is verry nice because this way i can see the FPS, but this makes it impossible to use AVS editor, because it is continuesly switching to beat detector. Can you sepperate the bpm and fps display status functions?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks in advance<br>
      <br>
      Btw. i'm from the netherlands and will make you a dutch language pack, if "i" get the program to work.</p>
