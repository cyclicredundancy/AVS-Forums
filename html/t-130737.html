      <br />
      The point is that: even though most of you think internet is something you use for fun, we still are <b>real</b> people behind the monitor writing these replies to <b>real</b> people. Any normal person will get angry if they are flamed at or the see something that makes them mad (i.e. this whole mod war didn't make me happy if that is what you think)<br />

      </blockquote>You got it all wrong. Im not quitting, because atero got banned. What do you think of me for crying out loud...<br />
      <br />
      Im talking about this whole situation here, this isn't exactly good publicity for us, now is it?<br />
      <br />
      If i were an outsider i would might something like this about the avs forums &amp; people: "Just a bunch of wannabe mods, beating a dead horse that hasn't been uptaded in ages to consume time while waiting to be elected as a moderator"<br />
      <br />
      Not very flattering image, is it?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And i will continue living, but im still not happy that we got so much bad publicity towards the avs community. A while ago it seemed like AVS was gaining good reputation &amp; there was plenty of new presets to watch, hell we even made PCFormat! Now we want to kill all that just because some people want to be mods?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I haven't done a formal intro because it didn't really seem like a good idea when there was a storm raging around here. But umm, hi, I'm Gonzotek and I like Winamp. I've been on the Winamp for 5 years now, probably, but the last two have seen me at my most Winamped. You could call me a Winampaholic, but I like to think of myself as imbibed with Winamp.<br />
      ------------<br />
      <br />
      Seriously, I've played and developed with many Nullsoft products<br />
      (NSIS, Shoutcast, Winamp2 and 3, NSV, among other flirtations). I've learned a number of languages along the way, and I'm currently learning C++ and AVSing, while working on improving my PHP skills.<br />
      <br />
      Tuggummi, I hear you. Loud and clear. I've got a personal complex right now about how the members of the forum percieve me. But I want to think that I'll be able to earn everyone's trust and respect. And I think that the AVS community as a whole has a lot more positive going for it right now than negative. I don't think this has tarnished it, at least not in any real serious way.<br />
      <br />
      As for rocker, he hasn't been on the boards, so far as I can tell. Maybe he's got some real life issue..dunno. I'll drop an email his way, but if he's offline..&lt;shrug&gt;.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Tugga's I hear what your saying - but the truth is there was no-one listening or judging any reputation in the first place becuase anyone new who enters this forum is warded away with jeering 'annoobiation'.<br />
      <br />
      AVS will get developed as its popularity returns - that can't happen when everyone gets a nice smack across the mouth as soon as they walk through the door. Gonzo seems enthusiastic about the forum and the 'badboy' reputation is only ephemmeral.<br />
