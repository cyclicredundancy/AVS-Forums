      has anyone got any suggestions as to the best way of doing a cloud like effect? (not just smoke, i'm thinking fluffy cotton wool buds floating past (^_^)...)<br />
      <br />
      i guess it's kind of similar to smoke but with many "whorls" grouped in clusters. tbh i never ran to smoke movements at the best of times so this is all past me (^_^).<br />
      <br />
      any help much apprechiated<br />

      My guess is you'd have to use a water bump similar to what I did for my "drunken smokey flares" presets &amp; then use a DM to shape it into a cloud-like shape.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That looks nifty.<br />
      <br />
      Now, to suggest something completely redidulous, you could try and rig up a volumetric cloud with a superscope and you convolution filter and an additive blend. Kinda like this.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      &lt;offtopic&gt; Would it be possible to make it so you could switch boxes in the filter APE with the arrow keys?&lt;/offtopic&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Another way to generate a cloud like texture is to use the water in combination with the scatter (maybe 50/50 blend it) and a gray unique tone set to 50/50 blend. You can then use moving particles or scopes to feed the effects in combination with any moving DM/DS/DDM. The result is varying... I've done a couple of similar things in my first and seventh pack.</p>

      <p class="post-content">jaheckelsafar: first re:off topic: yes i could do that thing with arrows. i'll do it over my christmas vac, though you should be able to use tab at the moment which is almost as good isn't it??<br />
      <br />
      your particle approach rocks. i never though of that. all i've got to do is think up the density equations for a sky full of clouds and we're sorted.<br />
      <br />
      jheriko: your water/scatter combo gives a pretty nifty texture on the small scale but i think it was the larger structure (e.g. scopes and d.m.s) which is the principal problem for realistic looking clouds.<br />
      <br />
      oh and well done on J7 btw just been through it and it's all pretty damn nifty. i'm well chuffed with the all kerazey things my convolution is up to nowadays (^_^)<br />

      <br />
      It's kind of logical that convolution is so common: it replaces tons of effects in AVS. For example, any "blur + brightness" combo can be reduced to a convolution instance. I've been using my own APE for volumetric effects though, which you will be able to see in Whacko AVS VI.</p>

      <br />
      The particle effect looks cool, I had made something similar before but gave up on it because there is no really good way to make particles smaller in the distance than in the foreground... not that it matters for these clouds. I completely forgot about that way of doing it.<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD - what sort of volumetric effects? Volumetric fog? Volumetric lighting? I don't know of any volumetric effects which don't rely on a 3D environment. Could you fill me in on what exactly quantifies a volumetric effect... I find it infuriating when I don't actually know what people are talking about.</p>

      Think about it...I joined in November of 2001, and I haven't released a pack yet. Plus the fact that I became interested in AVS quite some time before joining the forums.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ever thought of trying to make a plasma fractal effect (e.g. what Adobe calls 'merge clouds')? I've thought about it for a long time, but I can't figure out how to do it in SSC.

      <p class="post-content">re: atero<br />
      <br />
      i think camillo is working on that plasma fractal. i e-mailed him a description of the algorithm a bit ago. as for the recursively drawing something problem, you would draw a complete frame on init then on every normal frame you would either just colour cycle a la fractint, or you would zoom in using "plasma" bilinear filtering, e.g. biliniear filtering with a random error term (which would also have to be scaled so it was biggest when the "new" pixel was exactly between the two "old" ones).<br />
      <br />
      re: jaheckelsafar<br />
      <br />
      i should have done that stuff to convolution by now you're right, but i've been away from my pc for a while and now i've switched into holiday chronic laziness mode.<br />
      <br />
      as for the high numbers, it will clip if the absolute sum of either the positive or negative values is greater than 256, it was just a sacrifice i had to make to get optimised code. if you don't like it buy me a p4 or better still an athlon 64, and i'll recode it using sse2 (^_^)</p>
