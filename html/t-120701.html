Atero is telling you that what you have done has been done by many other people already. By only using the default features in AVS there are not many possibilities, which are really dull after seeing them 100 times before. What you need to do is try to change as much as you can and the best way to do this is to learn how to code DMs and SSCs. There are many posts in the forums that will help you with this and even Atero has a very helpful AVS primer (see his signature). I hope this helps. And don't let Atero piss you off too much. He can be very helpful when you don't retaliate to his criticism.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">KiD cHaMeLeOn</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 21:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ummm..<br>Atero when you say fuck you both ie.me?<br>i dont understand i take your critsisum..<br>and MinuS and i both have MSN i just told him to come over cause it was being screwy<br>that's all i have to say<br><br><br><br>Too many god damn critics!!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">VisualAgnosia</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 21:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">the 11th is opposite day 2 day<br><br>hate=love<br>bad=good</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Clinical</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 22:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Kid: Atero (and the rest of us, I'm sure) got pissed off at you and Minus because you're using this board like it's a messaging program. It's not. You two obviously live near each other, so if you want to talk, try the phone. And get used to critics, they're everywhere.<br><br>Raz: As far as I can tell, Atero is just an ass sometimes (no offense :p ). I suggest you learn to tolerate it, for two reasons: 1)the world is full of asses, it's best you learn to take what they say with a grain of salt 2)Atero has some damn good advice sometimes, ya know... he DOES know his way around AVS.<br><br>Minus: Your presets are not bad, but they all rely on pre-made stuff too much. Throw some original code in there. It's not as hard as it looks, really. I mean, sure, if you want to do it right, it takes some time, but just messing around works, and it's fun too. :) Just keep plugging away. Taking apart other people's presets and changing the code is an excellent way to figure out what everything does. Try it! As for Atero's whining, it's called "being a sarcastic, cynical 14-year old". There's nothing wrong with his mind, and I'm sure it knows math better than yours does.<br><br>Jaheckelsafar: Incidentally, where ARE you from? I also tend to say "eh" and "meh" a lot... @_@</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th January 2003 23:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I know atero's very helpful and a smart guy, i wasnt even critisising him i was saying he was right, i tend to screw things up somewhere between getting thoughts and putting them into words.<br><br>Atero can be annoying sometimes, ive even said on a recent thread to people to put up with him or leave and hes a helpful guy a lot of the time, something like that<br><br>Im finished telling people to stop arguing on here now, had a bad couple of weeks and was just wondering as to the point on arguing on this and got a bit pissed off about a lot of things then typed a load of crap to things...<br><br>Anyway thats the last im saying on the subject of how annoying Atero is and people arguing over the internet because its pointless, argue all you want, have fun irritating people far far away.<br><br>As for the presets that the thread is supposed to be about lol, looks like my presets about a month ago, not bad. A little too unoriginal, take the advice and take apart other peoples presets and look up Atero's primer, its really good ive used it and it helped me a lot. Keep trying and take note of constructive critisism, if its just "there crap" ignore it but if it actually specifies something wrong with it then take note of it and if you agree, then improve them, you cant just expect everyone to love your presets and not say any bad things about them.<br><br>Anyway ive gone on long enough...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MinuS_PeDaL</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2003 01:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Clinical: I don't have a phone to phone KiD with. :P</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2003 01:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">then use the PM system that comes with the forum. is that REALLY so hard???<br><br>btw, that "i hate you, raz" comment was a JOKE...as in, a response to him bitching about us bitching at each other.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2003 01:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">lol, good point</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th January 2003 01:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Atero, it can be really hard to tell when you're joking.
