      <p class="post-content"><strong>Star Wars automata</strong><br />
      Remember a while back I posted a "Brian's Brain" automata preset? Well this is the second automata I mentioned in that post: Star Wars. This thing took me weeks and weeks to figure out, but I've finally done it. If I were 21, and I didn't vomit at the very thought of alcohol, I'd help myself to a beer right now :D<br />
      <br />
      I'm too damn excited to start working on changing it right now, so here's a "prototype" - just a moving particle + the star wars algorithm.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; Messing around with it, it looks like that's going to be about all I can do with this. Oh well :) &lt;/edit&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very nice Atero. Seemed to create a couple of penises though.:igor: Makes a lot of worms and blobs.<br />
      Is it considered a true automata since it needs a moving particle to keep it changing?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice...i like the way it moves without any DM or movement :) I had no idea you can something like this using a CF and color clips :rolleyes: Good work indeed :)<br />
      <br />
      PS&gt; Try adding more moving particles.It will be MORE dynamic...Also it really needs the clear every frame option from Main at the beggining(the image of the previous preset stayed on my computer).</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeah, i'm gonna fix all that when i release it.<br />
      <br />
      btw for anyone trying to say "make it more alive!" first go bash your head into a brick wall then go look up information on cellular automata, since i've got better things to do than tell you guys why that's just not the way it is...<br />
      <br />
      btw there seems to be a bug having to do with state 2 cells (state 1 being alive, 2 being old, 3 being dying, and 0 being dead). i THINK that's the one that's glitchy, but don't quote me on it. it seems that any dead cell with 2 neighbors that was alive last generation becomes a state 2 cell. very odd...</p>

      <p class="post-content">all you have to do is delete the particle and yes, it is :)<br />
      in fact, you could argue that it is with the particle as well. you'd just have to write a bunch more rules for it that say "the (star wars) rule applies except when the cell is invaded by the space taken by the particle, in which case cells are an obligatory state 1" - then define the space taken by the particle for generation N given a uniform random position defined for every generation where a given sound source reaches a given sound level. however, the edges (for any automata in avs) need further redefenition, because of the way convolution filter works...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Isn't it a rule that automata have to be based purely on a beginning state of rules and conditions with no outside influences(i.e. moving partice)? This is what I've heard that automata are.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Automatas basically is just a rule with a carryout. Outside influences are allowed, but it's no fun that way - Keeping something alive without any outside influences is both challenging, and, if you're the type, fun.<br />
      <br />
      The simplest one known is the 1-d automata (This one being elementary one), with 256 possible rules, and 2 possible states, either alive or dead.<br />

      <br />
      P.S. : Can someone with a lot of time to spare code a few presets in form of SSC+rule? (n=bla in first frame, 0 in 2nd or others to save some power) I think it'd be interesting to see some of the guns over AVS =)</p>

      (Topic change) Also, I read up on that automata stuff and other things and found that I couldn't figure out how to put f(whatever goes here)=(stuff that goes here) into avs. Probably lack of education, so i'll ask you educated math gods ;) , how do you convert it so that it fits into avs?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using convo, you make a little environment with it (The 3x3 square surrounding the middle for Moore, the 4 pixels touching the middle directly for von Neumann (sp?)). Color clip to adjust for n neighborhood survival and birth according to % of color.<br />
      <br />
      How exactly do you use the color clips? Hopefully your logic is good enough to figure it out. Otherwise don't even think of trying.<br />

      <p class="post-content">First off, it steps through pixel by pixel. This pixel is set to the center pixel. It then alters the color of the other pixels in the "neighborhood" to a mix between their current color and the center pixels color based on the number in their square and the inversed scaling number. I'm not sure exactly, but it would be something like the average color of (R,G,B) and ((R + &lt;number in square&gt; * &lt;R of center square&gt; / &lt;scaling number) / 2,(G + &lt;number in square&gt; * &lt;G of center square&gt; / &lt;scaling number) / 2,(B + &lt;number in square&gt; * &lt;B of center square&gt; / &lt;scaling number) / 2)).</p>

      <p class="post-content">no. the center of the matrix represents the point at hand. you take the color values from the relative pixels and multiply them by the numbers in the matrix and add that all together, then add the bias, then divide by the scaling amount. this final number is assigned to the given pixel. so for the "fastest possible blur":<br />
      0 1 0 bias 0<br />
      1 0 1 scale 4<br />
      0 1 0<br />
      you take the color values from the pixels directly above, below, to the left and to the right of the given pixel, add them up and divide it by 4 and color the given pixel accordingly. this gives you a slightly blurry picture. when the process is repeated several times you get an entropic effect: the colors spread and even out over time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Phaze, I'm not sure how you came up to those conclusions from what I said. "rows" aren't anything in this - the matrix makes up a small "neighborhood" of numbers used to represent the pixels surrounding the point being considered. If you know some C++ or similar language, PM me and I will send you something that may help explain it better.<br />
      <br />
      Back on topic, Atero, have you tried making any automata based on larger neighborhoods? I've seen a couple of these online, and they create some interesting effects.</p>
