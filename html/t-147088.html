Of course those are most customizable, but you can some times get the same effect when using some of those "noobish" or as i call them old school effects.<br><br>The only reason i called you a newb (i didn't know that you worked with avs for 3 years now) is that you (among other people) have become too dependent on superscopes and dynamic movements. Most of the forum entries here are based on the science of avs, just to become more technically pleasing, when the art of avs is lost.<br><br>So as you have been working with avs for three years, you should well know how to make presets without the need for most of those dynamic trans.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">28th August 2003 20:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I do, but static presets have been around for so long, almost everything has been done before. This makes it extremely difficult to come up with something that's never been seen before.<br><br>That's what I meant with not being able to live without dynamics. I mean, look at today's presets and at the oldschool presets. the older ones are very repetative compared to what we're doing today. Especially the use of timers gives you so much more freedom.<br><br>And yeah, we still have the DDM... And Horse-Fly, you know what? you're right. I haven't been using that one almost ever since the DM, although I do use other effects, but I have a *LOT* of unpublished work that uses them, but that isn't worth publishing. But thing is, that i'm currently working on finding out how to handle complexer 3D SSC's myself.. Yeah, I know, d/l 3 random packs and i should be able to know everything I need to know, but the sport is to find things out myself in advanve instead of ripping someone elses code apart afterward... That's what keeps me AVS'sing, breaking my brain over having the code written out in my mind... hmmmm...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">nixa</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2003 16:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I returned from my vacation just in time for a contest :)<br>And I remember a time when there was no warp or bylinear filtering but there were still cool presets.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th August 2003 23:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I actually managed to make a couple of decent presets with no DMs and SSCs...
