In AVS this just means adding a render item which will plot a spectrum.<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by toqer</i><br><b>My main use for it would be to open "line in" on winamp, then cause feedback on my mic.

If so thats an incredibly convoluted way of doing so, just fiddle with the gain settings, read the mic manual or something. If you are talking about removing the voices from songs then you need to bandpass filter the music (which doesnt have anything to do with the mic)<br><br>If you just want to display a spectrum make a new avs and add a render/simple. The far left is DC (you can think of it as 0Hz) and the far right is the nyquist frequency (the sample rate of the input divided by 2)<br><br>I cant help you any further without you explaining what you want more eloquently.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">toqer</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">22nd May 2006 20:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Well I already did it this saturday, just without AVS though :( It worked perfectly! I had my friend zugzug (creative labs engineer) help me out by walking around the room with the mics.<br><br>I found <a href="http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html" target="_blank">this</a> nice little ocilloscope package.<br><br><a href="http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/speclab1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/speclab1.jpg</a><br><br>Basically what we did was, turn the mics up till we created feedback, then spectrum lab would draw a nice line on the waterfall display (sort of like that purple line on the left). I'd mouse over the line on the waterfall display, and it would give me the exact frequency of the feedback.<br><br>After finding the exact frequency, I added a parametric EQ tuned to that frequency on my 1820m's patchmix. Dial the bandwidth down so I wouldn't be notching out too much.<br><br>In all I added about 7 or 8 parametric EQ's to the mic inputs. We can krank up the volume to the max now with just a hint of some light high frequency feedback (like 15000hz range, barely noticable)<br><br>I don't understand why you guys always say "This or that can't be done in AVS".

Also, oscilloscopes and spectrums are very basic stuff in AVS, they are not 'all' it 'does' however. One of the reasons people did not understand your request was that you asked for something so simple that people could not understand where the problem was.<br><br>I also suggest (dont take this as an insult) that you try to improve your language when talking about something technical as using the incorrect word can often hinder the readers ability to understand you.

'reading' the thread. If you read the thread you will notice that UnConeD explains why you cannot identify specific frequencies.<br><br>The fact that you cannot identify frequencies as a value is the reason the labels in the preset are expressed in terms of the sample rate, if you know the sample rate of your input then you can change the labels accordingly... and if you were really smart you would have a variable at the beginning of the preset where you could input the sample rate and it would change the labels for you and tell you the frequency at the cursor.<br><br>P.S.
