      I tried to stay away from avs but i couldn't...<br />
      <br />
      So i decided to make a pack or a minipack of 3D presets, you know grind out the basics and classics so i won't do those again :D<br />
      <br />
      Anyway here is the second preset created for the pack, a (suprise suprise!) tunnel dm :p<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Enjoy, i know i will :)</p>

      <br />
      x=ix<br />
      <br />
      with this code, a DM will take the color of the point at ix and map it onto x. ix is the universal x coordinate of the intersection point. That's all you need to know. Another way of looking at it is that you will wallpaper your surface with the original image and that the x of the original image will be aligned with the x of the surface.</p>

        I'm just wondering, why not ray trace?
      </blockquote>Because i don't know how :) Simple enough? I don't know how to do ray trace, i just learned the basics of 3D rotation (which i don't understand but i know what to use to get the end result)<br />
      <br />
      Basicly, i don't understand a dick what im doing, i just bang my head to the keyboard like the million monkeys until something comes out of it :p<br />
      <br />
      And those posts about ray-tracing, 3D objects, Cameras, etc. They help me none, how the hell i could understand them when i don't even understand the basics of trigo...the fucking hard word for geometric math or something...<br />

      <p class="post-content">With UnConeD's zero g-maze 3, the most confusing part I'm finding in it is how his camera rotation works, I have been able to isolate and control most of his other variables, but I can't get his stupid camera rotation to work! It was really fun ripping apart WolfenAVStein3d though :-) , but back to Tuggumi's preset, I have to say it runs really good on my computer, I was looking at his coding today and not only does it run faster on my computer then a raytraced DM, but it is also 10x easier to change things in it then a raytraced DM, but I also like all the different shapes of tunnels/planes you can make with yours by changing things in the 3-D to 2-D section.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I read the comment, I wasn't confused by the different phases it used to move, but the way it was coded to smoothly transition from rotation to acclereating to slowing down then reseting. I looked it over the past day, and I spent a while changing variables and messing around with different lines of code, and I'm pretty sure I got it now, the only thing I need to do now is try and make my own from scratch.</p>

      <p class="post-content">fsk: those are just transformations that involve rotations and/or skewing, where the angle or distance depends on the coordinates.<br />
      <br />
      A bend is where you rotate the coordinates in a plane, and the rotation angle is dependant on a coordinate along a vector in that plane.<br />
      E.g. bend an object in the XY plane, where the rotation angle for point (x,y,z) equals the x coordinate.<br />
      <br />
      A twist/torsion is where the rotation angle in a plane is dependant on a coordinate along a vector perpendicular/normal to that plane.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Check the attachment and note the only difference between the two is the plane in which rotation occurs.</p>

      In the Trans / Dynamic Movement you will find in the Frame section these code lines:<br />
      xr=xr+xrs ;<br />
      yr=yr+yrs ;<br />
      zr=zr+zrs ;<br />
      <br />
      Change those code lines to:<br />
      <br />
      xr=0 ;<br />
      yr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
      zr=0 ;<br />
      <br />
      This will stop the rotation completely, if you want to rotate the tunnel end so it will be horizontally wider just use:<br />
      <br />
      xr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
      yr=pi*0.5 ;<br />
      zr=0 ;<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And no i haven't seen any sonique vis's (well except those i have seen used in avs presets) So i wouldn't know what you are talking about :)<br />
      <br />
      If you want a "true" rabbit hole preset, check out El-vis's Cyberpunx Pack you can find on the classic.winamp.com site (just search with the word el-vis)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Miketrevis, just change the 0.05 to a minus one too :)<br />
      <br />
      i.e. slide=slide-speed-boost-0.05 ;<br />
      <br />
      Then it will be the perfect opposite of the original.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Then you will have to seek out something else. tunnels that bend are pretty hard to make with a dynamic movement... atleast i don't know how. And there is nothing you can do with this preset that could make it like molehole.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I wonder if anyone has made a bending tunnel dynamic movement, closest I can think of is UnConeD's Speeder 3K, it doesn't really bend, and it'snot really a tunnel though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol<br />

      and i'm fairly sure that a bending tunnel is impossible in dm, or at least extremely hard and would require some major code hacks.</p>
