But frame rates always suck because of the bottlenecks that avs gets when rendering due to the use of just the cpu. Ive found something that helps frame rates a bit, RAMDISK!<br><br>I just started to toy with the ramdisk driver for win2k after reading up on the Mach3.8 computer.(side note- that thing is bitchin)<br><br>anyway, they implement a pci card-ramdisk and I started looking at prices for these devices and they are quite expensive, then I noticed a google hit on win2k ramdisk driver, clicked it and found out I can make a ghetto ramdisk out of my system memory!<br>Unfortunatly for me, I bought 1.5 gigs of corsair xms a year ago and to date, windows has never used more than 50% of it, even after I disable page file etc.. But this obscure Ramdisk was like something from heaven, its rediculous how well it works. And not really knowing how to bench mark it I simply started putting media files on it and testing the seek times etc..As a bi-product I discoverd AVS frame rates almost doubled for most presets. Im using a P4C-800 duluxe mobo, with a p4 2.8 and 1.5 gigs of ram, I edited the boot.ini for windows to exclude 512 megs of ram for my ramdisk. If your inclined to try it and know how to get around windows then I say go for it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2004 16:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">How big (%) is this boost?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2004 16:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Um how exactly would a software ramdisk help AVS performance, which is already 100% run in system memory?<br><br>RAM disks only affect programs with lots of disk operations and swapping.

Despite my best efforts winamp will not load more than 10 megs at a time, and just keep reading from the hard drive. :P Or my windows install has a cronic problem of never running a whole anything in ram. It does increase responsiveness. I can tell just by the seek times when fast forwarding through a 120 meg mp3. Before i had to wait up to 5 seconds before the sound would kick back in, now its instantanious. Same thing with video, more dramitic with video even. The only thing that doesnt get accelerated so far is the sample windows media HD trailers. They still lag like hell, i though it was that my Drive couldnt read fast enough but I guess not, its just poor encoding or crappy codec i guess.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">petey1434</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th July 2004 17:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>ps</strong><br>and I take offense to the "poorly configured memory", My mem is Corsair Xms at 400 mhz, on what was previously the highest rated motherboard. Its not the memory, Its just that running the media as well as the program all in ram cuts out the hard drive completly. It does help, especially with large mp3s or video files. The hard drive read time lags the vis noticably compared to having the file on the ram disk, at least at reasonable resolutions. Its also nice to hav a library of media files in ramdisk, because you can fast forward or rewind or change files instantly. Which cuts down on lag cause by a hard drive seeking out the next file during a song change. And the changing of Presets is also much faster, because there is no load time from the hard drive.

For some reason your disk IO was messed up. You could have at least mentioned this in your original post. When I play huge MP3 files, AVS works just as well.<br><br>Oh and as far as 'offending' you: I made an objective comment about your configuration, I did not insult your mom.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">petey1434</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th July 2004 16:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>:)</strong><br>Yea, its a 4 month old windows install thats really cluttered from admin files for cs etc...And theres probably spy ware all over making my drive churn. On another note I would say this is psychoacoustical, but It feels like the sound is "punchy-er" compared to having it on the hard drive. Or my ears were in a different state of hearing or somthing. Am using Sennheiser HD-590's with a nice headroom phone amp! :D Has anyone used those m-audio audiophile sound cards? Or does anyone know about getting the most out of "consumer" quality stuff. If I can OC my vid card, I should dam well be able to do something to my sound card! lol:D</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
