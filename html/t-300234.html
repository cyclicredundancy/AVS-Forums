      Was there ever a J10 pack? I remember doing a couple of remixes for it, but never saw it published :confused:<br />

      Anyone know what happened to it?</p>

      My files say 20th of January 2005 @ 13:15:37 is the creation date, which probably is just the date I re-copied them to my new harddrive :igor: So the actual date is even longer.<br />
      <br />
      Weird, the modifying date is 30th of march 2004 @ 21:28:36 :igor:</p>

      I have everything bar the intro, which may or may not exist I forget. J is just totally disinterested in AVS now (like most of us) so I wouldnt expect a release to happen. I would post it myself but I dont really want to do it without his permission. Maybe I'll ask him about it and see if he's happy for it to go up here in its unfinished form.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i'd say it's pretty outdated and not his best pack. having seen what jheriko is capable of, j10 (as i've seen it) could "damage" his reputation. that leaves the options of a remake (or why not leave out j10 and do j11), which is more unlikely. some of the remixes were good, set them free!</p>

      </blockquote>if the installer was made with pimpbot 3.2 (or higher), it should work on vista. i will look into this once i get home.<br />
      <br />
      in the meantime there's a workaround you can try (it works with all pimpbot installers): run the installer from commandline (or try <a href="http://rwparam.whyeye.org" target="_blank">runwithparameters</a>) with the /unzip parameter (e.g. "J10.exe /unzip") and it will just extract the contained files to the current directory.

      <p class="post-content">all you vista pros out there, you should know by now that in many cases you need elevated rights to perform certain actions. a right-click on the installer allows you to run the installer with admin-rights, that way there won't be any errors!<br />
