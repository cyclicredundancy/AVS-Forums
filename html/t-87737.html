The if statement that they have so far i've only been able to get to work for 0 or non-0... like it says it does..:(<br><br><br>oh and if your interested here's the preset i want to add it to, it's kinda cool in my opnion.<br><br><br>(edit)<br><br>ooo i think i figured it out!<br>d=i*0.98*max(min(getspec(0,1,0),.2),.05)*5;<br>vwahahaha I'm so smart :p<br>:) :)<br>no thanks to all you suckers!

I (as you may have noticed) was signed in at the time you made your post. I immediately looked at it-and I would have gladly written a reply responding to your question-but I didn't *know* the answer for sure.<br><br>The Winamp AVS forum is meant to be more like a bunch of helpful (but sometimes busy) people who enjoy answering other people's questions in their spare time. But keep in mind that the forums aren't like a 24-hour technical support line - because what makes the forums so great is that the the everything the members do is on their own free time; so whenever the members are booked up either because of school, a job, or whatever, it may seem to take a long time before your question gets answered.<br><br>And considering that many members like me might not know the answer, I'd say getting an answer within a day is a very quick response.<br><br>Take for example, my post called "Sneak peek at AVS pack!!!!" Here's a hyperlink-but I'm not sure it will work...<br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=87661" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....threadid=87661</a><br>There's a lot of presets in my preview to my AVS pack, so I anticipate that it will take a while before I get a reply back-because there's so many presets to look through &amp; analyze completely.<br><br><br><br>But since you were just kidding, I was just answering your question 'what gives' that you didn't get an immediate reply.<br><br>So I guess it's all in good fun :)<br><br>--C.
