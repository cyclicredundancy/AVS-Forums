      <p class="post-content">It's called a FAQ you dumbass. You got two extremely clear signals: The sticky thread, 'Forum rules/How to find the answers' and the message above your Create New Thread page that said something along the lines of 'Search the forums before posting.' Never go straight out and ask people these kinds of questions if you're new to a forum, as you are. Always assume your question has been asked before, and has been answered in some way before, because if you don't and you do something stupid like this the only thing it gets you is the regulars pissed off at you, and that's not a good thing to do for a first impression. Now go read the fucking FAQ thread before I ban you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fair enough, but if we are all rude and aggressive towards newcomers then the community will die.<br />
      <br />
      What we need is some kind of string analyser that will tell you if your question has been asked before, when you post a new thread, and then stop it from being posted if it has.</p>

      <p class="post-content">That would be<br />
      1. hard to make<br />
      2. impose itself on the quasi-free speech we enjoy here at the winamp forums<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm against saying 'fuck you dumbass', but I wouldn't post anything more than "Read the FAQ, question 8". He can find the link himself.<br />
      <br />
      In any case, I doubt there's much to do against this. As atero said, there are EXTREMELY clear signals to indicate existing documents. How can you miss the friggin' bold, red text when posting a new topic?<br />
      <br />
      It's a common phenomenon with newbies:<br />
      1) They have a problem and see a forum for questions.<br />
      2) They register and post their question.<br />
      3) They realise it will take a while to get a reply, so they start to look for other solutions.<br />
      4) They either find the solution themselves or find a reference document that explains it.<br />
      5) The newbie never reads the answers to his original question.<br />
      <br />
      In fact, we can easily see if #5 is true.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I think we just need a simple solution, like this:<br />
      <br />
      1) User registers<br />
      2) User clicks "Post new thread"<br />
      3) if (User-&gt;PostCount &lt; 5) { User gets big, red text saying "Read This!", followed by an explanation (in black ;)) telling them to search for existing threads before asking. Not doing so will get people mad at them. }<br />
      <br />
      Giving links to the forum guidelines won't help, because they're too long. It's a big document which will scare 99% of all newcomers away.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I see...I don't agree though. It's just cleaning up the forum for the regulars here, and answering most of the questions newbies might have here.<br />
      <br />
      Notice how the fucker hasn't come back. This has become a completely pointless thread, and the subject has changed to 'how can we stop these idiots from cluttering up the forum.' Ya think this deserves to stay up? Neither do I.</p>
