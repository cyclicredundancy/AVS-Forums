I'd appreciate any comments, and if you have time I encourage you to write a preset by preset review (ONLY if it is convenient for YOU).<br><br>Also, I am assuming most of you have all of UnConeD's packs installed, so I have not included the APEs or images of his that I use. I am sorry if this causes a problem, but probably for most of you it would take longer to pick and choose what parts of the zip file to unzip. And let me add, UnConeD's APEs are excellent.<br><br>I suggest you view the preset in order, from beginning to end.<br><br>Well, :up: or :down: ?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2003 01:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Very nice, some are much better than others but overall, very good pack, some very original ideas and themes.<br><br>00 as seen on tv - overall good effect. The flashing with the numbers is very nice, except sometimes it flashes but dosent change, im not overly joyed in seeing grainy presets but this is nice. Also you shouldve set the "channel" numbers text to random ordering ;)<br>01 following a comet - looks nice but its rather empty and simplistic and the DM gives me a headache. Needs something else.<br>02 cpu - When i first looked at this i thought, ugh, chaotic. But after about 10 seconds it started to look like a really nice complicated preset, good work.<br>03 cartoonists dream - meh, simple superscope and some colours, dosent look bad but its been done too many times<br>04 neon combustion - flashy, but smooth, i kinda like it but im not sure why, This looks like a better version of 01 but its a little too bright at points, otherwise nice.<br>05 into the eye - good overall effect, i suppose. Just that those lines going to the middle is all it seems to do.<br>06 blaze - very nice, i like that fire. Maybe something else should be happening but otherwise great.<br>07 vivid flowers - heh, this one made me laugh, very original idea, very well implemented, good job.<br>08 juggling colours - interferences, meh. The superscope is pretty good but thats where it ends.<br>09 radioactive puddle - looks good but there culd be a little more colour change and its not exactly the most original idea ever, too much green but otherwise nice effect.<br>10 iced blaze - i prefer the original, this is kind of irritating and the fireworks make it look a bit crappy, not bad though.<br>11 blind speed - too chaotic and colour-o-matic for my liking, not bad effect but youve used both these effects in different presets<br>12 claustrophobia - love the colours and the whole basic thing, just could use some 3d rotation, otherwise, great work.<br>13 approaching the big bang - nice effect i guess, but its just plain boring, it barely does anything.<br>14 lavapool - love the way it looks and the whole metablobs thing, good preset but not a great ammount of work on your part, good preset anyway.<br>15 electric whirlpool - dosent do much but looks great with soft music, not really a preset, more of a background.<br>16 ocean descent - is it just my pc or is this just dark bubbles floating about.<br>17 infared fog - very nice, love the effect you get with the DM, the scopes a little "simple" but still looks great.<br>18 science - excellent work here, very original. I love that lightning effect and the way the purple makes up the stormy effect, great work.<br>19 blueprint - wow, frikkin amazing, looks great. This looks like something UnConeD did or would do anyway, 5 star preset there, great job.<br>20 Thats not art - a tad on the basic, additive, moving partice, nOOb preset side, its an ok effect i suppose but a big quality drop from the preceding preset.<br>21 crystal ball - very nice original idea, very well implemented, i could watch this for a long time, it looks very ssmooth and liquidlike and not always like a crystal ball but anyway, good preset.<br>22 Piece of the matrix, nice job. Not very original but hey, i cant critisize you for that ive done something similar with the ones and zeros dropping. That plane in the middle looks great. Nice work.<br>23 football weather - amazing, another 5 star preset here. Takes a while to get started but i was staring in awe once it got going, it looks so realistic. Great.<br>24 Standing on the shore - Nice work but its sort of, in the makings of a 5 star preset. It looks great but at points but you need to work on it so that it looks like it all the time.<br>25 credits - haha, original idea. I was going to do this, bastard :p lol, ah well, good idea, well implemented.<br><br>Overall id say youve got a 4.3 star pack here, like i said, some are better than others and some are just plain amazing. Keep up the good work, hope to see some more soon :up:<br><br>im gonna go have a nice long rest now</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2003 02:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">00 - Don't like the flashing. Otherwise, good preset.<br>01 - There is a problem with the movements at the top and bottom of screen(glitchy shapes sometimes). The shaking is a little annoying, but alright<br>02 - Good matrix preset. I would let the camera move in/out a bit more, but very nice overall.<br>03 - Definitely seen this before. Standard Noob look, but is actually, codewise, better.<br>04 - Brightness taken too far - looks great without it. Try using a DM instead of constant zooming movement.<br>05 - Add some more lightning bolts and colors. Take out the flash.<br>06 - Needs a good background. The effect list just makes it confusing. A simple green, grainy background could be nice.<br>07 - Make the sun move some and add sky/ground textures. Could be a nice cartoony preset with textures.<br>08 - Uses glitches in it(the color rectangles). Don't really like it.<br>09 - Good fluid movment. Multiple colors at once would make it even better.<br>10 - Don't like the lines, or the fyrewurx. Definitely faster than the fire preset though.<br>11 - Don't like the thick render mode. Turn the SSC shaking some too.<br>12 - Add something else(like hovercraft or something). Kinda boring right now.<br>13 - Needs a background. Make the on beat changes smoother.<br>14 - Use something besides the TV ape to give it a texture.<br>15 - Let the mass of lines move around some. Could lend to a nice effect if more than one mass was used.<br>16 - My screen stays almost totally black for this one. All i see are a couple of vibrating circles.<br>17 - Kind of boring ossciliscope. Make it do something.<br>18 - Add a movement that will do a bit more. Good SSC, just make it a bit more noticable.<br>19 - Lovely preset. My favorite so far. The waving background is really neccessary. This shows some talent.<br>20 - Seen similar before. Not very interesting.<br>21 - Too uneventful. Very repetitive. Could use a better, more dynamic movement.<br>22 - Make the weird sheet move smoothly. What is it supposed to be, anyways?<br>23 - I'm guessing you are trying to make it look like it's raining and there is lighting... at least everywhere outside the little bubble. Try making it look like the person is lost - have him turn around and run in circles. Try putting a team logo on the 50(also, add yard markers).<br>24 - What is wth the gradient going across the top of my screen?. Waves aren't very realistic, but the beach is fairly realistic. Make the surf come in and out.<br>25 - The stars are scaring me. Add some color to it.<br><br>Overall - 4.25. Good pack. Some noob presets in the middle, but there are some very original ones. #19 is by far my favorite. Can't wait to see more from you.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2003 02:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Wow, this pack really blew my mind, considering it's from a relatively new AVSer ;) Technically excellent, and visually quite good in spots. However, you need to work on patching up your presets so they aren't uberchaotic and/or glitchous.<br>Blueprint and Vivid Flowers were two of the best superscope presets I've seen - I wouldn't change a thing about them except for fixing prints in Blueprint that are too large, and making the flowers in Vivid Flowers always touch the stems.<br>I give it 4.5 stars. Good work! :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2003 03:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice. :up:<br><br>Definately some class presets in there.

I probably shouldn't have made them that way, but I suppose it's too late to fix that now. But anyway try it with loud music and see if there's a difference.<br><br>In addition, on Lavapool, I meant to leave Clear Every Frame off, but right now it's on. You might want to try turning it off, altough I don't think it will make a big difference, just some extra red in the blobs.<br><br>Also, I agree, Blueprint did come out very nice. I intend to do more with that superscope setup, including bring it into full 3D. That preset is probably my favorite of the pack, although Football Weather definitely comes in at a close second.<br><br>Anyway, I'm glad you all enjoyed the pack, although I still have a lot of work to do before I'm up there with the "legends" of AVS (specifically, I need to learn 3D math).

Your mix really does remind me of Blade Runner (my all time favorite sci-fi movie by the way), especially in the way both night and day are represented.<br><br>It seems to me that even if AVS hasn't been updated in ages, there is still a lot of creativity that has yet to be found, which is going to be the focus of my next pack. Instead of producing many boring, seen-it-before presets (Cartoonist's Dream, Blind Speed, etc.), I'm going to concentrate on making imaginative visuals, such as Blueprint, Vivid Flowers, and Football Weather, which were the presets most of you said were the best of the pack. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of my presets are going to be very technical, or contain advanced effects, just that I'm going to use existing techniques in new and interesting ways (Football Weather is a perfect example of this).<br><br>Again, thanks for your comments and encouragement!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd February 2003 22:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah, technical presets/creative ideas always tend to have some awesome results(Very noticibly, Blueprint).
