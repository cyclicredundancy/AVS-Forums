To understand what happens, consider a 2D universe (a flat plane) and how it relates to 3D. Just like you can represent 3D by an infinite amount of 2D 'slices' (planes), you can think of 4D as composed of an infinite amount of 3D 'slices' (spaces).<br>Now, think about how we represent 3D space on a flat plane: we project all the points from an eye onto a plane, commonly by dividing by the 'z' coordinate. So if you wanted to represent a 4D hyperspace in 3D space, you'd need to divide 3 coordinates by a 4th (as you're projecting a 4D hyperspace onto a 3D space). This is what Atero's superscope does. On top of that, it takes the 3D result, and projects it onto 2D like any other 3D superscope.<br><br>Now, you might say "aha! so it's not actual 4D! it's just a 3D shape that moves in a weird way!". Well, so is 3D on a computer: it's a 2D shape that looks like 3D, because our eyes view the world like that too.<br><br>Now specifically about a 4D hypercube:<br><br>A 3D cube has 6 square (2D) faces. A 4D cube has 8 cube 'faces' (3D). If you look at Atero's superscope, you'll notice that it hardly looks cubic: all the angles are distorted. Well, if you look at how you draw a 3D cube on a 2D paper, it'll be distorted too. You're just used to it so much, that it becomes natural.<br><br>Higher-dimensional shapes might sound like an alien concept, but they have many uses in mathematics and science.

The dimension of a shape/space can be seen as the number of linearly independent vectors you can construct in it. For example:<br><br>In a flat plane, you can construct 2 base vectors (e.g. the X and Y axis) that, when added up, can reach the entire plane. It's impossible to find a third vector that can't be broken up as a sum of the earlier two.<br><br>In space, there are 3 such vectors (e.g. X, Y, Z). Now, imagine a hypothetical 4D space, where there are 4 such vectors. In our reality, there is no such thing (or at least not found :)).<br><br>To show this 4D shape, we project it into 3D space, much like we can project a 3D shape onto a 2D plane (e.g. a computer screen). So while it becomes a 3D/2D shape, we actually still have the originating 4D shape in mind.<br><br>A (hyper)cube is very different from a (hyper)torus.

However, when I shift w by 2 (so it's from 1 to 3) to translate it to 3D, I get distortion. Also, after that translation, the shift of sqrt(2) does not work on the 3D/2D translation - I have to shift and scale by 2. But that brings up another mystery: Using those shifts, the sphere the cube is projected into (and thereby the ring that sphere is projected into) fits perfectly into the window. With shifting and scaling by 2 on any 3D superscope, you end up with a ring larger than the window.<br>Any ideas?<br><br><br>ZS, the hypercube is a much different object from the hypertorus. Think of it this way: A two dimensional torus would be an O shape. Stretch that into the third dimension and it becomes a donut, or torus, in prissymathematicianspeak. (Why an I hungry all of a sudden?) You can then stretch that into the fourth dimesion (I don't know how, but I'm working on it); this is the hypertorus. Why did you think my hypercube looked 'toroidal?'<br><br>This is a (rather poor) wireframe torus:<br>tpi=acos(-1)*2;<br>x=sin(i*tpi)*(sin(i*tpi*500)/3+1);<br>y=cos(i*tpi)*(sin(i*tpi*500)/3+1);<br>z=cos(i*tpi*500)/3;<br>UnConeD, do you know the coordinates for a hypertorus?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th May 2002 09:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Well actually there are two things you can mean by a torus.<br><br>Take a grid. Bend it so that two opposite edges are joined, you now have a cylinder-like shape. Bend it again so that the remaining two edges (now circles) are joined: you now have a donut.<br><br>So the main property of a n-torus is that is an n-grid that is connected to itself in every direction. This has a few 'weird' consequences: for example, if you start out with the other pair of edges, you'll get a differently oriented donut, but the topological properties are still the same.<br><br>I've been thinking about a system behind hypertori (like the system to go from dot to line to square to cube to hypercube) and here's what I believe is close to correct:<br><br>- Take a point (0D)<br><br>- Trace a circular path with it, so that the center of the circular path is outside the shape, and a new axis is used. We now have a circle (2D). However a point on the shape itself can always only move on 1 degree of freedom, so the shape's topology can be considered 1D. Note that this is essentially a line with its begin and endpoints connected.<br><br>- Take this circle, and trace a circular path with it, so that the center of the circular path is outside the shape, and a new axis is used. We now have a torus/donut (3D). However a point on the shape itself can always move only on 2 degrees of freedom, so the shape's topology can be considered 2D. Note that this is a 2D grid with both pairs of ends connected to the opposite side.<br><br>- Take this donut, and trace a circular path with it, so that the center of the circular path is outside the shape. We now have a 4-hypertorus (4D). However a point on the shape itself can always move only on 3 degrees of freedom, so the shape's topology can be considered 3D. Note that this is a 3D grid with all pairs of opposite faces connected to the opposite side.<br><br>So for one, you have the topology, and always several geometrical representations that satisfy this topology. Think of generating it by having a hyperdimensional compass (is this the right word? a tool for drawing circles on paper) and dragging the dot, circle and donut through (hyper)space.<br><br>The formulas have a system to them too. You're always shifting the previous shape around on one axis, and then rotating around to get the circular path:<br><br>1:<br>x1 = 0;<br><br>2:<br>x2 = (x1 + R1)*cos(a1);<br>y2 = (x1 + R1)*sin(a1);<br><br>3:<br>x3 = x2;<br>y3 = (y2 + R2)*cos(a2);<br>z3 = (y2 + R2)*sin(a2);<br><br>4:<br>x4 = x3;<br>y4 = y3;<br>z4 = (z3 + R3)*cos(a3);<br>w4 = (z3 + R3)*sin(a3);<br><br>...<br><br>Rx are the radii of the separate stages, ax are a variable ranging from 0...2PI.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2002 07:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Umm...I applied that to AVS, and the system renders a pringle-shape.

Take another cube and move it in a theoretical 4th dimension. Connect the corresponding vertices.<br><br>What we have now, is a 4D-hypercube. To understand what it 'looks' like, look at the following analogies:<br><br>- A 1D line has 2 0D-points<br>- A 2D square has 4 1D-lines<br>- A 3D cube has 6 2D-squares<br>- A 4D hypercube has 8 3D-cubes<br><br>And there you have it. It's not just 2 cubes that you see, it's 8. Of course, because of the 4D-&gt;3D perspective, it'll only look cubic in some positions. But in the original 4D concept, every line is perpendicular to every other line, and they are all of length 1.<br>To make it clearer: in the beginning you see the 'larger' cube and the 'smaller' cube (they're actually the same size if it weren't for the perspective). Now, each face of the smaller cube is connected with the corresponding face of the larger cube. Look at the series of analogies above: take 2 squares (the 2 corresponding faces) and connect them, you now have a cube (if they are the same size and spaced apart at the same length).<br><br>There's really not much more to be said. It's a weird concept that you have to get used to. Just don't try to think of it in terms of 3D, because it isn't.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2002 08:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The 5D version is nice by the way.

The closest example is real 3D life: you can see depth, but the depth is created by your mind. Put your hand up in front of your face. You can see the depth beyond your hand, but you cannot see what is behind it. Therefore you see in 2D. A more biological proof is that your retina is 2D, and therefore you cannot see in any higher of a dimension. Imagine then sight on a line. You would see in 0D. The only places you could see would be directly in front of and behind you. On a plane you would see in 1D. And in hyperspace you would see in 3D.<br>To create a higher dimensional object, it is said that you need to move something 'back' into the next dimension. However, we cannot easily do this without creating a perspective into the next dimension first. Put yourself into the first dimension. Shrink the line you are on, then connect the endpoints. This creates a perspective of the second dimension. Then in the second dimension, shrink the square, and connect the vertecies. This is a perspective of the third dimension. Now shrink a cube and connect the vertecies. This is a perspective of a hypercube. Theoretically you would now shrink the hypercube, but since we don't know exactly what the hypercube looks like, we can't do that. The other way to create a perspective is to extend your current object on every dimension available. Then stretch the new objects to meet each other, creating the last new object. For example, copy a square to the left, right, up and down. Then stretch each square to meet the ones next to it, creating a new larger square. Another example is to copy a cube up, down, left, right, backwards, and forwards. Then stretch each new cube to meet the one next to it, creating a new cube. Now once you've created a perspective, move the new objects backwards into the next dimension, without changing the perspective, until all angles are right.<br>I have also developed a formula for finding the number of edges in an n-dimensional cube:<br>2^(n-1)*n<br>which is basically an expression of the number of connections you can make between two adjacent points. 2^n is the number of points (a line is 2 points, four lines of a square is 4 points, six sides of a cube is 8 points, etc.), and n is the number of possible changes (one for each dimension). However, you do each connection twice with that formula: (1,1) : (1,-1) :: (1,-1) : (1,1), so you divide by 2; hence 2^(n-1).<br><br>[edit: smilies were screwing up the above bit of code]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">uNDefineD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th May 2002 07:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Atero</i><br><b>[edit: smilies were screwing up the above bit of code]</b></blockquote>LMAO :D<br><br>And one more thing Atero: could I use a remix of your preset for my AVS pack?

      <p class="post-content">I just made a stupid...I can see all the SUB-SPHERES and their rotation ;)<br>
      <br>
      WHOAH! I just noticed why my hypercube is all hugified! I was trying to solve the puzzle about the correct shifting factor, and I discovered that I had to shift it on the w-axis by sqrt(8) for it to work properly. Well, I just found out that if I do this:<br>
      a=(...)-0.5;<br>
      instead of this:<br>
      a=(...)*2-1;<br>
      (a is the axis, and ... is the tracing content)<br>
      I only have to shift w by sqrt(2) - the supposedly correct shifting factor. Then I used this scope:<br>
      w1=i*2-1; x1 through z1=0;<br>
      and shifted by sqrt(2), and it worked fine.<br>
      That means that the ... must equal 2 at the end. That shouldn't be happening! Each equal(a,b) statement only happens once, but it's like they're happening twice - they return 0 or 1, but right now they're either doubling themselves or they're returning 2.<br>
      How would that be happening?<br>
      <br>
      The same goes for my 5-d rotation. If it's just a line spanning from -1 to 1, and u, w, and z are all shifted by sqrt(2), the 5-hypersphere that it's rotating in is projected correctly in the window. But I can't fix the 5-hypercube the same way. I'm still trying to find the right scaling factor for it...when I do I'll post it</p>

      <p class="post-content">I don't think you fully understand dimensional geometry yet. First of all, the step up from sphere to hypersphere is the same as from circle to sphere. A sphere is made up of an infinite number of circles, changing in size. A hypersphere is made up of an infinite number of spheres, ranging in size. Of course, we can't render an infinite number of spheres, or circles, so we have to take short cuts. For a sphere all we do is render a line spiraling around in a spherical shape. Then (I think) you render a sphere like this several times, and then stretch it into the fourth dimension (hyper)spherically. This creates the hypersphere Zevensoft made. res controls the number of spheres rendered.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I find for the hypersphere res should be a power of 10 and n should be an exponent of res divided by 10, 100, or 1000 PLUS ONE. The plus one ensures that everything is congruent (which makes it much easier to watch).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The hypersphere is nice, but it has one flaw: it doesn't describe the surface of the sphere. Using a line to spiral around a spherical surface gives you the shape, but it fails to describe the topology.<br>
      <br>
      A better representation of a sphere is using parallels and *******ns (as in my Groovy Saturn preset). Of course, doing this for a hypersphere would be *very* hard. But it's really the best thing to do.<br>

      printf("%f %f \n",x1,y1)<br>
      f, x1 and y1 should be the coordinates for the points. The only problem is, it's printing a series of numbers, not positions. I think it has something to do with my using a C++ compiler. Could you help?<br>

      so you can basicly consider the r, g and b-<br>
      values as dimensions.<br>
      if we leave our dimensions clamped between 0 and 1<br>
      (or -1 and 1(or-999999999999 and +99999999999<br>
      (or whatever finite intervall) we can split time<br>
      easily into x, y and z-movement eventually h, p and b-rotation<br>
      and so on<br>
      so u can easily construct a 12-dimensional object in screen-space<br>

      <p class="post-content">I'm trying to decide whether that was actually a meaningful contribution or just a desperate attempt to sound cool.<br>
      The concept of dimensional geometry IS about spacial relationships. The color of an object is a property. It has only to do with it's material configuration. Therefore color is a unidimensional property. Therefore color is not a dimension in itself.<br>
      time has been theorized as a fourth spatial dimension, and our movement through it is relative to our movement in 3-space.<br>
      And what are h-, b-, and p- rotation? Also remember that a rotation is a perpetually changing movement; it has no constant direction.<br>
      <br>
      And you kind of missed the point of this whole thread; that rotation in higher dimensions and translation between dimensions is extremely easy to program.</p>

      Of course a space doesn't need to have a spatial meaning... any vector can be used, wether it's a point, a colour, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe you meant that you can use colour to indicate the coordinate of a point in a higher dimension as well?</p>

      <p class="post-content">I know what sonic.blade means, though I'm not sure how well I'll go with explaining it - I haven't done maths of any real sort in years, and multi-dimensional stuff in even longer.<br>
      <br>
      If we first of all think about a unit sphere. The sphere exists for values of x, y, and z between -1 and 1, and does not exist for all other values (outside the function's domain, as it were).<br>
      This is a simple concept to grasp, as we deal with three dimensions every day.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to easily comprehend a 4th dimensional unit sphere, the best way is to arbitrarily assign some value to the 4th dimension. Most commonly, people assign time to the 4th dimension.<br>
      <br>
      You can then imagine that at time t=0, a 4th dimensional unit sphere would look identical to a 3d unit sphere. But if you went back to t=-0.5 (keeping x, y and z at 1, for simplicity's sake), you would see a smaller sphere.<br>
      Why?<br>
      Well, if you think about a 3d sphere, a 2d cross-section taken at z=-0.5 is a smaller circle than at z=0. So for a 4d sphere, the "cross-section" at t=-0.5 will be a smaller sphere than that taken at t=0.<br>
      <br>
      You can progress this across the entire domain of t (-1 to 1). If you remember that t is time, you can therefore imagine that 4d sphere would appear as nothing before t=-1, at which point it would become an infintesimal sphere. This sphere would grow until it reached unit dimensions at t=0, and would then shrink back to nothingness. Of course, this is just for visualising a 4d shape.<br>
      <br>
      The elegance of this method means that you can assign practically any continuous property to a dimension. You can even use non-continuous properties, provided you limit the domain appropriately.<br>
      <br>
      For example, you can set colour as an example. Colour is actually a value on an electromagnetic frequency spectrum. So if you assign colour to the 5th dimension, and set "red" to c=-1, and "blue" to c=1, with a smooth spectrum in between, you can imagine a 5th dimensional sphere.<br>
      <br>
      This would be a growing/shrinking sphere, as for the 4th dimensional sphere, but the sphere would have an infinite number of spheres inside it, of differing colours. In the center of the 5-hypersphere would be two infintesimal spheres, one red, and one blue. The outside of the sphere when it was at it's maximum size and colour variation (x,y,z,t and c all equal 0) would be green. There would be a smooth gradient opf colour within the sphere, in BOTH directions (green-&gt;red and green-&gt;blue). Sort of like an everlasting gobstopper...<br>
      <br>
      You can extend this however you like. Assign pitch, yaw and roll to dimensions - that brings us up to 8-d. Assign other properties - luminescence, transparency, roughness... brings us up to 11-d. You can even use non-visual properties (as these properties are simply there to help us understand the shape) such as volume, frequency of a generated noise, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe I've explained this poorly... I don't know... it's been too long.<br>

      i really just wanted to give some imput to the topic and<br>
      it wasÂ´nt my intention to show off.<br>
      Atero: -I just ment the 2-dimensional representation of n-dimensional<br>
      objects (not just geometries)<br>
      -HPB-rotation means heading-pitch-banking its basicly just<br>
      another notation to prevent gimballockup<br>
      to explain a bit more scintific why i counsider those<br>
      things as (useable) dimensions i want to point out the sence of<br>
      distances in space (i hope the translation is OK)<br>
      a space is defined by itÂ´s metrik and the only three needs<br>
      for a metrik (distance-funktion) d:XxX-&gt;R are:<br>
      1.) d(x,y)=0 &lt;--&gt; x=y<br>
      2.) d(x,y) = d(y,x)<br>
      3.) d(x,z)&lt;= d(x,y)+d(y,z)<br>
      as far as i know (please correct me if iÂ´m wrong)<br>
      a n-dimensional metrik space can be easily constructed<br>
      as space is (x1,x2,x3,...,xn) and<br>
      metrix is d^n(x^n,y^n)=d(x1,y1)+d(x2,y2)+...+d(xn,yn)<br>
      when all properties (x1,x2...xn) are independent<br>
      so i consider every property that can be represented as a Real-Number<br>
      as a valid dimension.<br>
      hope it makes sence<br>

      well a rectangle is obviously very easy. take the hypercube code and stretch it along the axes. a hypercylinder is harder, although possible (look at the 3d sphere code and play w/ that).<br>
      <br>
      basically, 4d works more or less like 3d, except you have 4 axes to work with.<br>
      <br>
      so, you would be typing w1=...;y1=...;z1=...;x1=...; then use the rest of the engine to convert it to 2d.<br>

      <p class="post-content">weell.. if you looking at basic shapes like rectangles etc. It can be a bit confusing. By definition, a rectangle rectangular prism is a shape that has at least one set of sides a different size. So you have to work out how 'long' you 4th dimention is going to be. Same deal with cylinders, only evern more complicated, as a cylinder is definable only as a 3d object, something like (sqrt(x*x+y*y)*z). To put it in 4d you have to really use your imagination.<br>
      <br>
      For example a 4d cylender could be like an infinate 'shaft' of spheres heading off along the 4th dimention. Or and infinate series of tunnels heading off in parrallel to the first tunnel. Although these descriptions are using 3d terms, so you have to try to imagine it like that in 4d.</p>

      the problem is obviously that we are used to thinking in terms of 3d geometry. but when in gets to 4d, its hard to imagin what properties the fourth dimention should take on. Unless you are talking about figures that have equal properties on all axes (like cubes and spheres) you have to make up the 4th axis from what <i>seems</i> to be the logical way.</p>

      <p class="post-content">going off of what Zvensoft said:<br>
      <br>
      you start with a point- the first dimension. You choose an arbitrary direction and translate that point and connect them with a line. You then take those two points and extend them in another arbitrary direction and connect them with a line. This is 2D. Take those four points and extend them in another arbitrary dimension, and connect them with a line. This is the third dimension. Now you can take those eight points and extend them in an arbitrary dimension, connecting them with lines. This is the 4th dimension. You can continue doing this forever.<br>
