Why does this happen and <b>what can we do against it</b>? In my opinion AVS is the most promising visualisation mode winamp provides (concering the futher developement which is kind of broken concering the "no further developement" principle we get to know recently). Not only because of the opportunity to develope new APS's or so, but also because i like the AVS-visualisation idea most of all (just have a look what is possible with this dll).<br><br>So im asking, what went wrong? And what can we do to provide this part of the forum from dying out?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">S-uper_T-oast</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th March 2005 03:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't have enough time to understand and make the new things work.

First of all presets should underline the music people are listening to, then they can be something like a techdemo or something. Of course you should keep an eye on style/art.

But nothing else, and when something doesn't change it slowly becomes inatractive to people... And we all might love that 332x227 window the world demands at least 1024 and above.

Although you would gain the knowledge you seek you won't actually become any more skilled at anything or anymore intelligent.<br><br>Since you are clearly unable to determine the solution to simple problems by yourself, why should you be helped? So that you can bug us with more questions that eat up even more time later?<br><br>Here is the solution in slightly simplistic logic, I have a dim hope that you might be able to glean more from this than the answer:<br><br>pixels exist and have their colours set using cpu instructions<br><br>cpu instructions take time, usually consistent for equivalent instructions<br><br>setting the color of a single pixel therefore takes some relatively fixed amount of time, assuming that we use cpu instructions for this<br><br>performing any per pixel operation adds an additional amount of time per pixel<br><br>any additional computations needed add extra amount of time per frame 't'<br><br>resolution is the width in pixels x the height in pixels... i.e. the number of pixels as an unexpanded multiplication.<br><br>.: there is a direct relationship between render time and resolution which is independent of the cpu speed. i.e. no matter how fast or slow the cpu speed is this is always a linear proportion. The fact that it is linear means that there exists some constant k such that<br><br>render time = k * resolution + t<br><br>this may look promising as k decreases as cpu speed increases.. but in reality it means very little since there is still some linear relationship.<br><br>what this means is that no matter how fast a cpu becomes (except infintely fast) higher resolutions will always produce slowdown, and the slowdown for a resolution with twice as many pixels will also be twice as big.<br><br>also in more advanced renderers the amount of time used by 't' is generally getting smaller and smaller and so the bulk of rendertime becomes tied to this linear relationship.<br><br>understand that this isn't a design flaw of these engines, it is because most of the 't' time in a rendering engine is used to calculate (visually) uglier hacks that simulate effects that need to be calculated per pixel to be accurate.<br><br>this is just a feature of rendering to a 2 dimensional pixel buffer. it will never change, since the axioms of mathematics and logic need to change first.<br><br><br><br>also remember google is your friend. and searching the forums too. do you know how many times this question has been asked here?<br><br><br>how much do you like answering questions all the time? when you are intelligent you get very short tempered from a lifetime of being asked stupid questions, you simply become tired of explaining things to people because they are lazy or stupid.<br><br>what is also (usually more) annoying is that these people typically make zero effort in solving their own problems and in time come to rely on smarter people helping them as a consequence. which creates a negative feedback loop...<br><br>the net result over a large population is that people like this reduce the overall intellectual development of said population. as if that isn't bad enough it gradually leads to a retarding factor due to the fact that people are more likely to pass on this form of stupidity to their children and natural selection will stop favouring the more intelligent (since they are wasting their advantage by sharing it essentially).
