stand-alone plugins, didn't like any of them so much that i would keep them on my harddrive... tho they weren't bad, but AVS just is the ultimate :D And i wasn't impressed by the speed either, yes they were fast, but i can't see what's so great about having 200fps in 1024x768...<br><br>Also from the evil side i have tried Milkdrop, not a bad plugin it ain't but after 2 hours of tinkering around i still wouldn't open any editor no matter how hard i pushed the button! :mad:<br><br>I have AVSed for 3 years now and im still in love with it :) I doubt i will make anything out of avs ever (meaning money), or do any Vj gigs, but it's a good way to spend some time on :p<br><br><br>That's me in a nutshell :rolleyes:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author

I play my presets and presets of other people (probably played yours too:)). I do not do live sesions because... well I dont have the guts for that:D and the presets I make usualy take a long time to code:( so there is no potential for a live session there:D.Anyway I use Magix's Hotlist to just switch beetween presets+ play with AVSs transisions. I try to find the preset that would be the best for the next one:)(sometimes but rearly I mess with the preset a bit).Mostly I just mess around, get drunk a bit and have fun:D.And yeah I dont have my own projector the people who organise the event get it there:),I just bring my Oldfaithful with me. What is kinda funny is the fact that other VJs kinnda downgrade avs and using winamp for a live show, but the people LOVE it:P:). I play Intros because the name doesnt show in overlay + just to make sure I made a preset that shows everyones name and where they are from(so that the ppl know its a kinnda international thing:)). Havent added any of the latest packs yet because Im waiting for MagicX to finnish V2.2 so i dont have to do the screenhot thing twice.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th May 2003 11:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">FSK-&gt; just add em, the screenshots will be taken over if you install in the same dir [bigfatgrin]. Btw, im <b>done!</b> You can start to count the days, all i gotta do now is get the installer ready and update the language packs :D<br><br>I do both too. As said before i only use presets or remixes i made up myself to keep my set original.<br>Its important to know the music and some theoretics about it - never switch between 2 beats. Switching is best after 8 beats or 16 multiplied by any value you like. ;)<br>Almost the same size is the knowledge about your set. How does it react, what can be changed in realtime. Avoid changing code, but rotorblitters are nice things to play around with.<br>Dont change around too fast - while you are forced to look at the screen permanently, the crowd doesn't. So playing a preset between 0,5 and 1,5 Minutes is best because most peopel dont look constantly.<br><br>I love it if peopel on a party get realy interested in this stuff.<br>Guest "Thats great, who made this?"<br>Me "This is a freeware visualizer, i made the presets myself"<br>Guest "Cool, looks amazing!

I develop my presets for specific moods, music and outcomes. I run three PCs (one low end lappy, one rigged for realtime cg visuals and one for video mixing), one wj-mx12 mixer, one dvd player, one scan converter, a 16 channel signal booster, generally one beamer (sometimes more).<br><br>Generally avs is pretty good for getting some nice psycadellic presets together. The problem is that it only runs on bpm so its hard to 'connect' with the music using that only. Other vj softwares break the beat detection down to certain frequencies (generally up to 16 channels) for maximum image matching. Psycadellic trance, industrial and ambient chillout music have the most dominant sounds on those varying layers.<br><br>I don't like running my visuals too long (20 secs tops) and its challenging to get your visuals to 'flow' nicely into each other running avs. Which is where an effects/fadewipe feature of a video mixer comes in handy.<br><br>Its also good for overlaying (chromakeying) imagery on to of cg visuals and having your visuals flow nicely and flawlessly throughout the night (unless your computers start crashing). Some visuals like my kaliedascopes don't need to be beat reactive and work nicely in chillout areas.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">horse-fly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st May 2003 04:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">author mainly... i would also vj if i had a couple grand just lying around for a new computer (466 mhz isn't enough) and for a projector (they cost a lot i hear)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
