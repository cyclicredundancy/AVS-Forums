You're using the variable b. It's always 1 or 0, depending on whether there's a beat.

That it. The magical thing about buffers is what you do with them. You can use them as a source for your DMs (this allows you to use apha blending), a filter to blend the effects in an effect list (don't know how to use that yet), or just to restore the old picture.<br><br>Effect lists are just a group of items that can be added to the preset in different ways.<br><br>Simple explanations, but starting point.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd May 2002 21:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">An effect list is a preset-inside-a-preset...<br><br>By the way Jaheckelsafar, a buffer blend takes the grayscale value of the buffer as the transparency level for that pixel.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
