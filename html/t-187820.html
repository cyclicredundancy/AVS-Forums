I left with everyone feeling so up-beat and energetic about the new AVS version with more then we could have ever wished for. People had new ideas, new concepts, and all around sick new stuff. Now here we are a few months later and look what's happend.<br><br>The first noticible thing is that the community is "quiting". A large persentage of AVSers that were making cool, innovative presets just a few months ago are gone. Why they say? Lack of inspiration, lack of free time, lackluster love of AVS; all three of these things seem to rank at the top of their reasons for quitting. Now I understand that this is an acceptable part of life, but what we are getting in return is no were near as good. While I will say some of the new AVSers that have joined out community make up many of the gaps left un-filled, but I swear to god, the next person who posts a thread title with the word newbie in it, or any of it's similar incarnations (n00b, noob, sucky, etc...) I am going to flame their ass right off the fucking page. I just can't understand why people would straight out call their own artwork as noobish/trashy/sucky or anything of that sort. It just boggles my mind to see how they can degrade their own work like that.<br>I don't know what's happened here, I just hope it has more to do with a summer thing, and it will all be over soon. I can only hope though.<br><br>//added<br>A final part with my rant, the next person that says anything along the lines of them making sucky presets because they don't understand any of the math behind superscopes and/or dynamic movements, or any statement like that, I am going to flame their lazy fucking asses, because their are plenty of resources available to learn how to use them, it's just that their too stupid and/or lazy to do it.<br><br>Thank you<br>//added<br><br>//added2<br>Just for a side note, I am not going to use this thread as an early warning or an excuse for me flaming anybody, I am ready to accept any consequences that come from my actions.<br>//added2</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th July 2004 12:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yea it does suck a bit that so many people are 'quitting', mainly because it says a lot about how people percieve AVS as something which can or needs to be 'quit'.<br><br>As for:<br></p><blockquote>I just can't understand why people would straight out call their own artwork as noobish/trashy/sucky or anything of that sort.</blockquote>The reason people are self depriciating is that they are intimidated by the rest of the AVS artwork they see. Since they cannot compete they feel the need to pre-warn people that their work is of a lower quality. I think someone (yathosho?) started a thread on the deviantart visualisation forums about the future of AVS, where he commented that new artists have a very steep lerning curve to ascend and many are probably frightened off.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th July 2004 12:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Pak, That was started by nemoorange... :p<br><br>As for the quitting... i will just refuse to answer that.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th July 2004 12:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yea it seems like a nemo kinda topic.<br><br>Anyway only <b>losers</b> quit AVS... all the cool kids still do it. <b>Quitters</b> like tug are just <b>afraid</b> thats all.<br><br>I'm such a master of psychology.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Dragon-Dreams</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th July 2004 15:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">It makes me happy thinking that someone may have watched and enjoyed my presets in the past and is sad i'm quitting.<br>( and sad in a way because someone liked me then I quit. )<br><br>( and as I said... the term was 'thinking' not 'knowing'. )</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">NemoOrange</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">26th July 2004 19:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I think a large part of it has to do with creativity. I can attest that there comes a point where you feel like you're running out of ideas. It feels like everything has already been done, so why bother trying to re-hash some presets that were cool a year ago?<br><br>The other part is that AVS is pretty much a stagnant application now that Justin has left Winamp. I highly doubt AVS will be upgraded anytime in the future. This means that innovation must come from the preset-author's end. &amp; since we're all out of ideas, well I guess that means that we're going nowhere.<br><br>But, honestly, this is no big deal. There's a fresh batch of artists over at deviantART that are on the brink of their break-through release. So let's just stop talking about Jukka, Steven, etc &amp; move on.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th July 2004 05:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Your right about it not being a big deal nemo, I for one dont get all torn up over people 'quitting', but thats probably because I can download new Tugg, El-vis and Coned presets fairly often.
