      honestly.. i think that people posting avs presets in componants section is NOT fair people who work hard in c++ to make some exelemt plugs are being ignored because of these avs presets that are flooding the database.. personaly, i think there should be a whole seperate thing for avs presets. and that way, every1 gets the credit they deserve.<br />
      <br />
      and, why are there "ALL NEW FOR WINAMP 3", when there the exact same thing from winamp2 avs, exept there in the new database? this is realy begining to suck...<br />
      <br />
      any1 else think the same?<br />

      <p class="post-content">yes, exactly. AVS should be seperated... exspecally since they DO work with both Winamp2 and Winamp3. the database has been flooded with alot of the same stuff that was already there in the WA2 database, and its putting all of the great components that have been worked on for months out of view completly.</p>

      enuff is enuff, do something about this as all the components disapears among all those avs presets..<br />
      the components section will be flooded with avs presets just like the wa2 skins section was/is flooded with skinner.exe skins..<br />
      <br />
      extremely annoying to say the least..<br />
      <br />
      I'm not saying that avs presets aren't good, but they really don't belong in the components section, as they really are their own kinda thing..<br />

      </blockquote>as a c++ programmer and an avs artist i can honestly tell you that if anything avs presets are much harder to make (unless you are talking about noobish presets which do clutter everything up and should be banned fullstop), simply because it is a huge struggle with framerate and because the code is so limited. i could make any of my avs presets in c++ in probably half the time and have them run at 10-20x the framerate too<br />

      </blockquote>yes, that makes perfect sense. in a way an avs preset is like a sub plugin for a specific plugin so it isn't on the same level as an actual component. this is all more than likely the result of laziness on the part of the responsibles.

      <p class="post-content">I mean separate from plugins, 'cause they're not plugins. Way back when, before winamp3, I never got to see visulalizers other than winamp in the most recent list because the volume of AVS being pumped out just kept shoving the rest off the bottom of the list.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Sure, there IS an AVS section, but they're everywhere else too, so if I wanted to find visualizers that WEREN'T AVS, how would I be able to see them? search for "viualizer &amp; !avs"? &lt;/rhetorical question&gt; Right now, there is no easy way to browse or search for non-AVS vis plugs. More importantly, in Winamp2's database at least, the AVS presets had wormed their way into input, output, dsp, pretty much all categories. We want a team of volunteers (ala Skin Review) to sort out the db and keep the presets in the proper category.<br />

      <p class="post-content">They aren't technically plugins, but they still have the same function as other visualizations. Frankly, you're being really arrogant. AVSers work hard to make presets, too. And 90% of really good presets get ignored because the Nullsoft people will post anything - even if it doesn't work properly - and all the good presets get bumped down before they can get good ratings.<br />
      Also, I seriously doubt many of you hardcore C++ programmers could pull off a decent AVS preset. Not to knock C++ - AVS is just a different skill. Just like most of us hardcore AVS scripters couldn't pull off a decent 'real' plugin.</p>

      <p class="post-content">something else im starting to see more and more of is Winamp2 plugins being posted as Winamp3 components and then they jsut say it requires the WA2PM. i mean, WTF? if its Winamp2, its Winamp2, not Winamp3. alot of non-component things are being posted more and more often in the database. next, people are going to be posting Winamp2 skins as Winamp3 skins, or are they already doing this? i dont keep up with the skinning stuff all that much...<br />
      <br />
      and for all of you that say "oooo.. AVS takes alot of effort too, and its harder than C++"... well, ya see, i highly doubt this. the main reason why i complain about the AVS flood is because i DO do both C++ and AVS. i can whip out AVS presets over-night, while making components, well... those just take time because of all the debugging of the code.<br />
      <br />
      Winamp2 has a site, Winamp3 has a site, and AVS should have its own site as well, as it isnt just for either. AVS presets work on both.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Basically someone needs to get off his/her lazy ass and move all the AVSes into the AVS section ;). Problem solved :P.<br />
      <br />
      There's tons of people downloading presets while thinking they're regular plug-ins, who then complain it 'doesn't do anything'.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        and for all of you that say "oooo.. AVS takes alot of effort too, and its harder than C++"... well, ya see, i highly doubt this.
      </blockquote>I think I can call myself very experienced in both AVS and C++, and once you above a certain level, AVS becomes harder. That's the fun part...<br />
      <br />
      For example for my next pack, I made a voxel landscape renderer in pure AVS, without extra APEs. Doing it in C++ would've been a lot, lot easier, but then it wouldn't be as cool.<br />
      <br />
      Of course I agree you don't have to be rocket scientist to make presets. The problem is that it's simply hard to make un-cool presets, because AVS is a very flexible piece of software. People click a few buttons, think they've made something cool and then submit it as their own special presets.<br />
      <br />
      But this is a symptom in almost every online publishing community really.

      </blockquote>moving them to their existing section isnt the answer. we need them on their own site. look at the "top 10 components for winamp3" and tell me how many are AVS presets? and then look at the "top 10 plugins for winamp2" and tell me how many are AVS presets? and then tell me how many are the SAME presets?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Seriously, without AVS I doubt much would get published in the way of components. Besides, the top components list simply lists the things people like most. Sound like you're a bit upset that your work (or someone elses) isn't being appreciated as much.<br />
      <br />
      The same could be said for all the stupid, horrible translations by the way. I don't want a gazillion fan-made crappy translations full of bad spelling and dialect: I want one, quality translation made by a person with a degree in that language. For example, if a localised Windows has opted not to literally translate a term, then the localised Winamp should do the same. They're flooding everything!<br />
      <br />
      And what about those stupid Wildtangent plug-ins? I'm not a hormone raging straight male teen, so I have no interest in watching polygon-boobs shake around the screen. They're flooding everything! I wish I could search for "visualiser &amp; !wildtangent" &lt;/rhetorical&gt;.<br />
      <br />
      Sounds to me like Winamp just needs to revamp its taxonomy system. A 'top 10 per category' would fix the problems you describe. And they need to start using the bloody 1-star and 2-star ratings. Anything that doesn't suck as much as a black-hole gets 3+ stars.<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">i agree about the translations, but the only difference about those tho, is that they are winamp specific. a winamp2 language pack and a winamp3 local are 2 completly different things, unlike AVS presets wich work with AVS on WA2 or WA3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think most of us would agree the system does need a revamping, but how much can we actually ask of them? What I'm advocating in the more immediate sense is volunteers to go through the db and put things where they belong. Once the current system is as cleaned up as it can be, maybe it would be easier to move over to a new system. But, regardless, presets belong with presets, and translations with translations, and output with output, etc. It really doesn't matter how much work a c++ plug or an AVS preset requires, sometimes I want one, and sometimes another, AND it's possible NOW for me to get that experience, except for the fact that the presets are in categories they don't belong in.<br />
      <br />
      If the skin review team can completely remove skins (for good reasons of course) why can't a team be formed to simply categorize components/plugs/presets/etc. appropriately? Where's the problem?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Uhh...hello? The best way to deal with it IS to simply move the AVS presets and take better care of putting plugins in their proper place. If you make a seperate website for them nothing's going to change. Why do you think our unworthy AVS presets are getting published in your holy DLL section in the first place?

      UnConeD is right. AVS is a LOT harder than C++, and I can whip out a C++ program overnight. Except that I'm not any good at C++, and I only do the simple things to make a program. You, most likely, are no good at AVS and only do the simple things to make a preset. In other words, AVS can be harder than C++. When (and if) it ever gets fixed in the next version, AVS is going to be much easier, but until then you can't say that AVS is for n00bs who are too lazy to make a DLL.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, you're 'holier than thou' approach to visualizations is REALLY starting to piss me off. You write a DLL that's faster, more user-friendly, and more customizeable than AVS, then you can use that attitude. There's about a snowball's chance in hell of that ever happening, so you can shut the fuck up about your plugins being so much better than AVS presets.<br />
      The fact remains that the visualizations are just that - VISUALIZATIONS. They aren't about the code (no matter what Jheriko says). If someone has a vision they recieved from God for the perfect way to visualize music, it really doesn't matter in the long run whether he writes a DLL or scripts it for AVS. Now go crawl back into the cave you came from and lose the cocky attitude.</p>

      In any case, I think the amount of volunteer work on this website is already huge. When do you actually see a Nullsoft member participating in the community and helping out? That's bothering me.</p>

I'm not saying I can move mountains or making myself out to be better than anyone else, but I can ask and get a definitive answer, at the very least. It couldn't hurt.<br />

      </blockquote>Cleaning up the db is the ONLY THING I'm trying to get accomplished. The database is messy and it doesn't make finding things easy. Forget about the words "AVS", "presets", "plugins", "translations", etc. Let's use Orange, Apple, and Peach. I don't want to go looking for a peach and only come up with apples. I personally hate apples, but love peaches. Someone else might like apples and oranges, but not peaches. Why can't we give 'em what we want? <i>We can</i>, but we need volunteers willing to do the work, because I highly doubt anyone else at Nullsoft has the time. But the forums have the manpower and the precedent has already been set with the skin review team for a user-based team to work with the db.<br />
      <br />
      So, I'm asking as politely as I can, would anyone else be willing to help put things where they belong? Don't bother flaming me if you disagree: If I get enough positive responses, I will take a list of names to Nullsoft and ask for permission to do this. If I don't, I won't. It's as simple as that. If you don't want it to happen, simply stay mute and it probably won't and the db will get messier and more difficult to use than it already is.<br />

      Though I cannot check it every day, I can check it from time to time and sort what needs to be sorted.<br />
      <br />
      And this discussion is getting more and more rediculous..<br />
      It's never been about "MY component is BETTER than YOUR avs preset!!".<br />
      It's never been about which takes most time to make and which is more appreciated by the community.<br />
      wa3 components and avs presets just doesn't belong in the same category!<br />
      <br />
      That has nothing to do with "which ones are the best?", they only needs to be separated, that's all.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise we could just throw the skins in there aswell, as maki isn't exactly easy either and "quality" skins take a long time and alot of effort to make.<br />
      And wa3 skins are actually more like wa3 compoents than avs presets are, since avs presets are the same for both wa2 and 3, while wa3 skins ONLY work on wa3, thus making them a component of wa3..<br />
      <br />
      But they are listed in their own category anyway because it would be really stupid to do otherwise..<br />
      <br />
      about avs presets having their own "webpage", well I believe he meant that they should have their own tab (Home | Winamp | Music | Skins | Components | <b>AVS Presets</b> | Videos | Community | Develop)<br />
      <br />
      or maybe make a visualizer presets tab, for all the visualization dll's out there capable of having presets (milkdrop, avs, geiss?, smoke, G-Force, etc...)<br />
      <br />
      either way, the presets are a part of ONE component, they are not components them selves thus not belonging in that tab at all...<br />
      No matter how hard they are to make or how good they are..<br />

      <p class="post-content">Maki has a C-like syntax, but it has a lot of limiting factors. It doesn't do file i/o and it has a rather small-ish set of built-in functions compared to a full fledged language, for example. For what it is intended for, it's pretty useful, and can always be extended wih components, but its natural limits sometimes force scripters to be particularly clever or creative. It's one of my favorite languages and I could wax ecstatic about it all day, but I'll just shut up now.<br />

      Now then, if you're just looking to get the DB cleaned up, you go ahead and try to convince Nullsoft of doing so. Don't come complaining to the AVS forums about it - NONE of the people here post AVS presets in the skins section (just an example); I know this for a fact. Besides that, like I said before, I seriously doubt that Nullsoft cares where the plugins go in their database.<br />

      <br />
      What does that give you/require of you? Does it allow you to move AVS presets out of incorrect locations? If so, then could more people sign up for it? If (as I suspect) it also requires us to be AVS reviewers I would have no problem with doing that work too, but that is that much more work to do before the db is cleaned up. I still think a team set up just for cleaning up the whole db (presets, plugins, and components) would be beneficial. People whose only job is to look for incorrectly categorized resources and re-categorize them. The skin database is much better for all the work the skin review team has put into it, compared to before they existed.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, cheers to you for doing what you can :).<br />

      Despite Steve's words of support I have no influence and have got sick of asking/bitching to be honest. (All the proper plug-in authors are miffed by this too and it has disheartened the few that are left to the point as people give up altogether possibly)<br />
      <br />
      Goz, etc you are willing to try and if it happens that is great. It was meant to be sorted for WA3 website release but it just made matter worse if that was possible<br />
      <br />
      Oh IMHO plug-in writing is a lot more difficult than doing presets (*sigh* at my unfinished plugin in the SDk framework). I know you have limited scope and you have to be more creative but you are not writing 40,000 lines of code and have to worry about you plugin working on multiple OS /graphics cards, etc, etc the list is long so long. Hell it is hard enough just beta testing the visualizations and those are the ones I do not write.:)</p>

      Maybe you think you should review only if you can make as good a visuals as you review.<br />

      <br />
      One other alternative (Was it mentioned somewhere in this topic? It's hard to remember 40 long posts, when 50% or more are long) is to create an AVS-dedicated site... But of course, the problem is for someone to start it. Nullsoft? They hadn't updated AVS for several months (Was it already a year?) (There ARE minor updates... but none of those we really notice), it's currently unlikely for them to start it. The community? The problem getting someone to start.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't give a fuck about what's harder to do. If I said it before I'll say it again: Your 'holier than thou' attitude is really pissing me off. NONE of your plugins is EVER going to be as versatile as AVS has always been. Nor will your plugins be as useable, editable, and fixable as AVS presets. However, AVS presets have their limits, and C++ plugins are much faster and easier to program (for certain things, such as the synchronization of a camera and a 3D render object). In all honesty we're pretty even, and this conversation is going nowhere towards the original goal of rooting out the misplaced presets (read: What ThePlague said.)<br />
      <br />
      This thread shouldn't have been posted in the first place. If you'd taken ten minutes out of your life to find the AVS reviewers and politely ask THEM to move the presets, your problem would have been solved.<br />
      <br />
      (By the way, your original statement is kind of selfish. We could say the same thing about moving all of the skins to a seperate site and all the plugins to a seperate site because we think that AVS presets are all that life is about. We (or at least some of us) work our asses off to make original presets with what little we have, just like you (or some of you) do with your plugins. Put yourself in our shoes next time.)</p>

The skin review team has a ton of information posted about how to report rips and other skins problems, and even a forum to do the reporting. If there is a document detailing this, point me to it and I'll shut up and start reading. If not, can someone answer my previous questions and new questions:<br />
      <br />
      How does one become a avs reviewer? -- There's only three AVS reviewers, but thirteen Skin reviewers.<br />
      <br />
      What are the specific abilities and responsibilities of AVS reviewers?<br />
      <br />
      If you're not looking for more reviewers (as it seems you're not, since it hasn't been mentioned yet), are the current reviewers prepared for a deluge of requests?<br />
      <br />
      Do the AVS Reviewers have the capabilities to move other resources (components, langauge packs, etc.) to their correct locations? -- There are more than just presets that need moving, I remind everyone.<br />
      <br />
      I'm glad that the AVS reviewers are doing what they are doing, don't get me wrong please. But it's too little, too late and more effort is required. I'm willing to put out that effort, why are some people insisting on putting roadblocks between the work that needs to be done and the people that want to do it?<br />
      <br />
      If I've made false assumptions anywhere in this post, don't bother attempting to "nail" me on them. Please, politely explain where I'm wrong and what the correct information is. I want the correct information, not mine or anyone else's mis-assumptions.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Calm down all.<br />
      <br />
      Cover bases again.<br />
      <br />
      Nullsoft's winamp.com site is crap, simple.<br />
      <br />
      99.99% of all the AVS presets are in the relevant sections.<br />
      <br />
      If not let me know and I will move them.<br />
      <br />
      The confusion arises is that the wa3 coders are upset/annoyed (as the plug-in codes were for wa2) that there new plug-in is not displayed in the new section as AVS can swamp all of them. The individual section for compenets are all intact.<br />
      <br />
      We all want a new section for AVS presests but there is nothing we can do about that at the moment. Nullosft have no time/do not care.<br />
      <br />
      Moving the presets on mass is no a problem as they are all in pretty relevant sections of the database. AVS presets for wa2 and visualizations for wa3, the later is the only pain.<br />
      <br />
      Although AVS presets work for both WA2 and WA3 simply moving the existing wa3 submitted avs presets to the wa2 preset section does not work because of the installers designed for wa3 that some may have used.<br />
      <br />
      I feel the WA3 devlopers are right to raise this question although it has been asked before (obviously you wa3 devolpers did not submit much for wa2 or you would have noticed this before). MAybe it was a little insenstivly worded but free what I can gather it was not posted in this forum initially so it appears worse tahn it is.<br />
      <br />
      Nothing will be changed at the moment.</p>

      Report as normal if you think something is in the wrong place and should be in another section or just PM me and I will move them.<br />
      <br />
      I do not check the rip section to often as it 99% are about skins not avs presets/plugins.<br />
      <br />
      AVs reviewing is only a month old and we are still finding our feet but I do not see too much wrong at the moment.<br />
      <br />
      I made a thread about them and choose 3 out of the few that had a interest in them. there was a 3 month back log at the time and wa staff were not updateing anything. Chatting the the skin ppl 2 or 3 was a good number. Just as teh first skin reviewers there were no guidelines apart from what we make ourselves and I do not think that we need any more at the momemnt.<br />
      <br />
      So as for too little too late I think you misunderstand.<br />
      <br />
      Hope it explains more<br />
      <br />
      (edit oh and from what I understand all skin reviewers and avs reviewers can move compents around. Reporting them in the rip forusm seems the logical course of action for these)</p>

      If you look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components3/browse.jhtml?categoryName=AVS" target="_blank">AVS</a> category, you have only AVS's (just as it should be), but look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components3/browse.jhtml?categoryName=Visualizations" target="_blank">Visualization</a> category and it's AVS and other types mixed (and only 14 items, compared with 105 in WA3-AVS).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Yeah I 'just' noticed the AVS section. Initailly when the WA3 site was set up I do not think there was an AVS catagory but someone must have added it.<br />
      <br />
      I thought the AVS and VIsualization sections were the same thing.:)<br />
      <br />
      That is what I meant in the above post.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for that and obviously I will remove these later - today/tommorrow.<br />
      <br />
      I noticed the stupid WildTangant thing too. They really are stupid. I am downloading now to see if it is a AVS (I know it will not be but want to make sure) and to see how bad it is.:)<br />
      <br />
      Then I will try and change it in the Control Panel but I will be soooooo tempted no doubt to change the review rating;):);)<br />
      <br />
      But I might not be able to as the review section of teh website is so poor.<br />
      <br />
      (edit the name of the downloadable exe is AVS too. grrrrrr)</p>

      <br />
      If you see any PM me. TO be honest I more than most want to see a nice section for Visualizations and without AVS presets. One of the first things I did when getting access the other month was to move some strays in the WA 2 database.<br />
      <br />
      I honestly thought that Visualizations/avs were the same section.:o<br />
      <br />
      and all the vis devolpers I know (and know most) either aren't releasing anything at the moment or I have the betas so not been checking. But I will Keep a close eye on teh Visualization section from now on.

      <p class="post-content">one of the big problems is that on the components main page:<br />
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components3/" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/components3/</a><br />
      there's no AVS section listed, nor is there a Games section..<br />
      you'll have to go to "New Components" or "Browse Components" to get the complete list of different sections to the right..<br />
      <br />
      That's the main problem.<br />
      Then there's this:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        The confusion arises is that the wa3 coders are upset/annoyed (as the plug-in codes were for wa2) that there new plug-in is not displayed in the new section as AVS can swamp all of them.
      </blockquote>Which is the biggest problem of them all in my opinion, but seems like a problem we're gonna have to live with..<br />
      But it's not just the AVS Presets that push the few available components to the next page really quickly, translations are getting more and more common too and they do a pretty good job on that too..<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully, Nullsoft does something about it SOMETIME, even if it's far away...<br />

      <p class="post-content">About that Birds of Prey AVS...<br />
      If you look at the details you notice the word <i>AudioVisualizer</i>, so i guess by AVS they mean that :rolleyes:. Also it could be a way to lure "common" people to download it, because AVS is POP at the time (i know it's weird, but when wa3 was launched the first visualization components were avs packs, so they got a head start, but that advantage is growing shorter by the minute)<br />
      <br />
      Ok, i didn't mean to participate in the "my dick is bigger than yours, bitch!" conversation, because im bad at that :p<br />
      <br />
      But i ask the stand-alone visualization component writers to have a little understanding towards our tiny avs community, because we get crap from all directions saying that avs sucks and it's slow and it doesn't look smooth enough etc. Even our own forum mod hates us! ( or atleast is a milkdrop fan ;) ) So don't be suprised from peoples reaction to this post, but try to understand where we are coming from and what we have to deal day-after-day.<br />
      <br />
      I think...<br />
      AVS presets are like SKINS, they are supported in winamp by default and the Advanced Visualization Studio comes with every winamp version nowadays (well maybe not in the lite 2x version if there still is that option) So i think that there should be a button in the top just like skins.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Fact is, even though an expert can give a better judgement, it's the regular people whose judgement is mostly used. Sad, but true. No decent musician will think Britney Spears is a good musician, with her computer-tuned voice and silly-cone boobies, yet the majority of the male teen population obviously thinks she's great...<br />

      <br />
      No of them have posted in this thrread and are unlikely to. They keep there bitching to emails or the sticky thread I started in the WA plug-in forum.<br />
      <br />
      My views are trying to encourage the the standalone community and to help the AVS community.<br />
      <br />
      I feel the AVS community is reasonably healthy I cannot say the same for the stand-alone vis community. 1 or 2 plug-ins /updates in the last six months is not many really (I amnot count the 2 wildtangent screensavers :) ).<br />

      <p class="post-content">Atero, well if you want to take it that way then fine, but i meant that they are like skins BECAUSE<br />
      <br />
      1) They are very easy to make, even easier than skins, that's why we have a lot of crappy presets just like we have a lot of Generated skins.<br />
      <br />
      2) As i said it before, it comes with winamp by DEFAULT, so there is no real requirments or extra downloads for it, it's not like you have to download skin support for winamp, do you?<br />
      <br />
      And just because i said they are like skins and didn't meantion FIGURETLY SPEAKING you have to be a meanie? :( It's like when i ask you "How is it Hanging?", i don't mean that i want to know how is your dick hanging! Im just asking "How are you?" :p<br />
      <br />
      And because AVS presets are so easy to make, they have been spamming the real plugins/components as well as the good avs stuff, just like generated skins spam the skins that have been made with time&amp;effort.<br />
      <br />
      AVS doesn't require any knowledge of coding, just like skins don't necessaraly require any knowledge of how to use a example. Photoshop.</p>
