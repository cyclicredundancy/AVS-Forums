The other thing about Ozgur is his mix of speeder 3k and zero-g maze II, if i were UnConeD i would remove the '(If you wish to use any part of this preset in your own packs you are free to do so, on the condition that you include my contact information)' from the preset comments on the basis of that single preset.
