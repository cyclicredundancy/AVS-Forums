This should bring up system properties, go to advanced, right click on error reporting,check disable error reporting. I'm sure there are various configurations suh as disabling only for programs etc, haven't tried it yet though. Wouldn't you know it's not always the program that's at fault but billy gates sure has sum'n to do with it prabably. So it's not a big avs conspiracy. I to thought it might be bad avs presets since I had just installed over 1000 presets into winamp. Guess I'll have to write good old billy next. Usually winamp would crash within a couple hours saying some kind of vis-avs.dll error, But I just got done running it overnight with no failure.

I've been running avs 24/7 since I installed it the first time usually the only crash I get is if the window minimizes itself, or if it's something other than avs. I've been running 2600amd 333fsb at 3000+/400fsb for last two years and no major malfunctions.

I do 'know my limits' but the limits of my meaty 3 and a half gig PC are slightly more than running AVS and listening to music simulaneously.<br><br>Unlike you I actually <i>make</i> AVS presets, and what causes AVS to crash is the process of compiling my reams of code as I am typing/debugging it. Just watching one preset you could run AVS forever but its not a very thourough test now is it?<br><br>Even if a preset is written completely wrong it still shouldnt crash AVS, it is the duty of the compiler to trap errors and for AVS have a safe state in the event that code cannot be compiled. Exceptions are probably caught internally, if not they should be, so most likely the crashes are caused by a pointer flying off somewhere and writing over something it shouldnt causing windows to halt the program for safetly. Thats just my educated guess, but if I do say so its a lot <i>more</i> educated than attributing crashes to spyware or my resolution being too high.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">hboy</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th January 2005 17:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">really thoughtful and good comment, pakkie :) i couldn't agree more.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th January 2005 17:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">yupp, so couldn't i...<br><br>would be good as the closing remarks... ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Mr_Nudge</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th January 2005 03:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by PAK-9</i><br><b><br>Even if a preset is written completely wrong it still shouldnt crash AVS, it is the duty of the compiler to trap errors and for AVS have a safe state in the event that code cannot be compiled</b></blockquote>Even if you devide by zero avs will just sit there and whatever ssc/dm/texer just won't work.
