So many numbers, letters, just about everything you can think of. But it is another language to me. So i have some questions and maybe you all can help me out. Firstly, what do these letters mean:?<br><br>n, r, t, p, b, s, c and d ? they are the most commonly used letters in superscopes, so they must all mean something. Are there words that they are short for?<br><br>Next, what happens when you combine letters? Like rdx, rdy, and rdz in 3d superscopes, bt and sc in regular ones (just some examples, the possibilirties are probably endless for this one.<br><br>And finally, i read, i think it was unconed who wrote it but i dont remeber, wrote about how trigonometry has to do with this all, but after consulting the math textbook, it makes no sense as to why sin, cos, and tan have any affect on anything to me?<br><br>I know this is alot of info to cover in one message, so spread it out. People who know what tey are talking about, write about 1 topic every now and again and maybe everyone else can start to understand what this is all about.<br><br>(P.S. if you ask me, maybe you should start up a newsletter at winamp that people could subscribe to about avs, and evrey month or week, a new topic could be discussed, like a school lesson almost on AVS.
