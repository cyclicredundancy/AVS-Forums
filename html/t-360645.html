However the fact that to this day it STILL runs on the cpu is, well .... abysmal in my book.<br><br>After searching a few threads here it seems the reasons people have stuck with include the 'vast variety' AVS offers means '3d graphix cards wont help' :mad: Then we go to see that, 'oh actually pixel shaders would help if not do the trick' :hang:<br><br>My point:<br>Those threads seem to have been quite old ranging from 2000 to 2003. It is <b><i><u><font size="5">2013</font></u></i></b> and it seems still you need to own a Roadrunner, or at least a server CPU to run the thing at actual modern resolutions in full screen (which should be the point in most cases) we shouldn't have to play tricks with up to VGS res to make the thing run at consistent frame-rates in a windowed mode, and it would seem the only real reason AVS has stayed the same CPU cannibalizer is because there isn't much to be gained by the visualizer market (read: niche)<br><br>Is it really too much to ask that we bring together the programmer/ engineers necessary to break down and rebuild our beloved AVS to take advantage of modern day hardware and principals. If money is an issue I'm sure as a community we could work something out, between a kickstarter and paypal. Especially considering it's not impossible, and more people have the hardware required now as opposed to 9 years ago.<br><br>Thoughts, quarrels please.<br><br>P.S.: I am a visual lover hence why I feel the need to mention this :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th May 2013 23:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Money isn't the issue, AVS is open source.
