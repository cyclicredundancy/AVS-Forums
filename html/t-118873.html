      Have never seemed to be able to set my screen mode to 32bit and can only run in 16bit. Ive checked my graphics card settings and noticed my antialiasing was converting 32 to 16bit which I've disabled.<br />
      Still no workee. It happens on avs packs as well so I don't think its my colour range on the presets. hrmmm....</p>

      <br />
      Anyway, try using overlay mode. Maybe that'll help.

      <p class="post-content">Here's a 'test preset' for checking if you're in 16-bit:<br />
      <br />
      - Render / Superscope:<br />
      per point: x=i*2-1;y=0;red=i*.5+.5;green=i*.25;blue=1-i*.5;<br />
      (other fields default)<br />
      <br />
      - Trans / Movement:<br />
      custom: y=0<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      This will show a color gradient with a low variance in colors. In 16-bit you will see clear vertical bands between the colors, in 32-bit it should look smooth.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway this is the first time I've heard of this problem, so we can't really give you a clear cut solution. Trying 'fullscreen overlay mode' (checkbox at the top of fullscreen options) might help.</p>

      Well Ive reinstalled my system (even though my graphics card won't install because of motherboard bios conflict)<br />
      And hey presto Ive got 32/24 and 16 bpp options which all work fine.<br />
      I have tried only reinstalling winamp several times to see if this was a credible fix however maybe there was an issue beyond winamp/.avs itself.<br />
      <br />
      hmmmm...<br />
      <br />
      Cheers anyway.</p>

      Ive got no fikn idea what a 'performance' slide bar is. But I don't think thats because Im dumb. Maybe its because I haven't learn't it - along with the majority of the infinite amount of things to learn out there in the universe that everyone (including atero's) could never entirely learn even over a million lifetimes.<br />
      <br />
      But please enlighten me!</p>

      <p class="post-content">dude, what the fuck did you think 'performance' means? i mean, you started a whole thread about trying to improve avs performance...besides that, right below the damn slidebar says "higher framerate" and "lower framerate" - but you couldn't figure out what that meant, when you were trying to boost the framerate in the first place??</p>

      <p class="post-content">ummm... no shit shirlock - what settings do you think I meant - the ones in CorelDraw???. Who the fuck calls it a 'performance slidebar'. The fact that you've decided to refer to it as 'performance slidebar' or anything else doesn't make it statutory.<br />
      <br />
      I think you mean 'the rendering performance slide bar in your fullscreen settings'?? Correct?<br />
      <br />
      Obviously 'I not down wit yo funky lingo' - and straight forward use of english is (as always) a better alternative.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, it says "windowed <b>performance</b>" and it's a slidebar - hence PERFORMANCE SLIDEBAR. And a "slidebar" slides back and forth, and it's a bar - hence SLIDEBAR.<br />
      I wasn't talking about the one in Fullscreen settings, but it works just as well as an example, especially since you were using it for fullscreen in the first place (unless, for some odd reason, you were running it at 800x600 windowed with screen setting 1600x1200).<br />
