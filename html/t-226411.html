But let's stay on the safe side and for a few seconds assume the code's yours...<br><br>The pattern looks okay, but everytime I try to take a closer look I hurt my eyes from the strobing onbeatclears and way-too-fast bass spin. Better code a new bass spin that's somewhat slower. Shoudln't be too difficult since you can code that other scope.<br>(I really prefer the second Color map off though by the way)<br>Furthermore, the top and bottom really need some filling.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">qforce2</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">19th September 2005 22:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I'm finding it a bit strange that you get paid for making a visualization, since there are dozens of excellent avs packs out <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/visualization/avspresets/" target="_blank">there</a> , and all absolutely <b>for free</b>. (Why do we professional AVSers never get paid? :()<br><br>About the preset: Well... the background's okay, but the scope doesn't fit the rest. Yeah, and the Onbeat Clear really IS annoying. Overall not mind blowing at all, because it looks the same as 1000 other presets, but surprisingly very good for a first preset.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">eheiney</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 05:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The overall look of the preset is okay. It could use some improvement, but for a first try it's not bad looking.<br><br>However, considering that this is your first preset, I find it quite hard to believe that the SSC code is entirely yours. In the event that it is, I agree with WotL: you should have coded a better and slower bass spin.<br><br>In concern to the effects, the grain is quite useless. Also, why use six OnBeat Clears?<br><br>All in all, the preset is okay. If the coding is all yours, and if you improve some of the coding and work on improving the style a bit, I should look forward to seeing more of your work.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">MaTTFURY</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 05:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I like more fadey presets, other-wise i find it to sharp on the eyes.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">JaVS_v2.5</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 07:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">i hate those "onbeat clear"</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 16:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The first effect list is a straight copy from "degnic - spirit realm (plasmoid rmx)" so the original coding is by Sander Kupers (whom's preset the remix is from).<br>So yeah, you copying from other people and getting paid for it... it's just <b>not cool</b>.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">d_DaY_aT</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 17:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">That's what u think..But for me..Keep Up da good job..Try to copy more..while copying,try to understand the effects of the codes when you put it..At the end..you can be like a pro and will replace Tuggummi place..Yeah MAJOR DUDE!!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 18:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by d_DaY_aT</i><br><b>At the end..you can be like a pro and will replace Tuggummi..</b></blockquote>well, that's what you think.

You just can't make that kind of stuff with basic components.<br><br>As for the preset, it looks like a generic first timer preset, we've seen them thousands of times, we've made them ourselves when we were starting, it just doesn't offer anything for anyone who's either watched or created presets for a while.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pjw29</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 19:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">i understand exactly where u are coming from, im using rock music with avs and it seems to fitvery well, some of them are way to techno (not meant as an insult im sure you understand) but some are great, i guess if you like one music you just have to find a good preset to match it, as for my first timerness, its true i am a run of the mill new timer, i have no background in programming or anything, i just get very bored of having everyone elses presets and i now dream of the day i can jus create one to my exact preferences. ur all very tolerent of boring newcomers, im impressed, do u have any good programming tips that would be useful to me???</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 19:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by pjw29</i><br><b>ur all very tolerent of boring newcomers, im impressed</b></blockquote>Well that's a first one :D<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by pjw29</i><br><b>do u have any good programming tips that would be useful to me???</b></blockquote>All i can really recommend is <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/11200891/" target="_blank">PAK-9's AVS Programming tutorial</a>, which many people have said to be a major help for them (also see this list of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">other tutorials</a> that revolve around avs)<br>You have to self-study a lot in AVS, there's really no one to teach you it personally, it's just too time consuming for both parties.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">pjw29</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th September 2005 19:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">what a coincidence, iv just downloaded and started reading the pak-9 guide, i saw it and thought that might help. i am easily confused when trying to learn new things, good job i already know lots about physics.
