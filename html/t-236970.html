      <p class="post-content"><strong>What about motion blur?</strong><br />
      I think that a motion blur could make things look great. The only thing is that I couldn't really imagine how it would be done but here are my ideas.<br />
      <br />
      A motion blur is a combination of two frames. So, if one frame was:<br />
      <br />
      0<br />
      <br />
      and the next frame was<br />
      <br />
      0<br />
      <br />
      then the result would be a blur between the two zeros<br />
      <br />
      0-0<br />
      <br />
      Sorry for the crappy dash, but that's my motion blur.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      So, would this be somthing you would put into a superscope that you wish to motion blur by changing the colors based on the behaviour of the scope? Or would it be possible in a Dynamic Movement? I'm guessing that it would requre somthing like AVS takes like a variable of an image and somehow blurs it with the frame after the taken image. Does anyone have ideas?</p>

      <p class="post-content">To get good motion blur by blending frames you need extremely high framerates, otherwise you'll only get ghosting.</p>

      <p class="post-content">How could you blend frames like that though? There's got to be a simple way to do it, or at least fake it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This sounds a lot like something I've done a few times, by creating an empty Effect List with the input mode set to "50/50" and the output mode set to "Replace". This creates a blending effect much like what you seem to be describing.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, you can do the same thing with the input mode set to "Adjustable"; it'll probably be slightly slower, but you can control the strength of the effect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I've done it a couple of times, with multiple dynamic movements. Though they were radial zoom blurs, but the same method could be adjusted for motion blur.<br />
      <br />
      It's a really slow method though.<br />

      </blockquote>PERFECT!! Thanks SO much. This is just the effect I was going for! You're awsome.

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, then i have a completly different concept of what "motion blur" is :eek:<br />
      <br />
      I was thinking the motion blur effect of image manipulators, ie. photoshop. Couldn't even imagine you wanted something as simple as a 50/replace effect list :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, there's a "directional" motion blur (like Photoshop has), and then there's a "temporal" motion blur. It's easy to confuse the two, especially since "motion blur" usually refers to the former.<br />
      <br />
      In fact, I'm not sure "blur" is even accurate in this case; "blend" might be a better word. "Motion blend".</p>

      <p class="post-content">How about 'physically correct' motion blur? Its prolly the easiest since they give you a fadeout to start with... which is mostly what motion blur is :)<br />
      <br />
      Now using the effect list with the 50/50 blend trick just does a special type of fadeout<br />
      <br />
      new=.5*old<br />
      <br />
      i.e. it halfs brightness each frame.<br />
      <br />
      A cheaper and fps independent way to do this is with a color modifier:<br />
      <br />
      init:<br />
      lasttime=gettime(0);<br />
      <br />
      frame:<br />
      dt=gettime(lasttime);lasttime=gettime(0);<br />
      opt = pow(.5,30*dt);<br />
      <br />
      level:<br />
      red=red*opt;green=green*opt;blue=blue*opt;<br />
      <br />
      This gives a reasonably accurate approximation to the fadeout acheived by halving the color 30 times a second (like the effect list trick would work running at 30fps).</p>

      On a camera I agree that it is related to exposure time... but I don't think the eyes work in quite the same way. Afaik they recieve a continuous stream of data (photon interactions with eye stuff), and they continually update based on it, blending with the old data, much how a fadeout with no clear every frame works...
