      <p class="post-content"><strong>Worm-o-rama (need an idea)</strong><br />
      Here is a rather simple, but pretty cool "worm" effect i did about a couple of weeks ago. It took me quite a bit (because im stupid) of coding, but finally got it to work. Anyway im not here to talk about the code or the scopes...<br />
      <br />
      After i had those scopes finished i couldn't think of anything cool to add to it (like a dm or something), this is the point where you people with juicy ideas come to the picture ;) I need something, an idea is all i need to make this worm pattern work good... I couldn't think of anything yet else than that stupid rotating&amp;sliding dm, but maybe you have an idea for it? If yes, tell me :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Looks really nic, but you might want to change the name (for some reason it gave me a very bad mental image ;) :p )<br />
      <br />
      You also might want to touch up the DM a bit. Maybe have the rotation reverse every <i>x</i> number of beats... (not quite sure what x would be)</p>

      <p class="post-content">*sigh* :rolleyes: You open a folder, click on the tools or view tab, whichever has "folder options" in it, now open that and click on the "view" tab on that. Now uncheck "hide file extensions for known file types", now rename the file with a ".zip" at the end.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nice dm raz, not quite what i had in mind :p But that worm pattern seems to fit in there :) The fog on the other hand looks fugly since it's rainbow-colored and the pattern is only in 2 colors... If you want i can add that as a remix to my next pack, if you change the fog to a more fitting one :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just a point out to all you mixers out there, i will be publishing the pack next wednesday so you got little time to remix it if you want your remix to be included in the pack. Why the rush? Well my summer holiday starts after next week and i won't be around here for 8 weeks, so that's why the rush.</p>
