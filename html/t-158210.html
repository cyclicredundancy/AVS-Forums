i can not.<br><br>here is what it looked like and how i had it acting.<br><br>2 sine waves one upper and one lower. left was on top .<br><br>now the tricky part comes in. the sine waves were turned on their side. so instead of seeing the whole wave on the screen you only saw the bottom of the left sine wave and the top of the right sine wave.<br><br>the wave was divided into 7 color layers. which would respond to different booster levels for each freq. when no sound was on we will call that zero.<br><br>so zero was the color black.<br>1 was the color green and would show up with the low volume boosts and<br>2 was a lighter shade of green and would be shown on the next level of boost.<br>3 was black and would be shown then which made the wave line dissapear<br>4 was the next lighter shade of green from number 2.<br>5.was the black.<br>6.was a mix of light green and light yellow.<br>7.was red and would show up at full boost. which it took alot to get full boost.<br><br>but the effect of that was to have the top and bottom of the sine wave appear as pulsing dots some small and some filled the screen from side to side and were either all red or part red or all green.<br><br>this made it look like they were pulseing from the right side to the left side with the beat of the music base beat is what was the best to get the red color.<br><br>this avs i did i called ufo.<br><br>as it was like the changing shapes of the ufo's and it would either have one large one moving on the screen or bunches of them going back and fourth the pulses would be different sizes up and down also. loud would be large and low volume would be not seen. to different sizes in between.<br><br>and the large pulses of base beat would streatch out from thin at the ends to large in the middle. and was it was not pixelated but dithered so it was just smooth color blending.<br><br>this was the best i did and i liked it alot but i can get this to work in winamp. can some one else do it?<br><br>sorry dont have a image of it will have to look in the other computer or my back up cdrom. and see if i have one. hopefully some one can undersatand what i am saying..<br><br><br>:)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd December 2003 22:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">now that is a long read. Next time, please post in the wishlist subforum. As an answer to you question, I only get about half of what you want, but I can say what probably everyone is going to say:<br>Learn to make your own presets. We don't make presets on demand, it's a hobby. It aint that tricky (certainly not what you want to get), so get learning. There are a lot of helpful resources around here you might want to see: Atero's Primer, Pir's Tutorial, and of course searching these forums (for example the Tips &amp; Tricks Thread).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">eXp - Returned</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th December 2003 20:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">So, I think, I can help you, but draw me two pictures (I can't understand what you say, I'm 13, and I don't speak English well.)

I know i put this in the wrong place sorry.<br>:)<br><br><br>ok for those that i confused that read this.<br><br>maybe it is easiser to read this way.<br><br>1.<br><br>what i was saying is the simple old school sine waves.<br><br>one on top for left one on bottom for right. just like inside your wave editing programs.<br><br>that is what i started out with.<br><br>2. then i gave each colors by dividing the sine wave into six different levels. level one was black and was the closest to the 0 on the sine wave. level 6 was red and the farthest away from the sine wave which would only be shown up by the loudest volume of song beats. the other levels were green, white and black.<br><br>i used black inbetween some levels so that when the volume of the song beats hit the different levels the colors would look different for each volume level and the black would make it disapper making it seem to be multiple sine waves for each volume level.<br><br>3.<br><br>i then made it take the top of each sine wave and lay it flat to make it point at the front of the monitor.<br>which made the 0 line start in the middle of the physcal monitor, so when the beat was not loud enough to make it to one of the levels it showed nothing on the screen.<br><br>4.<br>i left the sine wave move from the right of the screen. as they do normally<br><br>but now with it laying flat the waves appear to be moving across the screen left to right but you can only see the top of them when the songs beat volume is loud enough to show one of the colored levels of the wav. that made it look like the colored beats that showed were moving across the screen and were not connected to any other beats. unless it was all loud then it would be like a normal sine wave only with different colored beats on it. the beats were also made to be wider on the different levels, so that a loud beat that made it to level six would be red on both lines and would almost touch the other sine wave. and the beats that made it to one of the other green or white levels would not be as wide as the red level.<br><br><br><br>5.<br><br>i realize this is smiple for some but not for others and is hard for me to explain but that is the closest i can come in programing terms for you.<br><br>i can how ever say it like this.<br><br>get a friend to stand in front of you and make a fist then tell him to move his fist slowly straight at your nose, and when he is moving it towards you, you then blink your eyes 6 times and you will see how i made the beats look.<br><br>that is what the sine wave is doing the beats make it move that way. the beat volume level 0 is black and is same as his body, the beat volume level 6 is red and is same as his fist when it is right at your nose.. the different levels are from him to you. and just like his fist gets wider the closer it gets to you so do the song beats.<br><br><br>by making the sine wav act like that and only a few colored levels with 4 colors it then looked like color pulses moving across the monitor, which also looked like fuzzy ufo's going across the screen..<br><br><br><br>is all that possible with winamp??</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th December 2003 23:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">You seriously need to make a picture of that, no-one is going to be bothered poring through your text explanation.<br><br>Just tellin' it how it is</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">28th December 2003 00:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">First of all, you're confusing sine waves (a specific function) with regular sound.
