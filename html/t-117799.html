      In General Discussions (or somewhere), I saw a poll on top forum member of the month.<br />
      <br />
      I thought it would be nice to see a top member of the month for the AVS forum. Post your nominations here, and I will create a poll in a couple weeks or so.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      I nominate UnConed</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, as Jheriko said, UnConed will win, so maybe UnConed should be automatically given the grand prize for his contributions and this be a contest to see who wins other than UnConed. (so for first runner up).<br />
      <br />
      If you think this is a good or bad idea, say so.</p>

      <p class="post-content">We could do that... but shouldn't we keep the rivalry to the presets in order to make them better, and not let it spill over to the forums where we generally help each other out and stuff?<br />
      <br />
      Just my opinion.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I was thinking more of a combination...who has contributed the most in AVS presets (quality) and has contributed the most to the forum, such as helpful source code (such as the things listed under the AVS Hints and Tricks (or whatever it is called) to allow others to create better AVSs.<br />
      <br />
      This should not be just the number of posts overall, but the number of quality posts.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i vote Gourmet. He was the first person I ever saw do good VU meters in AVS. Also, he has made a few suggestions as to things he'd like to see in AVS - granted, some of them seem idiotic to a lot of people here, but I myself would like to see at least a few of these things (I kind of like the idea of window snapping - you set the width and height that a window needs to be with it, and when the preset is loaded, it "snaps" to those dimensions. Might also be useful in fullscreen mode, to preserve aspect ratios!).</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would also vote for Nic01, he seems to help out the most relative to his total post count. He also has an incredible grasp of mathematics and aesthetics for his age.<br />

      Clashman, you can preserve aspect ratios in code fine, the crappy built in effects are another story though...</p>

      <p class="post-content">hmm... I don't know... I think i would vote for Jheriko, because of the wicked ssc's he has been showing us and he has contributed to the forums quite a lot. And did Jheriko made J6&amp;J7 both in the same month? That's a lot of presets!</p>

      Well, since not many were nominated, I suppose we should just vote among these.</p>
