The problem is there is a level of ability in AVS that you need to reach before you can start producing presets that are worthy of critique, that is why there are tutorials out there to help you reach that level.<br><br>If you really value 1 on 1 tutoring I suggest you go to one of the IRC channels and nicely ask for some 1 on 1 advice, some people are happy to help and you will get much quicker feedback. Try:<br><br>#AVS on freenode<br>#finnish-flash on Quakenet (much cooler but ruled with an iron fist by the heartless demon Sandvagius)<br><br>Its always hard to become skilled at something (and with AVS its harder now than it used to be), but remember most good AVS'rs got where they are off their own back, so they don't have much sypathy for people whining about how hard it is. We had a big discussion about this in a thread a while ago, I would link it but I cant be bothered to search for it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2005 09:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">you damn noob! You should know that crap!<br><br><br><br>Now you can say that you have been said this :p<br><br>What PAK-9 said sums it up pretty well, anything is hard at first and especially if it's something that's been "around" a while since it has most likely developed a steady community behind it with skillful people dedicated to that subject.<br><br>And what i think should be said is that only a very small percentage have actually followed the guideline: "learn, experiment &amp; create something worthwhile and don't post your first presets EVER" I can only think about a few people who's first presets weren't noobish. However, some of us posted their first preset 4-6 <b>years</b> ago when AVS was still relatively small and being developed, so it was okay <i>then</i> to post them, but it's not okay to post n00b presets today, because the standards are way much higher for various reasons already said.<br><br>It's a tough game entering AVS nowadays and gaining respect from the "elder ones", but if that's your only goal then there's something wrong and maybe you shouldn't AVS at all.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">beeferoni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th April 2005 17:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">As soon as I posted that 'damn noob' comment, I knew someone would say it to me.:D<br><br>No that's not my only goal.
