      After a very, very long time, I've made some new presets. It's a plane with some sort of displacement on them. It's just a fake bump because that way the code is faster (i think...) and a little (just alittle, of course...) easier to implement.<br />
      <br />
      As usual, any comments and hints are welcome! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice work on the dm's! It'll take a while till i come up with 3D-dms, so please don't expect an analysis of your code :p.<br />
      <br />
      But some words the look: I like "water world" pretty much more than "searching", cause the latter one kind of hurts my eyes (seems to flicker a bit and the colors are too blurred). Perhaps it's just because im sitting here with a slight headache :hang:.<br />
      Anyways, the water-dm looks nice and realistic, although i think the preset could need some water-like colors (light blues or somewhat else). But all in all respectable work. :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like it very much! At first, I thought of a color modifier but then again, Real Life (tm) came again and forced my to study a little bit. You've made it a little faster than me! :)<br />
      I'm worried about the flickering of the serch preset. Don't know the reason, becouse it works well in my pc. The blurring... well it's just because of the code. At least I think so...</p>

      <p class="post-content">sorry i didn't mean "flickering", the preset does not flicker..<br />
      I think it was just my headache that made my eyes hurt. Cause "searching" has this refraction-look (no clear shapes but a blurred transition from one color to the next).<br />
      <br />
      Well indeed the other preset became a bit faster. At first i reduced the gridsize of the dynamic movement as far as possible (that means use the smallest values that still make the preset look like you want it to). Secondly there is a way to draw the cross using just one superscope.<br />
      <br />
      Im pleased that you like the "water edit". (I have to admit, that i like it pretty much too.. let's say we complement one another quite well ;) )</p>

      <p class="post-content">:D :D That's true! We complement quite well! If weren't of that lack of time... I want to post (make) more presets! :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">water world looks really awesome. but i would have one suggestion: since we all people on earth suffer from gravity and so does water, why not make it look like real water? on the bottom of the screen to the horizons of the sea, waving like the ocean...would be really nice :)</p>
