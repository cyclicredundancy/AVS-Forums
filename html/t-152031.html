Just change the gradient to the palette you want. Right-click the gradient for adding/editing colors.<br><br>The scale currently shows the full spectrum. If you want a different scale, edit the following line of code in the frame-box of the Render / Superscope.<br><br>u=abs(x);<br><br>You can multiply it by a value 0..1 to show only lower frequencies:<br><br>u=abs(x)*0.5; // Half the spectrum<br><br>Or if you want a logarithmic frequency scale:<br><br>u=log10(abs(x)+1);<br><br>To average the values horizontally, you can change the getspec statement's 2nd parameter to a slightly higher value (1 = average over full spectrum), e.g:<br><br>red=getspec(u,0,above(x,0)+1);<br>changed to:<br>red=getspec(u,0.01,above(x,0)+1);<br><br>If you want a different intensity scale, you can add to the end:<br>red=log10(red+1);<br><br>Hope this is what you want. The code is pretty simple if you know a bit or two about programming, so you can make other customizations too (e.g. horizontal instead of vertical).<br><br>The only limitation is that due to the colormap step, it is limited to 256 levels of intensity. If you need more, you'll need to remove the colormap and code your colors directly as red/green/blue expressions in the superscope.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kaon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th October 2003 07:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks very much, UnConeD.<br>I've tried it out.<br>It is much faster yes.<br>But my PC is still too weak to do it at full screen, full res.<br>Still, it is very nice!

It is strictly, mathematically, dependant on how the music sounds, like a plain spectrum analyzer or o'scope.<br><br>After seeing the usual presets, I find that this kind of glorified spectrum analyzer is what I really want for everyday use.<br>For sure, using AVS to do it is grossly suboptimal, but at least for quick prototyping...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th November 2003 20:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I wouldn't use AVS to make this. AVS is not meant to make simple stuff like that - it would do it terribly. It wouldn't represent the entire range of sound, it would be extremely slow in comparison, etc. There are other plugins, etc. that are meant to do this and can do it well. No real purpose for it to be done by AVS.<br><br>If you wan't your own plugin that's made specifically to do this, then make it yourself, or hope that someone else who can easily make it shares your enthusiasm and does it for you. I don't think too many AVSers want to make that.<br><br>[edit]And I don't think an APE could be made to get music data from later in the song. Don't think APEs have that access. So the whole future thing isn't going to work with AVS.[/edit]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th November 2003 06:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Prototyping? So you're going to make a voiceprint plugin yourself someday? ... Even so i find it a bit weird to "test" it in avs first, but i guess you have your reasons and i respect those, but as anubis said, avs is far too inferior to make simple things (even though i am sure it was originally ment for that).<br><br>go figure... :igor:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">kaon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th November 2003 02:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I'm a lazy guy. the layout i had in mind was not creative or anything, it's just intuitive. and i was feeling so sure that a voiceprint pluggin like I want must already exist... i wldnt wanna reinvent the wheel.<br>anyways, I really like UnConeD's final result. Depending on the piece of music u play, u can get to see really nice formations. like some Aphex Twin, and right now I'm playing "Try" by Doof. nice diamond formations...<br><br>Noisy songs are usually too "busy" to show interesting structure. I happen to be really into psytrance nowadays, and it's really nice.<br><br>Also, after staring at the voiceprint for a while, if you look else where like stationary text, you get cool visual distortions, prolly has to do with your visual systems getting adapted to the downward stream of the avs. it's a cool effect seldom available without the use of controlled substances. ;)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
