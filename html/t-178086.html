      Does anyone know of a plug-in that would allow all of the images in a folder to be randomly displayed (one at a time of course)? I use to use Sony's SonicStage and it came with a random viz that had editable overlays of shapes which was great for customizing. So I am looking for something close to the same. It would be awesome to have text that would stream through the viz as well. Whatta think?<br />

      <p class="post-content">I guess that I would not agree. I think that if there were a way to use photos, pictures, etc. as a backdrop to the viz then many people would love it. In essence if the transparency of the viz were changed then photos could be used. Sounds cool and relevant to me.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If there is such a plug-in (not APE) for Winamp, then it would be used in the place of AVS in Winamp (so therefor not being AVS related). Within AVS there is no such thing, you could use effect lists indeed, but you would have to select all images manually.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And what's about Picture II and other Texers ? ;)<br />
      Images can also be used to make visualizations based upon the music !<br />
      For example, you can change to the next image (randomly or not) in a chosen folder, every n beats, or using an evaluation.<br />
      In a way, it's nothing more than a enhancement of Picture II (may be Picture III :) ).</p>

      <p class="post-content">have a look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=804304#post804304" target="_blank">picture II source</a><br />
      if you know a bit C (or any language of that complexity) you should see that Picture II doesn't read the bmp in every frame. it creates a work image (actually 2: 1 for normal mode, 1 for bilinear mode) of the picture in memory and renders from there.<br />
      to accomplish what you suggest, picture II would have to be written to store 2 work images for each picture in the chosen directory.<br />
      say we have 10 pics, and have 320x240 resolution. that'd make a total of<br />
      320*240*32bits/8*10pictures=6144000 bytes<br />
      nearly 6 MB for just 10 pics at a low resolution...<br />
      and if you don't use work images, then the rendering will be VERY slow<br />
      if you chose to generate the work images onbeat, you'd no longer have a fluent visualization because loading a bmp (or even a jpg/png) from the causes a slowdown which WILL be visible</p>

      On the other hand, I agree with you, it's not really useful as long as you can have the same results using Effect lists ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">err... pir 6 MB is for 320x240 with 10 pics<br />
      let's use 1024x768 and say 50 pics :)<br />
      that would be 150 MB *g* just for the images... i think that's quite a lot if you use win2k or even xp on systems with less than 512 MB RAM</p>

      <p class="post-content">I easily ran SonicStage's "Random" Viz with a whole folder full of 750kB+ photos. Here's my opinion. Winamp rocks because of cool people like TomyLobo, piR, and many more MATHEMATICAL GODS! I think that Sony's cheap version has one very rocking viz that sparks my imagination. So if those Sony demi-gods can do that, what can you all do? I don't know if I have clearly communicated. I myself (and me) and not a MATHEMATICAL GOD, nor a demi-god. I'm just a lowly puke. So I need some plug-in that is "plug and play" to some extent.<br />
      <br />
      I am hoping to use this in the following way. At summer camp, we will take pictures of children as they play. At the conclusion of camp, it would be SOOOOO rocking to have those pictures behind some really groovy "eye candy" (ie bouncing, waving, pulsing waves of lines, colors, etc.). Sony's product achieves this by having a second overlay that stacks on top of the photos and has very hip shapes that move and turn different colors.<br />
      <br />
      So what do you all think?</p>

      <p class="post-content">if you need a plug&amp;play plugin for viewing pictures then AVS is maybe not the right thing to use :(<br />
      <br />
      and about sonicstage: i think it loads the pictures in the background. to achieve this, you need some kind of multitasking between 2 parts of one program. this is normally achieved by using multiple so-called "threads"<br />
      one of the thread renders the image on the screen and another one loads the next image.<br />
      Sadly, this is not easily achievable in AVS, since you only have 1 thread in an APE and can't spawn a new one as far as I know<br />
      <br />
      but i have an idea of how to achieve what you meant without any improvements on the AVS side:<br />
      combine all the pictures to a .avi file so that each picture is a frame of the video. then use Render/AVI in an OnBeat Effect List. this way you can use many pictures and let them change onbeat<br />
      <br />
