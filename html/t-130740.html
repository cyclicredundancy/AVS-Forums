But like I said it was your decision to make and not mine. I'm going to stop being bitter about it now and get on with other things like 'Jheriko - Pack VIII'.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Gonzotek</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th April 2003 19:40 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">No, you've made a false assumption. Atero wasn't banned by me. I didn't make that decision. I didn't have _anything_ to do it the second time round, either. Prior to that, I asked him to change and I invited him and everyone else to enlighten me about how this forum should be run. Go check every post I've made here in the last three for four days and tell me otherwise.

Where I work there is a sign on a door saying 'Press button to open door', ironically it is in large red letters. When I first started there if someone asked 'How do I open the door' I was polite and explained about the button. After working at the same place for the past five months I am now completely sick and tired of telling new employees how to open the door, due to the high turnover of staff at my workplace this question comes up a lot. Now if someone asks me there is at least a 50% chance that I will explain to them in 'clear' language exactly how blind they must be to not see the clearly printed white and red eye-level sign which is placed on the door which tells them exactly how to open it.<br><br>Dealing with stupid questions continually gets frustrating.<br><br>Then again I find stupid people tiresome in general.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th April 2003 20:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">eg: the steaming turd AOL chatroom GD has become.<br>I agree with both of you but a simple "search the forums" will do.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
