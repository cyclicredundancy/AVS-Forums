      <p class="post-content">I dont think you can write them in any other language(try doing an APE in TCL or perl heheh)cause you might encounter this error after you rename the program into .ape : CANT LOAD IT :) Stick to Visual C++, its the best for APEs.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Kylix: this is very similar to delphi, but designed on/for linux systems. I think kylix should be freeware.<br />
      <br />
      Going to some classes can be good and free as well, some universities offer free courses for students, apprentices and interested peopel.<br />
      <br />
      Teaching oneself aint always the best method. I thought myself how to do Delphi, i know what i'm talking about. You need a lot of time and a burning desire to get something done, otherwise you'll give up soon.<br />
      <br />
      You don't really need a free compiler, there are cheap student editions available. If you want professional or enterprise solutions (offer powerfull new stuff but not needed for root programming) you should know where to get it.<br />
      <br />
      My tip for you: Don't use Visual XXX! The IDE is for confusing for newbies, even i was lost a bit as i used it for the first time. Try one of borlands products (Delphi or C++ Builder). Then do some simple programming to get into the stuff. Once you know how to handle things in one language, you can do it all - its just another syntax then!</p>

      <p class="post-content">taking lessons in something makes a chore out of it, eh?<br />
      <br />
      whereas i've been taking music lessons all my life, love to play any instrument i can get my hands on and have been invited twice to national talent competitions (and got 5th in my division of all ages and instruments last year)? also, i've started several second language classes, and would've cmpleted them happily if it weren't for the fact that i've been moving between schools.<br />
      as for programming, i tried learning cpp - the only complex language i've really ever started to learn - from a book, and it is a pain in the ass. i gave up halfway through, and now whenever i try to sit down and code something i have to look up everything i do all over again. now THAT'S a chore.</p>

      <br />
      whatever, i guess its different from person to person.<br />
      ive learnt piano, guitar and trumpet(hoho), VB, C++, html and some javascript, french and a tad of german by myself. The main difference is that noone i know is involved in national talent thingos. What instrument is yur forte atero?<br />
      <br />
      Ive learnt violin and japenese from classes/tutors, and i cant do either for shit. I spose it it depends on who is teaching you and whether you dont mind being forced to do things or having deadlines (which i hate). Maybe if i had been doing it all my life i would be used to it and wouldnt mind. Anyway, what were we talking about?</p>
