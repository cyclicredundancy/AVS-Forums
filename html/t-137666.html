I mean, AOL did pay $80 some million for it -- assuming they paid him in cash, not AOL stock, I'd imagine Justin's doing OK.

Anything he did for AOL (as well as anything nullsoft did pre-aol that was covered by the buyout), however, would probably be off limits. Things he did in his "spare time" for winamp, may fall into a gray area though, since if AOL wanted to be mean, I'm sure their lawyers could come up with a way to claim ownership of it. Of course, this is all speculation -- once Justin leaves AOL, he may decide to start on some totally new, amazing project to change our lives. :)<br><br>-Brian</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2003 00:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Unfortunately AVS is still (c) Nullsoft and was developed on Nullsoft hours I believe (if you look at the people who made it, they're all Nullsofters).<br><br>It's not a good sign though.
