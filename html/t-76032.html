      I don't know if this has happened to anybody else, but I think it's likely that it has. Anyway-if you're in AVS with a preset open &amp; you either corrupt it (because of a bad equation in superscope), or you accidentally delete it, AVS will freeze up. Every time you try to start AVS, it automatically defaults to the last plugin open.<br />
      <br />
      This is great-unless it can't locate the file. Anyway, I was giving a presentation on AVS for a high-school math project, and I accidentally deleted a duplicate preset I'd made-so AVS wouldn't work. I needed to finish my project, but I needed AVS to be working to be able to finish going through my presets &amp; selecting my favorites. I'd been using a Zip disk to save &amp; open my presets from (and to play music from), and I *needed* to use the Zip drive because I'd be working on a different computer for the presentation.<br />
      <br />
      The defaulting to a certain plugin keeps a log of what plugin was opened from a certain directory. You can't fool it by trying to switch directories; so the zip drive couldn't be used without directly solving the source-the log file that Winamp uses to determine what the last preset you had open for the directory you currently are using in the Winamp plug-in preferences window-and thus determines what<br />
      <br />
      The conclusion I reached was that if I could replace the old corrupted log file that Winamp had been using with the one that it uses the first time you install Winamp, it would solve the problem - and it did-the file is found under C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\vis_avs.dat</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yep-I figured that the problem happened to other people, too.<br />
      <br />
      Although I hadn't thought of such a simple solution, re-installation of Winamp will fix it :) . Thanks, even though my previous post was really a solution and not a problem :) . I hoped someone else might find out what I learned useful, so I posted the solution to my problem after solving it. Thanks anyway, though.<br />
