      Hey,<br />
      <br />
      'Sme, I've got a job now I'm working for Australian Submarine Corporation and I've been working 6 - 7 Days a week eating and sleeping and that's about it. Unfortunatly I dont have much time to spend on AVSing, I'm missing it tho. And I have a 14k modem, mabey I should buy a better one or get ADSL ... I'm earning money now which is good but I dont have any time for other stuff like it is being at Uni. I shall post a few of the presets I made before my time ran out but not now I have sleep to catch up on. I'm not going to work weekends for too much longer I just like the double time rate $$$$$.<br />
      <br />
      Hello Anubis hope your rocking the presets (in response to your hello in GD). And hello to everyone else too.<br />
      <br />
      :igor: :cry: :hang: :confused: :eek: :cool: :D ;) :p :( :cry: :blah: :igor: :weird: :igor: :igor: :igor: :igor: :igor: :o<br />
      <br />
      Jee be gosh urumadum dumb<br />
      <br />
      Peace to all in effect and dropping bombs in AVS</p>

      <br />
      I suggest you upgrade straight to ADSL, a 14k modem sounds pretty horrible to me, it must be hell for you to surf even the forums :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">yeh its great it takes a minute to bring up a web page and it's lighting quick when I am loading up more than one page. I can go and get a cup of coffee, Smoke a big reefer and then watch the simpsons, then its all up there ready to read.<br />
      <br />
      Peacefull huh .... how lovely, you probably didn't notice me gone because I didn't make a big song and dance, and a "goodbye" preset and all that. No I haven't gone unfortunately for some, I'm just waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over worked.<br />
      <br />
      r there any good packs out there just recently? I'd have a looksie around but I dont have a spare 15 hours to browse a couple of pages :) Has Atero finished that new primer yet?<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Good packs? Well yeah, desibel 6 &amp; Beauty 2 are the most recent ones. And Atero hasn't finished the primer yet, his a lazy bastard =p Im working on Bitmapped II which is going to be atleast over 1mb size so you better go to a friends place or something and download it from there when it comes out (no rush, it isn't coming out in weeks, most likely in months)<br />
      <br />
      Other than that it's peaceful around the forums. And lookie, i changed my avatar and everybody hates it :blah: People just can't handle the truth i guess :igor:</p>

      <blockquote>

      fyi. Finns hate Swedish &amp; Swedish hate Finns, because they hate them.<br />
      Don't ask why, that's just the way it has always been. Might have something to do with the fact that we were once ruled by a Swedish King.</p>

      <br />
      This is where I got up to with some of my developments for my first pack I'll be getting some time soon once I settle in a bit and I'll polish them all alot and some others on there way but not really postable. ie. theres one in there called oceans and I remember having trouble getting what I wanted but you'll see the idea there as it moves on, way unpolished more like experimental. there one called asubtleDM which is just that but is intended to be put with something else. The rest are more developed.<br />
      <br />
      FEEDMEBACK mmmmm that fish was tasty, more crumbs? more lemon? less pigfat? please left me know :igor:.<br />
      <br />
      Feel free to fuck wid em and postem back and give as much commentary as you can. I haven't been botherd enuf to put Misc Comments on them yet but you get the picture you pulsatingly brainy highly intemalectjal Avs legends. I tend to do alot of SSC stuff bit have been learning some DM action. "He's the amazing - DangerMouse".<br />

      <p class="post-content">aIntro2 - don't like the static text.<br />
      aSubtleDM - little slow, and not very exciting.<br />
      dilithium drive - the superscopes don't look that good when all three have different colors.<br />
      dilithium drive 4 - much better except for the ugly edges caused by the DM. Try upping the gridsize some.<br />
      dilithium drive 5 - alright, but like 4 more.<br />
      managing affairs on the 32nd level of hell - DM creates some nasty looking lines.<br />
      oceans - a little boring. needs something else.<br />
      The real acid dimension - not my favorite style of presets, but nicely done.<br />
      <br />
      I wanna see the fish/aquarium preset</p>

      Well beats the crap out of some n00b presets atleast! :up:<br />
      <br />
      I really dig the scope in the preset "<b>managing affairs on the 32nd level of hell</b>"<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise your dm's could use some clearing up, now they look very random and don't make much sense :igor: like in the hell preset.</p>
