By the way, if you take a look at the Super Scope for the spring, the most vital part of it is the 3D rotational matrix (same goes for the rotating graph, there you have 2d rotational matrix). The spring itself can be exchanged for any other 3d object, the matrix stays invariant. Just create another 3d object and give it a spin using the matrix (x, y assignmenst). By the way the matrix is a product of two matrices, 3d rotational matrix and a 2d projection matrix, however the only thing 2d matrix does is to omitt the z coordinate in the final plot.<br><br><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Karnov</i><br><b>OK, please dont do that fake file extension thing, its just a big pain in the ass<br><a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">www.winzip.com</a> &lt;-just use that<br></b><hr></blockquote></div><hr>G man, I haTe winzip, winrar is faster, better, more flexible and so on.

And ZIP format IS the best format around because it IS more popular. Just like PCs. Macs are more stable and overall better computers, but they're not the best ones to buy because they don't have as much software for them. Other compression formats may make the file smaller, but either a) take longer to make or b) are not supported by sites like, say, WINAMP. Besides that, it takes you all of one minute to make the ZIP file (maybe 5 if you're looking for a compressor), and probably longer to make the fake extention. So WHY NOT?!<br><br>AVS-wise, the DDM is a rip (Tag-Bitter Paper), the beat-response is temporary and static, and your code is horribly unoptimized. Your spiral doesn't change it's rotation and it's a forward (orthogonal) projection, which is not the preferred method of 3D rendering.

        Ok ok guys... don't kille me for that extension thing, I will use the zip format (yack..)!<br>
        <br>
        The word "awsome" was used with a bit of irony. Should I have written: "Unoptimized, fake extension, noob AVS!"? :)<br>
        <br>
        DDM... :) Grab the new version...<br>
        <br>
        BTW, what is the 3d perspective fuzz? The 3D matrix reflects the nature of projection in RL, doesn't it? That was my goal, lets stay REAL :) (But I agree, it can be cool with a "fish-eye" effect, where the projection of the spring is magnified when the spring is near the xy plane. If some one wants to modify my preset with "fish-eye" optics and post it here, go ahead)<br>
        <br>
        Regarding optimazation, ok, you HAVE a point, but i HAVE something better... a p4@2.4 GhZ :) Ok.. ok, I know, some people use their 486dx2-66Mhz... I have cleaned upp a little :)<br>

When set the fastest, there is no perspective correction, so the textures are mapped linearly, ie. good for 2d, as soon as it goes 3d, it looks like a PSX game. On nicest, essentially, it's per pixel transformed to z.<br></p>

      with c=1 and it looks OK. But there should be a way to get it more physically correct. By not using zr but for example a polynomial of zr (or what ever) that approximates the true distance dependence between zr and xr/yr, or the distance dependence it self if it can be expressed by a formula that is somewhat efficient to calculate.

        Thank you all for your comments,<br>
        <br>
        I have learned couple of things from this forum (especially when it comes not to throw over winzip), thx to you all :). I have found it hard to find DDM's for the preset. Can any one tip what classes of function one should look at and what type of transitions they make? Unfortunatly I guess they are not always combine with each other, but any way, is there any strategy besides "trial and error"?<br>

        <br>
        Spatz: Who are you doing AVS for, you, or the public? If it's for you then don't come here with them. Otherwise OPTIMIZE THEM. Major tip: Never do a calculation in a higher level block that you can do in a lower level block. e.g. if you have n=576 in anything lower than Init (beat, frame, or pixel), then you're doing that calculation more than you have to; the same goes for something like calculating sqrt(2) for every pixel - that's 576 calculations each frame where you only need to calculate it when you load the AVS. The order for number of calculations (lowest to highest) is Init-&gt;Beat-&gt;Frame-&gt;Pixel (same order as they're stacked on the superscope). Also never calculate the same thing more than once in each block.<br>
        <br>
        New DM: T goes to a constant of about 0.8, a better line would be something like this (this is just random-ness):<br>
        frame:<br>
        t1=t1+0.06;<br>
        t=1.1*sin(t1);<br>
        t2=t*cos(pow(t1,1.2));<br>
        beat:<br>
        t1=t1-1;<br>
        pixel:<br>
        d=(asin(1.05*d)-sigmoid(t2,t))/2;<br>
        <br>
        As for the spiral, try to use rotations around all 3 axes with dynamic changes in the rotation increments. Also, n (with returns for v) maxes out at 576 (12*12). Anything above that will get repeated returns for v, and a 'tail' at i=1 where v=about 0.2.<br>
        <br>
        I attached a more dynamic straight spiral for you. It has single rotations around all 3 axes, initial position movements and pre-projection position movements, and very dynamic coloring (complete with psuedofog). The position and rotation changes on-beat, as well as the speed of each position movement and the speed of each rotation. It's carefully set so that it'll be a minimum of 1/9 away from the camera at all times (eliminating any division by zero or lines behind the camera). If you want I'll show you the derivation...<br>
        <br>
        Aww, heck, I'll tell you anyway.<br>
        <br>
        D (distance from the origin along the x/y plane) = v/2+0.1. If V=1, then D=1/2+0.1=0.5+0.1= 0.6. Z=i*2-1. If I=1, then Z=1*2-1=2-1= 1. Using the pythagorean theorem, we find the maximum distance from the origin along the unshifted shape is:<br>
        sqrt(1*1+0.6*0.6)=sqrt(1+3/5*3/5)=sqrt(1+9/25)=sqrt(25/25+9/25)=sqrt(34/25)=sqrt(34)/sqrt(25)= sqrt(34)/5.<br>
        Then, since the maximum possible initial shift is 1/3*, we add 1/3. And since the maximum possible pre-projection shift is 1/3, we add another 1/3. Therefore the maximum distance from the origin in the shifted shape is sqrt(34)/5+2/3=sqrt(34)/5+1.666...<br>
        For safety we pad this to sqrt(34)/5+1.7, even though the chances of v being 1 at the end of the superscope AND having the superscope rotated towards the camera AND having both the initial and pre-projection shifts BOTH equaling 1/3 is extremely minimal.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

Yes, the DDM could be improved to something more "spectacular", I agree with you, thx for your suggestion. I really think that creating good DDM is really hard and requeres experince. That, among other stuff, aparts us mortal, from the AVS-gurus.

Things like coming out with a preset that's a pain in the ass to prepare to view and saying that it's unoptimized because you've got a better processor just makes it look like you don't care what other people think about your presets (in other words you're making an ass of yourself).</p>

            <br>
            first of all, prior to comenting what you have written regarding the distance scaling, let me express what I felt the first time I saw your AVS work. You are not only technacally skilled guy with a stable grasp of your math, you are also very innovative art creator with feeling for detail and beauty. Most people don't combine these attributes to well, RESPECT. (Also, in a way, you are promoting math as the knowledge of coolness. Now that IS magic! RESPECT^2!)<br>
            <br>
            Now, now that I have looked into to this, I realised that you are completelly correct, the projection of an arbitrary (x,y,z) to a plain z=1 is (x/z,y/z,z). And that is easy to derive too. (Looking at x (y is similar), I just used the triangle-proportion ratio the x/z = x2/1. If the plane is elevated, "1" is replaced by the corresponding elevation hight in z). I intuitivelly knew that the correct projection on x and y generates symmetrically smaller values for x and y, I didn't thought it was that easy. Life seems to be simpler than I think, time to reevaluate my assumptions :)<br>

            <br>
            I see maths everywhere, it is used everywhere. Personally I think that the coolness of maths isn't just visible in AVS, or computer programming in general, but the fact that it is built into the human brain, into nature and into the things that we construct.<br>
            <br>
            Take a look at anything and there is some maths present. Right angles, pi, root 2, phi, e, etc... These numbers crop up in everything, from A4 paper to the pyramids. In fact the ratio of the sides of a sheet of A4 paper is the same as the ratio of the sides of the rectangular rock surface on which the pyramids were constructed.<br>

It does things extremly complex very quickly, yet there is no direct communication towards the concious mind. Like for example, if you imagine an object and rotate it, your mind is doing all the 3D stuff and all you see is the picture created, not the numbers behind it. We can imagine huge, complex, atomically-accurate worlds and universes, yet we can barely divide 2 floating point numbers by thinking.<br>

            The mind works in mysterious ways...

            <p class="post-content">In computer terms I think that the best way to explain the complex maths that the brain does to do day to day things (like depth perpception) is that it is hard-wired into the brain, but there is no hard wired division because it isn't a brain function which evolution favoured during our development. As a result we have to do 'software' maths to do division, our minds partly act as emulators to do things like maths using other functions, like memory and logic, which are hard-wired, resulting in a slower performance. It's like using software rendering to run Quake II because you don't have a 3D accelerator card, the brain doesn't have any simple maths acceleration built in to it.</p>

            </blockquote>Atero, I took the liberty to take a closer look on parts of the iterative function above. The variable t2 doesn't just oscilates. Because of the power term P="1.2" not being equal to "1" it has changing (over time) spectral signature. It is slightly noticible for values of "1.2", but higher values will change the spectral signature more rapidly. Try the matlab code below (if you have matlab, hehe):<br>

            while (i &lt; 16384),<br>
            <br>
            t(i+1)=t(i)+0.06;<br>
            t1(i+1)=1.1*sin(t(i));<br>
            t2(i+1)=t1(i)*cos(t(i)^P);<br>

            <br>
            Try to set P to 1, 1.2, ..., 1.6, ..., 2.0. You can even listen to t2, if you don't want to do the fft-transform. Keep the loop spining 2^n (2^13 = 8192) times, then the fft runs faster, but you probably know that.<br>
            When P is 1, you have 1 harmonic in the t2, when t is increased t2 stops having a constant harmonic but becomes spectraly non-constant, t2 gets different spectral signatures depending when in time the spectra is estimated, just listen to t2 :)<br>

              The preset is alright but a spiral isn't technically impressing and you should use a perspective projection for your 3d code, it makes it look more far more 3 dimensional. Something like:<br>

<b><code><br>x=x1/(1+z1*0.5);<br>x=y1/(1+z1*0.5);<br></code></b>

            GTA3 is a joke. If I was making a computer game and it got into the same state as that, I wouldn't release it. Anyone who makes a game which doesn't use OpenGL or at least D3D for its graphics is asking for trouble, thats why GTA3 runs like a pile of dog crap.<br>
            <br>
            Why do game deveolpers insist on releasing games before they are finished and optimised, and why do they do things the hard way if it is only *guaranteed* to make their game much worse?<br>
            <br>
            GTA rocked my world. GTA2 has crap graphics but was fun. GTA3 was a cool idea but was made far too late and it was far to unfinished and unprofessionally made.<br>

I have a p4-1.8Ghz (1800/100/400), but I am running it OCed @ 2400/133(memory @ 178)/533. :)<br>

            <p class="post-content">Well that could also be your problem: you fucked up with the installation. In any case it's an isolated problem, 98 doesn't do that if it's properly run, XP still sux, as well as anything other than 98/2k. Of course, MacOS is the BEST, but I'm not going to go into that ;)</p>

            </blockquote>I tried installing red hat on three different *REALLY* standard boxes and xwindows worked on none of them under linux. it was the cd that came with 'red hat linux for dummies' and i definately am not a computer dummy, i've built three boxes and made countless utilities and programs and I've never had a problem with windows or unix that I couldn't handle. The only people I know that have got linux running are three really lucky dimwits and a man with a PhD in computer science who spent three entire days forcing it to work.<br>
            <br>
            Now tell me that Linux is more reliable than windows.<br>
            <br>
            Besides Win2K is as stable as a rock. I've been running a win2k adv server for over a year now, i've only had to reformat once and it was for a virus.

            <p class="post-content">Actually these days you don't need to be rocket scientist to install Linux. And you don't need to recompile your kern<u>e</u>l every time you make a modification, because most things are compiled as a module.<br>
            <br>
            Though the Linux community has a lot to learn about user interfaces. I remember reading about a 'graphical kernel configuration utility' which was simply the same as the command line one except it displayed things in a tree view. But you still couldn't use your mouse to click it. Then wtf is the point of a graphical interface??? :)</p>

            </blockquote>Suit yourself. I think that it is a wonderful desktop OS.<br>
            <br>
            But really, it sounds like you just don't know what you are talking about... You NEVER (NEVER EVER!) have to recompile your kernel. Quit spreading false rumors. YOu have to recompile your kernel about as much as you need to compile your NT kernel. Nada... Ziltch.<br>
            <br>
            Been using Linux for years, and never have had to do it. Only bored people with a lot of time on their hands need to compile their Linux kernel- or those that have absolutely weird requirements.
