Installers that restart my winamp and change my settings. I cannot say how much this annoys me. At least include a fucking option if you're going to put this into your installers<br>2. Presets that do nothing in relation to the music. Sure, they look pretty, and they may be pretty trippy, but if I cannot tell the difference between the near silent parts of a song and the wailing of guitars, I don't like your presets. (ie. dragontooth, or dragon's teeth, or something similar)<br>3. Presets that are boring. Easy enough said. I enjoy watching, say, El-Vis's Molehole...but I really can't stand soiamrebornagain's oceanscene<br>4. Metablobs. Nothing is more boring than seeing a few blobs dance around the screen. The worst part is, almost all of the metablob-inclusive presets are just metablobs + some color effects + blur....boooorrrring<br>5. That ball/globe effect (see Tugunami's [yes I know I spelt it wrong] Club Seizure) that seems so very trendy (and repetitive) lately.<br><br>I think that pretty much sums my complaints up.

Definitely true. Whyeye.org rings a bell. They have some good presets, but their installers are very annoying.<br>2. I also agree. AVS is only different from many animation programs in that it isn't static and reacts to music.<br>3. Who would want something boring? Some people would consider presets boring that others would find interesting - Atero's life algorithms for instance. I love them, but I think some people wouldn't find them too interesting.<br>4. Metablobs are sweet if done well. Now Moving Particles are almost always terrible.<br>5. I think I know what you are talking about. It can be done well, but it isn't very often as are many similar effects.<br><br>Also, I don't like overusage of blurs, or presets that have so many colors with no blurring in between them and look randomly colored.<br><br>Let's try to keep this thread from turning into a flame thread, shall we?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th March 2003 05:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">1: Gods yes, that's the most annoying fucking thing I've ever seen. Whoever invented that little "technique" should be shot :mad:<br>2: AVS is there as a vis, but also there as an animation program and a challenge for some people (e.g. me) - as long as you deliberately say "EYE CANDY - blablabla" it's fine, but if you pass something totally and deliberately unreactive off as a visualization, it's irritating to the user.<br>3: See 2. If it looks good, it doesn't matter. Also, different presets are geared for different types of music. And...MY LIFE ALGORITHMS ROCK. 'nuff said.<br>4: Metablobs ARE sweet if done well, but they hardly ever are - especially if it's some n00b using UnConeD's APE for the helluvit. Moving Particles are almost always great, except for the classic "moving particle+water+blitter feedback=DISCO PARTY!!!1"-style presets.<br>5: That's a taste thing, not a trend thing. Now when you do it over and over and over again and the presets don't have variety, it's really annoying, but if you can make it look good, more power too ya.<br><br>in other words...f00k j00 j00 cl0s3d m1nd3d p00 ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th March 2003 06:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">1) Yes i agree.<br><br>2) Well i agree 75% , but a small part of me wants to do sometimes presets that only look good.

It's like taking El-Vis's Sentinel, changing the trans effcts and calling it your own. You can't control their movement, you can't control the camera positions (using a DM on them just makes them look warped), you can't do anything with them. Why use the APEs? Make your own goddamned effect instead. It's the same objection I have to people using El-Vis's 3D code: it's stealing others' work. I for one would be really fucking pissed of someone stole my Life algorithm and passed it off as their own. If you want to make your own Metablobs effect, or your own Tentacles effect, that's fine, but don't rip off UnConeD's hard work. It's rude, and it's lazy, and it's an insult to the original author.<br><br>Hmm, somehow that sounds like the very definition of "n00b" to me....</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th March 2003 20:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Wouldn't ripping his idea of making a tentacles preset be the same?

Bite me:D.<br><br>5. personal taste thing.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>About the useing other peoples stuff:<br><br>I use a lot of other peoples stuff, and I think there is no shame in that(DM's,SSC's,APE's). If you use it in your own way and give credit, why the hell not? People that rewrite something that has been done before are wasteing time + I find it a lot more insulting if I see somethin that looks the same and is done a bit differently just because than you dont have to mention the other persons name:P(AVS IS ABOUT VISUALS NOT CODE).<br>Why do some people find it so dificult to give credit to someone else?:rolleyes:<br><br>I say, dOnt fuckin worry about it, do your stuff, be original and give credit to people who deserve it.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st April 2003 09:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by fsk</i><br><b>AVS IS ABOUT VISUALS NOT CODE</b></blockquote>!!!<br><br>/me shakes Hands with fsk</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">thepyr0x</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2003 03:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">lol whoops<br>sorry fsk<br>I coulda sworn that one was his.....oh well, I only watch avs when I'm falling asleep so that definately could explain it...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
