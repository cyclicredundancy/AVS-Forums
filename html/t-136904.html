      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hello Everyone!</strong><br />
      Hi all!<br />
      <br />
      My first post on the board, won't be anything groundbreaking, but hope you enjoy them...<br />
      <br />
      Feedback would be nice, but be kind :)<br />
      <br />
      Three presets included:<br />
      <br />
      Beacon - Simple, but pretty. Have some decent loud music on when you start it.<br />
      <br />
      Pentagram - Nice little pentagram that occasionally gets angry... well, give it 10-20 seconds, anyway. Good for those of you with a darker side :cool:<br />
      <br />
      Flowers - Polar coordinate flower trace aliasing makes nice spiky things that change on beat. Variation makes it good to watch for a while.<br />
      <br />
      By the way, I've just remembered that my screen is twice as dark as anyone elses, so you might want to whack a brightness filter on it or something if it seems too bright.<br />
      And yes, I like the water effect too much. Sue me.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, if you could tell me what sort of fps' you get, that's handy too... they're designed to be viewed at about 30 or so.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmm, kind of nice, a refreshing change from the usual noob presets anyway. Reminds me of newpicks but with water instead of fadeout. I can see you're experimenting with simple scopes which is always good, very nice work on these for a noob. I would advise checking out the forums, using the search feature to find threads that contain useful bits, the two tips and tricks threads and Atero's primer. Always nice to see new people ineterested in AVS, welcome to the forums :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Welcome to the forums IntegerSpin :) Nice presets you have here,pretty relaxing and a not the usual n00b stuff.Whats wrong with the screen?Have you tried using the buttons on the monitor?Maybe brightness could help.:confused: :D<br />
      FPS rate-&gt; 25-30,pretty fast.<br />
      Have fun AVSing!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Colours change in the pentagram? Well, really easily fixed, but dude, it's... a pentagram. There's just something about the classic satanists symbol in red, y'know :) What other colours would you have it in?! Also a nice touch to add a circle round it, if you can be bothered. I've got one with a circle lying around if anyone wants it.<br />
      <br />
      My screen? It's just old. Screen burn I guess. It's on the brightest setting already. It's also really blurry...<br />
      <br />
      It's funny though, I have a 42 inch plasma TV screen that I want to use as a monitor (that would rock), but I don't have a graphics card with a tv out. In fact, come to that, I don't have a graphics card at all... I should probably get round to getting one one of these days, but I just never get round to it.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Not a bad set there. It's good you're experimenting. It's the best way to learn.<br />
      <br />
      I liked beacon the best, despite the complete lack of music reactivity. I dunno, it just looked the nicest.<br />
      <br />
      edit:<br />
      oops, there is music reactivity, I just didn't notice with the song I was playing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Star shmar. It's the satanists symbol, you just... erm... clearly don't have a high enough resolution to see all the symbols I programmed in... er... hmm...<br />
      <br />
      Or the water effect made them invisible... yeah, that's it...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, sometimes you have to sacrifice detail for simplicity for the sake of style. I'm sure the devil knows that as well as anyone, so (s)he won't mind too much :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, here's one with a circle around it if anyone's interested. And I put in some colours around the outside of the rim, which is kind of cool...<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and since people are all talking about the matrix atm, I made something that would be good in the background of something in the matrix style... just an idea, needs something more in the foreground... but I'm not good enough at seperating layers yet. I don't know how it is done... I'm not sure it's possible, the movement trans thing is a bit powerful. Anyway, see what you think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Right; we have our swirly background layer that has movement transforms on it. Then we have a seperate foreground layer that is unnaffected by the movement transforms that affect the background layer... its output just replacing whatever is below.<br />
      <br />
      So for example we have a scope spiral with watery effects or fuzzify or whatever that produces a nice haze in the background, then a sharply defined moving particle in the foreground that isn't fuzzified.<br />
      <br />
      I think maybe buffers do something like this? No idea.</p>
