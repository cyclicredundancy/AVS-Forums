      <p class="post-content">That's pretty cool. It's simple to use, and it's a nifty theory for getting AVS to play the preset you want. I say thoery because, unfortunately, on my machine, it did not work with random on. It worked if I pressed space, so I do not see why random would not work unless winamp does not rescan the dir when selecting a new preset. The advantage that this has oer the one made by magic.x in the random function, and that it has the transition effects.<br />
      <br />
      You might want to include the documentation in the install of the program, and a help screen would be good too.</p>

      I hope Unconed can answer this question: how can I send a keystroke to the AVS display window using VB ? ( if you know how to do it in C++ tell me too and I'll try to translate...) If I could do that, my app would really be a LLLLOOOOOTTTTTT better :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mucks, i designed Hotlist as a Live-act Tool. Thats why i didnt include random features but pictures instead, nobody can remember each of 150 Presets just by name ;) i think geobish's prog will be better for your purpose.<br />
      <br />
      Geobish, i had those problems too programming hotlist. But i did it in Delphi, so it might be diffrent in VB. If you want to send AVS a message you have to understand that everything goes through Windows Messages (i think there are some hints on the developer page). Maybe you have WinSight. This Tool shows all Messages that are sent between Applications. Just look at the Messages that AVS sends and receives when you press a Key, there are plenty of them: KeyDown, KeyUp, KeyPress and others that won't interest you. First, you'll have to find the Handle of AVS. You can get the informations you need throuh WinSight too. In general the nam should be avswnd. once you have the handle, you can send windows messages to AVS, keystrokes or whatever. You'd better look those things up in your VB Help, that may be a bit hard, but the best possibillity to do it. And would you please add a ENglish version to your Homepage? My French is really bad and maybe there are others who will be confused too... :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks, I'll try to find WinSight ( I hope it's freeware ) and I'll wait for Unconed to answer ( Unconed u're really great :) ), I think I'll also include an hotkey manager in my app ( for the manual mode ), I think this won't be too much dificult ( just have to mess with the APH files ),For my webpage in french, it's part of our VJ team website ( <a href="http://www.vfx.fr.st" target="_blank">http://www.vfx.fr.st</a> ) but I think I'll realease an english version of this page and of the doc for Playlister...Don't forget: suggestions are welcome...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I suppose I could take a crack at translating the docs with my knowing enough french to talk down a speeding ticked in french, im Quebec.<br />
      <br />
      As to the random problem I was having. It workrd fine in your program but not in Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      Wait, wait.<br />
      <br />
      Me dumb. Forgot that winamp does not do random switches while the edit window is open. :hang:<br />
      <br />
      I do have as suggestion though. Perhaps when you figure out how to send messages to AVS, make it so it sends a space keypress to AVS instead of you having to use the random switcher. That way you don't have to go the the presets/hotkeys screen if you want to stop constart refreshing of the preset, just stop the manager.</p>

      Ok, Unconed don't know how to do that ( you can't know everything guy :)), so do anyone know how I can use Win32 APIs to send a keystroke to the AVS render window via my VB program ?<br />
      Note to Unconed: if you know how to do it in another langage please let me know and I'll try to translate (my problem is that I don't know very much about Win32 APIs but I know I can use SendMessage in VB)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you can use sendmessage, simply send a pair of WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP with the correct scan code. Here's the docs for them:<br />
      <br />
      <font face="courier new"><br />
      WM_KEYDOWN<br />
      nVirtKey = (int) wParam; // virtual-key code<br />
      lKeyData = lParam; // key data<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The WM_KEYDOWN message is posted to the window with the keyboard focus when a nonsystem key is pressed. A nonsystem key is a key that is pressed when the ALT key is not pressed.<br />
      <br />
      Parameters<br />
      nVirtKey<br />
      Value of wParam. Specifies the virtual-key code of the nonsystem key.<br />
      lKeyData<br />
      Value of lParam. Specifies the repeat count, scan code, extended-key flag, context code, previous key-state flag, and transition-state flag, as shown in the following table:<br />
      <br />
      Value Description<br />
      <br />
      0-15 Specifies the repeat count. The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user holding down the key.<br />
      16-23 Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).<br />
      24 Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.<br />
      25-28 Reserved; do not use.<br />
      29 Specifies the context code. The value is always 0 for a WM_KEYDOWN message.<br />
      30 Specifies the previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.<br />
      31 Specifies the transition state. The value is always 0 for a WM_KEYDOWN message.<br /></font><br />
      <br />
      And<br />
      <br />
      <font face="courier new"><br />
      WM_KEYUP<br />
      nVirtKey = (int) wParam; // virtual-key code<br />
      lKeyData = lParam; // key data<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The WM_KEYUP message is posted to the window with the keyboard focus when a nonsystem key is released. A nonsystem key is a key that is pressed when the ALT key is not pressed, or a keyboard key that is pressed when a window has the keyboard focus.<br />
      Parameters<br />
      nVirtKey<br />
      Value of wParam. Specifies the virtual-key code of the nonsystem key.<br />
      lKeyData<br />
      Value of lParam. Specifies the repeat count, scan code, extended-key flag, context code, previous key-state flag, and transition-state flag, as shown in the following table:<br />
      <br />
      Value Description<br />
      <br />
      0-15 Specifies the repeat count. The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user holding down the key. The repeat count is always one for a WM_KEYUP message.<br />
      16-23 Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).<br />
      24 Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.<br />
      25-28 Reserved; do not use.<br />
      29 Specifies the context code. The value is always 0 for a WM_KEYUP message.<br />
      30 Specifies the previous key state. The value is always 1 for a WM_KEYUP message.<br />
      31 Specifies the transition state. The value is always 1 for a WM_KEYUP message.<br /></font></p>

      It's there..Version 1.1, now it's totally automated, so you don't need any more to close the config window and you can switch off the randomly switch preset...It still got a little bug when it is in manual mode, you sometime have to click twice on a preset for it to be loaded..Now the interface is in English :) but the doc is still in french (I'm waiting for someone to translate :))<br />

      Again another version...Now you can take snapshots of the presets while in "play" mode and they will appear in "manage mode" and the little bug I had mentionned isn't there any more...Now I know (a bit) more about WIN32 API I can do a LLLOOOTTT of neat things...Cool !

      <p class="post-content"><strong>oups...big bug...</strong><br />
      I find out there is a bug in my app (thanks Trolls and BonnetRose): it won't run if office 97 or later isn't installed on your PC...That's because fm20.dll (I use it for spinbuttons) correctly register only if office is installed.If you launch it on a PC where office 97 or later isn't installed, you got a system error &amp;H8007007E module not found...I'll try to find a replacement today and to publish a clean version this afternoon...Sorry for the convenience...</p>

      I just finished v1.3.4, new features and bugfixes:<br />
      - minor bugfixes<br />
      - fixed bug that caused playlister to crash when clicking the new “send all to playlist” button…(oops…)<br />
      - better time management (but still not 100% accurate…)<br />
      - interface modifications<br />
      - prev/next buttons now 100% functional, no more depending of the current playing mode<br />
      - added buttons in settings window to quickly change AVS display window size to “standard” sizes when playlister runs: 160x120, 320x240, 352x288 and 640x480 or to a custom size-&gt; I had this idea while looking into the AVS Wishlist forum<br />

      here it is :) new in this version:<br />
      <br />
      - added “delete from hard drive” button (ask for confirmation option in settings)<br />
      - reshaped thumbnail view to 4/3 aspect ratio<br />
      - snapshots are now saved in JPEG at thumbnail size(103x76) instead of BMP at current AVS window size to save space on your HD (files are about 30 times smaller), but your old snapshots are still compatibles :)<br />
      - disable screen saver while playlister is running<br />

      The program seems like exactly what I need to run visuals - except for this one glitch. Any ideas what's wrong?<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hi!</strong><br />
      Hi guy! Did you read the doc ? The folder in presets/hotkeys in AVS must be AVSPL and randomly switch presets must be off...And in playlister you need to go to file/settings to set your AVS dir location....<br />
      <br />
      I just think you have a setting problem...Try what's above and I think it should work :) If not send me private message and I will try to help you since you're the only one to have this problem.<br />
      <br />
      I had a problem with my website yesterday: I reached maximum bandwith on Tripod and the page has been unavaillable for 1 or 2 hours...I'll try to change the location of the files today so the problem won't occur anymore...sorry<br />
      <br />
      I'm actually finishing v1.4, now it include a keyboard manager (for hotkeys) and a few more things...I'll post here when it's finished...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Surely you don't hardcode every possible layout in code??? Why not use Win32 API functions to do the conversion? Don't re-invent the wheel... You can use ToAscii()/ToUnicode() to convert scancodes into the correct character, and it even handles 'dead' keys (keys that combine with the next one you press).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The Belgian keyboard layout is similar but still different from the french layout (only the letter layout is the same: AZERTY). In any case, I think you should really find another way other than storing all the known keyboard maps. Not only is it a lot of work, it's also a bad programming practice to do these kinds of things yourself.<br />
      <br />
      Have you tried sending WM_CHAR messages by the way? That way you only need the character value, not the scancode. Normally these are generated by the receiving application's TranslateMessage() (when it receives a WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP pair), but maybe you could send them directly?<br />
      <br />
      I guess the alternative is to use a 'real' programming language :) :p.</p>

Every time i clicked on it, a diffrent preset was loaded, but never that one that i added (maybe i stopped clicking too early?). It was like pressing the space bar.

      your problem is that you haven't set avs corectly:<br />
      in avs, go to presets/hotkeys and set AVSPL as dir...and the problem is gone....In the next version i'll handle presets loading in another way so you won't have to set up avs this way anymore...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Goebish, I think I may have found a solution to your keyboard-layout problem. I've been poking around with keyboard functions :). I don't know if this will work in VB though...<br />
      <br />
      <font face="courier new"><br />
      The VkKeyScan function translates a character to the corresponding virtual-key code and shift state for the current keyboard.<br />
      <br />
      SHORT VkKeyScan(<br />
      TCHAR ch // character to translate<br />
      );<br />
      <br />
      <b>Parameters</b><br />
      ch<br />
      Specifies the character to be translated into a virtual-key code.<br />
      Return Values<br />
      <br />
      <b>Return Value</b><br />
      If the function succeeds, the low-order byte of the return value contains the virtual-key code and the high-order byte contains the shift state, which can be a combination of the following flag bits.<br />
      <br />
      Bit Meaning<br />
      1 Either shift key is pressed.<br />
      2 Either CTRL key is pressed.<br />
      4 Either ALT key is pressed.<br />
      8 The Hankaku key is pressed<br />
      16 Reserved (defined by the keyboard layout driver).<br />
      32 Reserved (defined by the keyboard layout driver).<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      If the function finds no key that translates to the passed character code, both the low-order and high-order bytes contain –1.<br />
      <br />
      Remarks<br />
      For keyboard layouts that use the right-hand alt key as a shift key (for example, the French keyboard layout), the shift state is represented by the value 6, because the right-hand alt key is converted internally into ctrl+alt.<br />
      <br />
      Translations for the numeric keypad (VK_NUMPAD0 through VK_DIVIDE) are ignored. This function is intended to translate characters into keystrokes from the main keyboard section only. For example, the character "7" is translated into VK_7, not VK_NUMPAD7.<br />
      <br />
      VkKeyScan is used by applications that send characters by using the WM_KEYUP and WM_KEYDOWN messages.<br />
      <br />
      QuickInfo<br />
      ...<br />
      Import Library: Use user32.lib<br /></font><br />
      <br />
      <br />
      By using this function, you can convert character back into key codes. This means you don't need to store keyboard layouts, right?<br />
      <br />
      From what I know about VB, you should be able to import this function from user32.dll/lib from this definition.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Here are some corrections on the documentation btw:<br />
      <br />
      ...This tool <u>allows</u> you to choose... (beginning)<br />
      ...but your old snapshots are still <u>compatible</u> (adjectives don't change in English :))<br />
      ...prev/next buttons now 100% functional, no more depending <u>on</u> the...<br />
      ...to write after <u>I'd</u> seen/heard many peoples saying that one of the <u>most wanted features</u> in AVS was that...<br />
      ...AVS presets! You can get some at <u>http://www.winamp.com/plugins/</u>...<br />
      ...I recommend a minimum of a 400 MHz processor (<u>but a high-end machine is really the only way to</u>)...<br />
      <br />
      I know French too by the way (though I suck at speaking/writing, I can understand it well), so if you need some help with translations, just ask :).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>v1.4.1</strong><br />
      v1.4.1 is on my website: <a href="http://vfxsoftwares.fr.st" target="_blank">http://vfxsoftwares.fr.st</a><br />
      <br />
      -now compatible with EVERY keyboard of the world ;) (excepted some japanese keyboards maybe)<br />
      -fixed lot of minor and not so minor bugs<br />
      -reduced preset loading lag time a lot<br />
      <br />
      This version need at least directX 7 to work (I now use Direct Input for keyboard handling:))<br />
      <br />
      note for unconed: I'll re-write the doc in french so you can translate it to 'good' english :) thanks<br />

      </blockquote>Ok goebish i'm going to save your life right here.<br />
      TRASH the installer you made with microsoft wizard and learn to use the Nsis Programming language for making very powerful Installers.<br />
      Nsis is much easier to learn and use and also provides more features then microsoft Install provides.

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm .. This little proggy is like 5 or 6 years old and I'm not planning to update it (this was one of my first app for WIN32)<br />
      <br />
      I suggest you to use hotlist from Magic.X, I think it's still updated and it provide more functionalities than Playlister.<br />
      <br />
      To Nanakiwurkz: I don't use M$ Wizard anymore for my installers, I now use Inno Setup, which I think is more powerfull than NSIS.</p>
