      <p class="post-content">Just to keep you guys interested I've seen all the presets and its shaped up to be a very nice pack, I dont think you'll be dissapointed. J is trying to finish his APE so it can be released as a new (final?) version with the pack, I'm re-naming the files for consistency. Later we might work on an intro and installer.</p>

      Hahaha, you want so badly to be 1337 that you will resort to <b>anything</b>! hahaha!<br>
      <br>
      You really shouldn't be saying people have a bad real life when you know <b>absolutly nothing</b> about them.<br>
      <br>
      Im 1337 and you're a n00b, reallife(tm) has nothing to do with that fact.<br>

          #AVS is better because:<br>
          <br>
          - It has UnConeD<br>
          - Less disconnections<br>
          - You can register your nick (so none can steal it from you)<br>
          - You don't need a bot for your channel, because of ChanServ<br>
          - Topic's actually show up<br>
          - No mentally sick nazi-operator who will kick you if he has had enough beer.</p>

Well there might be some cool stuff in between my work. Thank god you said 'make <u>cool</u> enough presets' cause i somewhat dislike the 'techdemo preset' hype there is (no i'm not just too lazy to learn the code). Of course, most code-heavy presets are awesome, but i've seen rather ugly presets containing loads of code and claiming to be cool... oh sorry i derailed <i>a tiny bit</i> :D<br>
          <br>
          However, at first i should consider if i ever want to become 1337 :p<br>

            <p class="post-content">I've mailed the pack installer complete with a finished intro to WotL. I know I should have done it on Friday.... but I took my time about it and made a (disproportionately) complicated intro.<br>
            <br>
            I reckon we should start a new da account if there are going to be more winamp forums packs. Its just tidy... and it won't clutter up one of our personal pages with comments intended for the pack(s). I'd recommend a simple name like waforums or something.... I would rather not post it on my own account, but have no objections to WotL or anyone else posting it on theirs.<br>
            <br>
            This thread is starting to get way to long...<br>
            <br>
            edit: okay so i made the effort to read what came before and i'm submitting the pack. i'll put it in to winamp under my user with a comment to attribute it to the community. i'll submit it to da with a new account unless someone particularly wants it on theirs and posts back before i fall asleep and wake up again.</p>

            IMHO it's ok what you did so far concerning publishing. That new da.com account is fine for me too. Did you open it already? And if so: under which name?<br>
            <br>
            btw, not only this thread is getting much to long, but also the pack itself took much time for planning and carrying out!</p>

            anyway, that account is good, everything important has been mentioned (except the pack: want it NOW!...). btw who will manage that account? What kind of stuff are we going to release there except the pack? Shall we publish other stuff than preset packs anyway?</p>

            <p class="post-content">It's ok now, ishan. finally i got the pack, too!! Also we needed a 'beta-tester' right? ;)<br>
            <br>
            And yeah, count me in for Compilation 2! :D<br>
            <br>
            <font size="1">btw wouldn't it be nice if we extend the remixing part a bit more? For example everyone could receive the presets from two others (but doesn't necessarily have to remix all of them). Just an first idea...</font></p>
