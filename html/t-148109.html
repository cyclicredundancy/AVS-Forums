      <p class="post-content"><strong>Bezier curve</strong><br />
      Lately I lack of creativity but i have trying to do more math in avs... so I got bored as hell and did some curve ssc's.<br />
      This is my best one so far:<br />
      Bezier curve with 10 control points, its not hard to add more control points but we got one "lovely" thing called varjable limit :(<br />
      <br />
      Anyways... its not some kind of nice-looking-preset, it is basicly a ssc... but i goes REALLY well with heavy beat ;)<br />
      It is not very optimized, but doing it is a big pain in the ass... even when dealing with 4 control point curve :(<br />
      <br />
      If anyone want to know how the Bezier curve works just say it... I will try to do tutorial<br />
      <br />
      So here it is, enjoy :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's nice, but it's not the most interesting thing. It does do well on heavy beats(I was listening to godsmack at the time). The only thing I can think of to make it more interesting would be to do it in 3 Dimensions. Oh, and don't display the control points with your final version - it doesn't look that great.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Make 3d... I think it will be impossible coz i need 60 varjables... for only point movement (beat and per frame)<br />
      Ofcource i will delete the control points on final version</p>

      <p class="post-content">You can cut down on the variables used. For example - don't store x0, y0, etc. Just use sin(a), cos(a), etc. It makes it slower, but that could end up being better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i still think its impossible... i allready got 46 varjable on 2d version... another way could be using less control points... 7 control point one shoul allready be possible, i hope</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think it would be possible to make it 3-D, you just have to use some creative ways to store variables. It would be almost impossible though, it would take a little bit of work, nice job on the 2-d version though</p>

      <p class="post-content">I would do it(3D), but I don't feel like figuring out how bezier curves work right now. They aren't that difficult from what I gather about them, but bleh. Right now, it's just not interesting enough - adding another dimension would help, but it would still be lacking some I think.</p>

      </blockquote>Yay1 this is good idea, and isnt THAT hard... maybe just slow, ill start working on it when i got some spare time (you know, school :hang: )<br />
      <br />
      [edit]I havent figured out yet how to make continious curve, that may make things uglier[/edit]

      <p class="post-content">Rather than using such large amounts of control points, you should stick to cubic beziers (i.e. 4 control points). More than 4 doesn't really add much extra flexibility.<br />
      By piecing many cubic beziers together, you can create nice, varied, smooth curves.<br />
      <br />
      For C1 continuity, make sure that the control points line up at the switch from one bezier to another. I.e.<br />
      <br />
      Suppose you have control points:<br />
      <br />
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7<br />
      <br />
      Then you can create two cubic beziers, namely 1-2-3-4 and 4-5-6-7. For C1 continuity (smooth curve), you need to make sure that points 3-4-5 lie on one line. For continuous curvature, you need to make sure that the distance 3-4 is the same as 4-5.<br />
      To combine these two, you can just 'mirror' point 3 around point 4 to get point 5 (this saves you some variables btw):<br />
      <br />
      Add the coordinate difference from 3 to 4 to the coordinate of 4 to get the coordinate of 5:<br />
      <br />
      x5 = x4 + (x4 - x3) = 2*x4 - x3<br />
      y5 = y4 + (y4 - y3) = 2*y4 - y3<br />
      <br />
      That's how I made my avatar... I create one cubic bezier 1-2-3-4, and then connect the ends with another cubic bezier 4-5-6-7 that is completely defined by the first bezier (p7 = p1, p6 = p2 mirrored around p1, p5 = p3 mirrored around p4, p4 = p4).<br />
      <br />
      A forum search for bezier or bézier should turn up some stuff.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and if you need to evaluate polynomials, it's usually best to write everything grouped by coefficient of 'x' or 't' or whatever, and then do:<br />
      <br />
      ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d<br />
      = ((a*x + b)*x + c)*x + d<br />
      (Horner's scheme)<br />
      Much faster and less multiplications required.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Zevensoft: you may be right about that, but AVS does a jump for every possible operation, so less brackets doesn't really matter.<br />
      <br />
      e.g. C=A*B<br />
      <br />
      jump into multiplication routine<br />
      jump into routine to load A, return<br />
      jump into routine to load B, return<br />
      multiply, return<br />
      jump into routine to save into C, return<br />
      <br />
      So while there would be more jumps due to brackets, there'd be less multiplications. For a quadratic or cubic, this might be disadvantageous, but for quintics or higher I'm pretty sure horner's scheme still has the advantage, even on AVS.</p>
