If you want to learn avs the best way is to look at existing presets and figure out how they work for yourself, the second thing to do is to look at the threads referenced in the FAQ. There are a few more threads around where you can get some other useful information, there a few linked too in this thread (which was started by a model noob)<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=108533" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=108533</a><br><br>That post about linear equations I'm guessing was the one where I was trying to show Xion how to do simple superscopes. You can convert any 'graph' to AVS superscope by using x=2*i-1; and then putting the y function after it, if it isn't linear you'll need n&gt;2.<br><br>The fact of the matter is that you will probably have to do most of your learning for yourself. I learned almost everything I now know about AVS without the help of these forums or any readmes or FAQs, I'm sure that everyone learns the basics themselves then comes here when they get stuck on something.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">topgunryu</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2002 02:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>*le sigh* :-\</strong><br>ok, ok... i apologize. i already <i>did</i> metion that i didnt spend too much time searching for sources before i posted, it was rather hasty of me. i didnt really think i would understand anything, since i dont know anything to begin with. all i saw was things i didnt understand, and for the most part saw threads where people knew what they were talking about (except for the minor detail that they didnt understand, which is what they posted about), but now that i have looked at the FAQs i see that they are explained as simply as possible for something that isnt really, or at first at least. nevertheless, thanks for the links.<br><br>sorry!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2002 02:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Apology gladly accepted.

Please post it in the AVS preset section when you have something cool, so we can take a look and help you if needed.
