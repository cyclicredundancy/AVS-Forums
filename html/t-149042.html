It's obviously not a per-pixel code evaluator, because that should be dead-slow, and the CMo* isn't.<br><br>Here's where the problems start...<br><br><b>Example 'Solarization'</b> (this is a chrome filter btw)<br>red=(min(1,red*2)-red)*2;<br>green=red; blue=red;<br><br>If we view this piece as something that gets executed like in a superscope, then the result is incorrect. The final two statements cause red to equal green and blue, so the result would be a grayscale image. But it isn't.<br><br>So here's what I think the CMo does...<br><br>The init, frame and beat codes are run like any other component, though are only really useful if you use "recompute every frame".<br><br>The level code is run 256 times once, with a 256-shades grayscale ramp as the input. In the beginning of the code, red=green=blue. So the input/output has nothing to do with the pixels in the image, but rather defines a general transformation for colors.<br><br>The output is a 256-color palette, which can be seen as 3 color maps which each operate only inside their own channel: one for red, one for green, one for blue.<br><br>Imagine a colormap APE where there are 3 gradients rather than one, but the first gradient is limited to pure red colors, the second gradient to pure green colors, the third to pure blue colors.<br>Per pixel, the color is split into channels: red, green, blue.<br>Each is used as an index into one of the colormaps (red for the first, green for the second, blue for the last). The values in the Rgb channels are replaced by their respective mappings in their gradient.<br>Then the result is assembled back into a pixel and written out.<br><br>So that explains why the solarization code works. If the input is RGB(150,150,150), it will first calculate the solarization of the red component. That's 210. Then it sets the same value for the green and blue component. The output is RGB(210,210,210).<br>If we do this for every grayscale input, the three channels of the output pallete will contain the solarized version of their value.<br><br>By applying these 3 solarization maps to an RGB pixel, we get a per-channel solarized version.<br><br>So what is the use of mixing channel inputs, e.g. using something like 'green=red+.5'? It won't work as a channel shifter, it simply results in 'use the same colormap for the red channel as for the green channel, except add .5 brightness to it aswell'.<br><br>(*) I suggest CMa for color map, CMo for color modifier ;).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">justin</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th September 2003 16:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">That's right, it just creates three tables in one pass, each table a remap for each channel. The reason you can't do full channel mixing is that the table that you would need to generate for that would be rather large.<br><br>Now, you could do it with reduced precision and interpolation, but I'm not sure that would be terribly useful.<br><br>Anyway, so yeah it just goes through the loop, each time setting<br>red, green, and blue from 0.0 to 1.0. Then you can modify what<br>the output for each of those channels are.<br><br>So you think we should rename it to Channel Modifier or Color Map<br>or something?<br><br>-Justin</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th September 2003 16:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hm? You don't seem to know this... Color Map already exists, it's an APE I made with similar functionality to Color Modifier, except it's not code driven, and uses only one index for lookup. <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2459801/" target="_blank">Get it here</a>.<br><br>Have you missed out on other APE goodies too, like Texer, Convolution (by Tom Holden), Multiplier, Channel Shift, ... ?

      </blockquote>Hmm, haven't tested this myself, but what about if you save the variables first? like:<br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>rgb=(red+green+blue)/3 ;<br>red=rgb ;<br>green=rgb ;<br>blue=rgb<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Would that create a grayscale image?

      <p class="post-content">No.<br>
      <br>
      As explained above Cmod consists of 3 seperate maps for each channel. Therefore you can't mix colours with it.</p>
