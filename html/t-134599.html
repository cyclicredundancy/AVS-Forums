      <br />
      i also have a couple objections...first is magic's entry, using the tentacles ape...i have a serious objection to anyone using that render in any preset in the first place, and imo it breaks the "only general apes" rule because it was made for one specific preset in the first place :/<br />
      <br />
      also, raz's entry - it's smooth, and it looks really cool, but it's not flow-y to me :)<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; forgot to ask: you say we can have unlimited buffer saves in rule #4, but that we can't have any buffer saves in #7... &lt;/edit&gt;</p>

      Here's my entry... though I'm not sure it qualifies. It's not a literal DM-kind of preset, but it still has a flowy feel.<br />
      <br />
      So it's up to the judges, whoever that turns out to be, to accept or reject it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">okay, another update of fingerpaint, plus a second entry - it's legal if the render rule is "two renders limited to one superscope" and not "one superscope, one other render"... :confused:<br />
      And I said I did some major cheating in the comment...what i meant is, all of the components are legal, but the way I used them bends the rules :)<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; oh dearie me, forgot to delete a stray superscope...also darkened it a little &lt;/edit&gt;<br />

      <blockquote>
        5: <b>two trans effects</b>(General APE's allowed,like color map,texer,convolution filter,but no preset specific APEs)
      </blockquote>now, if you're saying that the dm counts as one of those two trans effects, then you're going to need to restate those rules, cos they're kind of fucked up.<br />
      <br />
      also, another update...brightened it a little :p &lt;/edit&gt;

      <p class="post-content">One preset per person atero, this is a competition is case you forgot. So resubmit the one that you like best, and fix up your 'rule stretching'<br />
      <br />
      Maybe some of those rules do contradict, but if you use your noggin, i think you can work out what is meant by them for yourself. If you chose to re-interpret the rules after everyone else has abided by them, it isnt fair on the rest of 'em.<br />
      <br />
      Here is a very slight update of mine, with the color map enhanced a bit.<br />

      <p class="post-content">If dynamic movement counts in the "2 trans effects" section, then my preset as well violates rules.<br />
      <br />
      But why, oh why is there an unlimited use of effect lists? Effect lists are fps sucking monsters! They slow any preset down too much... Wasn't the original idea to make <i>fast</i>(in fps) presets?</p>

      <p class="post-content">This was *exactly* why I objected to the competition in the first place, siddhartha_one. If you're going to be that anal retentive about this contest, then I'm out of it entirely. I followed your fucking rules as best as I could, I asked for a restatement, and all you could do is call me an idiot and stalk off. Well guess what, YOUR RULES ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND, MMKAY? Tell us what the hell we're supposed to do or FUCK OFF.<br />
      As for multiple entries, the few contests I've seen around ALL allowed more than one preset per person, so don't give me that "This is a contest, after all" crap :mad:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey, im not being anal, nor did i make up the rules. I think phaze did that. I didnt call you an idiot, and i didnt 'stalk off'<br />
      Im just trying to make sence of it so that everyone is at the same level.<br />
      chill atero.<br />
      <br />
      Here is a new verion of phazes the rules. they arnt changed, just made more clear. sorry if i pissed you off, no intention to do so.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      1: 1 dynamic movement.<br />
      2: two other trans.<br />
      (this means you can have 1 dm and 2 others. 3 all up.)<br />
      <br />
      3: 1 superscope.<br />
      4: one other render.<br />
      (this means you can have 1 ssc and 1 other. 2 all up.)<br />
      <br />
      5: any ammount of fadeout, brightness, fast brightness, effect list or /misc section.<br />
      6: you CANT replace your DM for another trans, or your ssc for another render.<br />
      7: In general, presets should 'flow', and be reasonably fast in fps.<br />
      <br />
      any other queries, post to the OTHER thread. (just about a lost cause now.)</p>
