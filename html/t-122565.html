      Look what I found on deviant art today:<br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        Today, the division of Microsoft Corporation responsible for their latest media player, Windows Media Player 9 Series (WMP9), have lauched WMPlugins - "The place to find and share plug-ins, skins, and visualizations to enhance your Windows Media experience."<br />
        <br />
        This website is a repository of everything related to WMP9, from hosting plug-in's and skins to a service that professionally tests your creations. As all Microsoft territories, WMPlugins supports Microsoft Passport, allowing you to give ratings to the plug-ins you try. As an incentive for participating , the site mentions: "Top raters will get extra perks from time to time — maybe even prizes like portable music players."<br />
        <br />
        For plug-in developers, you currently have the ability to submit your creations in one of two ways:<br />
        <br />
        Via Veritest — "Veritest, a WMPlugins.com partner, will test your plug-ins and submit them directly into the catalog at a low cost. Veritested plug-ins get priority in search results."<br />
        <br />
        Via WMPlugins.com — "Of course you can submit your plug-ins, skins, and visualizations through our site here. Our team is limited, but we'll review your enhancement and post it."<br />
        In addition to providing eyecandy for casual browsers and modders, services for developers, WMPlugins also provides resources for aspiring developers. Those wanting to develop goodies for Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 Series can consume all of the resources provided in the "Developers Resources" section, as well as from any of the listed community sites on similar subjects.
      </blockquote>The presets are actually all done with C++ and GDI functions as a COM. This looks like it might be nice, but then again it is made by Microsoft.:p What do you think about this?

      <p class="post-content">LOL, yeah I thought the same thing, but it looks like it might have some promise. At least with it, only people who know how to program some will be able to post presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">hey, once someone codes Marbles, Flowers of Funk, Chroma Cloud, Starlight Aurora, Smear (which IMHO is oh so much better than Geiss ever was), Chaos Wave (probably simple as hell but I'd like to see it), Cosmic Nebulae (same thing), Surreal Potential Fields (ahem...same thing), SoniquePlas (not available on Sonique's website), Light Magick, Pulse (not available on Sonique's site either), The Rabbit Hole (this might've been done, but I'm not sure), Jazz, Space Thing, Phase, Ghost Wheel (again, probably fairly simple), Cosmic Belt, Faited, Voronoi, Groofed Up, and - of course - Miffo, THEN AND ONLY THEN are you allowed to dis Sonique visuals.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Im not dissing sonique presets or even wmp visualizations, but im dissing the fact that i would have to hard code them (and i don't know how to code anything at all). Since avs gives me an easy way to do visualizations, why should i bother to learn C++, assembly, or whatnots...</p>

      <p class="post-content">What a bunch of 'tasteless' tight arse fks microsoft are - don't they have enough money to actually PAY for people to develop this shit?. Seeing as they collect usage data from WMP which is sold to music companies, and that WMP will eventually be covered in adverts. I mean - wow - giving someone a portable mp3 player for something thats taken them a hundred hours to get working and is going to make them a fair quid because that software will attract more users to their shitty product. Puke. Binge. HURL!!! THE LEAST they could do is develop an AVS type interface - that AT LEAST could be developed to adapt to the latest technology and make the software more powerful.<br />
      Im not saying thats a good thing by the way. Imagine how buggy and fked up it would be anyway!!</p>

      Microsoft is too cheap to pay people to develop presets. I never use WMP and I never plan to.</p>

      <p class="post-content">1.) Nullsoft, not winamp.<br />
      <br />
      2.) Nullsoft aren't claiming winamp plugins as their own, in fact just letting people claim that an AVS preset is their own visualization is a pretty good gesture. Whereas M$ will brand 'Microsoft' on anything that barely references them.</p>
