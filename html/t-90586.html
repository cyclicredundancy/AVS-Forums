      I'm kind of new at this, don't know all the math and stuff... just made these by combining different effects and filters. Used the water effect a lot. They run pretty slow if you make them bigger than about a playing card on my computer, but that could just be my 4-year-old computer's fault :) So: are these any good? Boring? Awful? Let me know :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Disco over the water was very nice.<br />
      <br />
      mysticaltimespaceportalwithtext was kind of cool also, but I'd personally like to see a little more color in it.<br />
      <br />
      Rainbow nebulae was very good also.<br />
      <br />
      Some of your presets look very similar to some presets that have already been published-so we tend to think of those as boring presets.<br />
      <br />
      The three presets that I mentioned I was quite impressed with.<br />
      <br />
      :) Feel free to download &amp; rate some of my presets using the links in my signature :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for your review :) I made a more colorful mystical spacetime portal thingy, just for fun. It was kind of hard to get it to be colorful but not too much. As I said, I'm kind of new, so I'm not always sure what's been done before and what hasn't, so thanks for letting me know what looks originalish. And I'll take a look at your presets when I get the chance *still trying to figure out which version to download and feeling a little intimdated by all the math*<br />
      <br />
      By the way, how are the speed on these things on other people's computers? About average? Too slow?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hokay, here goes.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">individual</font><br />
      <font color="blue">rainbow nebula journey 3</font> - Replacing the first effect list with a clearscreen set to 50/50 blend will do exactly the same thing. It got me 3 more fps. You have a unique tone in there that's doing nothing. I personally like not having extra things in my presets.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">mystical timespace portal with text</font> - Whew, what a name. If you have stuff before an effect list where the input is ignored, it does nothing. Iremoved the blur and got a jump of around 3 fps. You could also get away with a replace on the brightness instead of a blend. It's faster because it doesn't have to blend. It gave me another fps.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">zoomy nebula 2</font> - I though it was a little unbalanced, so I added another small oscilicope star on the other side.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">psycho nebula 2</font> - Liked the zoomy one better.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">diso over the water</font> - I never really liked the "psychothic beaming ******d" movement much.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">swimming ink blot</font> - Nice and simple. I kinda liked it.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="blue">firey rainbow portal</font> - I think I liked mystical timespace better.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">overall</font><br />
      - Your presets have a nice soft look that I tend not to see in newbie persets. Nice.<br />
      - The speed was pretty much fine on my computer. (watch those blurs though)<br />
      - Most prestes were fairly simple, but you gotta start somewhere eh? ;) Some of the ones in my pack were pretty simple too.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Good job overall. Keep it up.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>fullscreen fps</strong><br />
      I have a fairly old computer, but at fullscreen 640/480 @ 32 BPP, I get about 13 fps for that preset.<br />
      <br />
      --edit--About your question about the speed of your presets compared to other presets. Many of my presets were designed to have a high fps, but a lot of people want to try to see whether AVS can do _________ or ________ (like UnConeD's cool 3-D stuff like the pyramid. So I've seen ones that are much slower &amp; I've seen ones much faster.<br />
      <br />
      One example of a fast preset (fast IMO) is my one called color blobulae mind beaters. It's in one of the zip files in my thread available in the link in my sig called AVS Preview Pack. I'm not sure what zip file, but the last time that preset was saved was May 13th, if that's any help.<br />
