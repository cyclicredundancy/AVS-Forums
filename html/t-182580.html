      <p class="post-content"><strong>Doppler Effect</strong><br />
      Doppler Effect, in physics, the apparent variation in frequency of any emitted wave, such as a wave of light or sound, as the source of the wave approaches or moves away from an observer. The effect takes its name from the Austrian physicist Christian Johann Doppler, who first stated the physical principle in 1842. Doppler's principle explains why, if a source of sound of a constant pitch is moving towards an observer, the sound seems higher in pitch, whereas if the source is moving away it seems lower. This change in pitch can be heard by an observer listening to the whistle of an express train from a station platform or another train. The lines in the spectrum of a luminous body such as a star are similarly shifted towards the violet if the distance between the star and the Earth is decreasing and towards the red if the distance is increasing. By measuring this shift, can we add the relative motion of the AVS and the values can be calculated?<br />
      <br />
      I mean this effect is revolution for AVS, if we use this method to AVS in next release.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Shabaviz... what's the point of your post? Really? Aside from the fact that anyone worth his brains should know what the doppler effect is, you could've just posted a link to a wikipedia article or something instead of posting that blurb.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, AVS can only have a read-only effect on sound, so an audio-doppler effect is out of the question.<br />
      As far as doppler colorshifts are concerned, those happen only at extreme velocities and in very, very small quantities (i.e. not noticable with our eyes).<br />

      Try posting concrete, useful messages with actual content next time you decide to ignore your ban. Think about what you want to say and decide for yourself if others would care about it.</p>

      I suggest others ignore him aswell in the future, because as long as he has audience he is going to come back again and again and again and again...</p>

      <p class="post-content">But you'd have to recognize him first though then. How about not banning him next time so we know who he is? It wouldn't really help otherwise. Or is that just a bad idea?<br />

      <p class="post-content">The point is, he is evading his ban by re-registering, which is not allowed. If you are banned and wish to come back, you should have the brains not to stand out so much.<br />
      <br />
      It's not as if we aggressively hunt for IPs matching shabaviz' previous ones: it's just that whenever someone posts something like this thread, I check if it could be shabbie. And it was ;).</p>

      <p class="post-content">To me, he clearly enjoys the attention given - even by this post - so he will most likely keep re-registrating.<br />
      How could you stop him then? At least now we know it's him.<br />
      If there were an IP-check or so before registrating it'd be a powerful tool in these situations.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, but keep in mind that it could cause problems for people in the same IP range (i.e. at the same college). Plus, it is easy to just use a proxy server to evade this.</p>
