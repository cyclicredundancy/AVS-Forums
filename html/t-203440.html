      <p class="post-content"><strong>Flame MaTTFURY Preset Pack Take II</strong><br />
      Ok, here's the deal. If you have made a flame preset dedicated to MaTTFURYS super-ability to get flammed. Post it here so it can be included in the official pack. I know people have posted them before in the other thread, but i'm taking into account that people have created other presets or updated the ones they have already made.<br />
      <br />
      So here are the terms:<br />
      <br />
      <b>1: By posting a preset in this thread you give me permission to add it to the pack and submit it under my name.<br />
      <br />
      2: All original comments and preset names will be unaltered so name your preset in the regular way "authour - preset name" and make sure you put in a decent comment with the heading "Flame MaTTFURY Preset Pack".<br />
      <br />
      3: Only presets posted in this NEXT WEEK will be added. So make sure you have them posted before the 6th of January 2005.</b><br />
      <br />
      If you don't agree with that <b>DON'T POST YOUR PRESET HERE</b>.<br />
      <br />
      If you do, post your preset here and i'll compile them all together and post in on dA with a link.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Right, I'm taking control, because no else will. You have till Sunday morning 11.00 am GMT to submit or modify any presets (all previous presets will be included). I will then make the installer, including all presets, spalash screen etc. Then matt will submit it.<br />
      <br />
      Why matt? The reason the first (or second) one was removed was because it was flaming against him, but although you may think it's possible DA won't remove it because he is flaming himself.<br />
      <br />
      Also, if you haven't made a preset yet MAKE ONE. You must have an hour between now and sunday free, so just do the bnest you can in the time you have, all of you.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If Matt is submiting it, count me out. I don't want my preset to be included in a matt pack.<br />
      <br />
      So just to make it absolutly clear:<br />

      <p class="post-content">wow, such a trouble!<br />
      <br />
      What about letting this pack be for good? let it be as it is..<br />
      <br />
      It was a big joke when the idea was new and when every day someone submitted a new mattfury-flame-preset.<br />
      <br />
      But now the whole thing is a real mess and not funny anymore (in my eyes). The one who had our permission to compile the presets finally made the pack: Thank you Mr.Nudge for that!<br />
      <br />
      But why should mattfury deserve that much attention? Is it because he just recently got unbanned? Or because he's such a great avs-artist?<br />
      Hey, he just WANTS that much attention, with all those discussions we only do what he wants us to do: putting him in the centre of attention.<br />
      <br />
      So, i agree with tug: my preset can be released with mr_nudge's pack (the one posted above in this thread). But in no other pack with wich furry matt has to do with.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What 'pack'?<br />
      <br />
      there are only 7 presets now, with tugg's one out 6<br />
      <br />
      That's not a pack!<br />
      <br />
      The filesize of all our posts on this subject is like a hundredfold of the filesize of the presets<br />
      <br />
      /offtopic: I guess with the ways things are going here as an example, a 'communitypack' is out of the question... :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">/offtopic too: no i think something like a communitypack is a good idea, as long as there would be a "miniumum requirement" in style. What about a pack with a special theme or so?</p>

      <p class="post-content">ok people, i'm going back to my proper house with my proper compy and pimpbot at the end of this week. So if matt has made a preset to be included in the pack, post it here, i'll recompile the pack as an installer, and if matt would be so kind as to write a little thing stating that he doesn't find it offensive (in his dA journal would be good so i can link to it), i'll resubmit it on dA and all should be good and well. So wait a week, and it should be up again.</p>
