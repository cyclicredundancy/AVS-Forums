      Visualisations are visualisations, christianitiy is christianitiy. The two are completely different things. I dont think people make avs with any particular message, its just pretty pictures that go with tha music.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I don't agree with you guys. I think presest can be religious. You can be very creative with all kind of religious symbols. In a texered or pictured preset, or by scoping (or DM-ing) them yourself. Though indeed it would require the use of those symbols.</p>

      </blockquote>Well if technicality is your strong point and you wish to pick at such exact's, then i would say a Christian AVS, would be something relating in anyway to the religion or the faculty's associated with it! I mean how would you want to define it?<br />
      <br />
      BTW, thanks for the helpful replies and its great to see the humongous amount of talent present here, some guys are absolute geniuses with code and make the most awesome visualization's!<br />
      <br />
      Any definition of christian AVS's are welcome and i will gladly d/l it if you feel it fits ur definition and then i will decide for myself!<br />
      <br />
      Once again THANKS;)

      <p class="post-content">well, Lord of the Rings has many religious themes to it, though I wouldn't compare it directly in every aspect to Christianity. I made a preset Sauron's Fiery Eye, search AVS forums.<br />

      Well it isn't strictly winamp, but I thought it might be of interest to you...I did a re-do of 50 Cent's In da Club<br />

      Note this recording isn't perfect, has some blips etc. &amp; cuts off too early, though the perfect version I have on my studio. <a href="http://e.1asphost.com/sharkdarapper/50_Cent_12-20_attempt_2.ogg" target="_blank">http://e.1asphost.com/sharkdarapper/..._attempt_2.ogg</a><br />

      I'm in the process of (slowly) re-doing my site based on suggestions from the forums (like replacing the spaces in the file names with underscores, etc.) It works fine with IE 6.____ (whatever)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Christian AVS... hmm... makes one wonder, what does make one a christian visualization? If we are now sticking to avs (after all this is the AVS forums ;)) what about the comments that people include within a preset? Can something that a author said in the comment make a preset non-accetable for christians? I don't know about others, but i talk, i talk so much i can't even remember half of it :D But also when i write comments im not thinking wheter or not this or that kind of people would find it offending... So could a bad comment spoil a good preset is what im basicly asking :)<br />
      <br />
      Also, the whole thought of a christian avs is kinda... well, how does one say it, very much subtle concept. Is it the title of the preset that makes it? What the presets shows for you in the screen? Or does ones words count for anything?<br />
      <br />
      All i can say, that avs that is directed to any certain group of people by religion / politics / country is a very very rare sight around here, the community. One might be touchy by discussing about them, but most of us are pretty neutral i guess. We just do avs that we like, very very rarely it has any kind of a point or message behind it :)</p>

      And for defining christian presets, a lot of presets are just.. visualizations (funny, heh?), others are created to look like something and can be christianity-themed. Can Vis-presets be christian? I wonder...</p>

      Yes i think it's irrelevant too, but im just curious could a good preset be ignored just by it's title or comment? Maybe im wrong (or generalizing), but to me it seems that a preset named "Multiple Orgasms" doesn't get much of audience from christians... :p</p>

      <br />
      Anyway, I don't think anything without the ability to invent a god can be christian. AVS presets probably don't have souls/minds, whether or not souls/minds exist.

      I really can't even guess where in the worlds name you come up with that thought! Computers or computer generated/produced 'stuff' has a soul? (you talked only about avs presets, maybe you think Windows OS's have a soul... which is a rather frightening thought...)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, when things get into talking about does AI have a soul, it's better to stop :)

      <br />
      When I say soul/mind what I mean is: has a dualism, as in mind &amp; body, rather than <i>simply</i> body.<br />
      <br />
      In Douglas Coupland's novel 'Microserfs' one of the characters builds a 'soul' database for his notebook.<br />
      <br />
      The idea isn't that farfetched. If we are simply material beings--in other words, having mind and body exist as one entity, rather than a dualism--then AI would have all of the same faculties as humans possibly even better ones. Have you ever seen 'Bladerunner' or even that crappy movie 'AI'?<br />
      <br />
      For the purposes of this, read mind as subjectivity and body as objectivity. I don't mean brain when I say mind, unless I am talking about materialism.<br />
      <br />
      If we exist with seperate mind/soul and body then there is no locus for subjectivity, so how will AI have a subjective viewpoint without it being put there by a human? And exactly where is it 'put'? There is no location for the 'mind'. So does it spontaneously form in an conceptual reality at the conception of subjectivity?<br />
      <br />
      AI uses heuristics, which in turn come from thought and sensory data, and thought comes from the mind/brain. Either way it's subjective. And if you're the kind who believe in souls you shouldn't exclude the possibility of AI having a soul, after all quantum physics seems to suggest that it's more than probable, seeing how our world is really an interaction and interpretation of ourselves.<br />
      <br />
      Other literature and movies that ponder the question of AI and souls:<br />
      <br />
      Pinnochio<br />
      2001: A space oddessey<br />
      Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?<br />
      Supernova<br />
      <br />
      That's just off the top of my head. C'mon, like this really came out of far left field. It's been a pretty common thought for quite a while.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Deamon: you're right, sort of. Santa Claus is 'de kerstman' and Sinterklaas is the other dude. But they are simply two different versions of the same story/myth... you never wondered why they both wear red and a funny hat, and deliver gifts through the chimney?<br />
      Sure, the details vary a bit, but the main idea is still the same.</p>
