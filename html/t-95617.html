Many newbies haven't developed a real...taste yet. Of course as newbies get more practice in AVS, they get better.<br><br>This is no exception to you...but I believe it's a better thing in your case, because you're developing the taste I mentioned earlier quite quickly.<br><br>This will give you a bigger appetite for more complicated, better-looking presets! This motivation might make it so you advance in your AVS skills quite quickly.<br><br>Now...on to the presets. Part of the reason I said you were developing a taste that will lead you to explore &amp; get better in AVS quickly is your choice in trying to make flames in a preset. I'd done what I consider a lot of experimentation trying to get a preset that resembled Sauron's eye (see my LOTR hyperlink in my sig). I've improved it...but I might find a way to make it look more realistic. (I'm okay the current result, but I'm not satisfied in its realism yet). Look at the intro preset to UnConeD's Whacko AVS Pack II. I did a remix to it...but it's a different kind of flames.<br><br>I've discovered that making "good" flames is quite difficult to get in certain circumstances...but in others, it's not so bad!<br><br>I was fairly impressed with your overall understanding of how the different things in AVS work with each other in your gate 2 hell preset. The combinations of things you added created what I considered a decent outline of the shape of flames. (quite impressive to see this from a newbie) I remixed it slightly with something I've found helped my Sauron's Fiery Eye.3 preset...two roto blitters or blitter feedbacks that almost balance each other out...but not quite. You'll see what I mean. It's just a remix I threw together quite quickly, so I'm sure you can improve it a lot.<br><br>I was impressed with your globe. Did you really make that on your own?<br><br>Now try to make other shapes...and work with the color combinations assigned in superscopes (RGB values). You will impress yourself with the color capabilities of superscopes<br><br>I slightly remixed your tunnel preset. I don't think it's very weird...I like that sort of stuff. One thing I like to do is to make it to where the one superscope has a different number of colors than the other...so there will be more of a changing pattern---see example below<br><br>If one superscope has 5 colors, and the 2nd one has 6-notice the pattern:<br><br>1st SSC: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5<br>2nd SSC: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1<br><br>I like the pattern to fluctuate a little more...but yours was quite nice.<br><br>Best wishes that AVS will continue to surprise you &amp; that you will surprise yourself with your experimentation in AVS. Always be thinking of other ways you might do something. Write down your ideas &amp; keep them somewhere. You may not be able to do them now with the math you know, but it's good to have a "to-do" list of presets you want to make as you gain more advanced math capabilities.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaheckelsafar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd August 2002 07:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I did like that ball one.<br><br>Tunnel wasn't bad, but there wasn't enough going on for me. Perhaps make the movements into a DM that changes just enough to mess with 'ya. :)<br><br>I think I've seen a few to many presets like gate to hell.
