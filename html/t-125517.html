      We organized a wonderfull Goa Party last WE<br />
      I thought i'm gonna post the pictures of my AVS-Projections here so you can all see 'em. :D<br />

      <br />
      We had a 2400 Ansi Lumen Beamer, so it was quite impressive.<br />

      <p class="post-content">No, i havn't puplished any packs.<br />
      <br />
      The thing is, as i do VJing with a Freeware Programm, i kept most of my works to myself to prevent someone copying my set, which could easily be done if i published My Presets and my selfmade VJ-program.<br />
      <br />
      I dont know, maybe it's a Childish way to think about it, but i've seen many guys playing randomly downloaded stuff from UnConeD and others and they keep calling themselves VJ's. :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      I would never dare to use someone elses Presets anyway. :o<br />
      <br />
      Let's see, i'm gonna check my Stuff and make a Pack, lets say about 20 Presets for the Community in the Forums, i dont think any of you is gonna abuse it. :D<br />

As long as we get some recognition and it isn't passed off as your own, we would love to have you show our stuff.

      </blockquote>No, that's not the point. Of course everyone <b>should</b> use published presets. But as i see it, this should be <b>not</b> the case when you want to do VJing with them (unless you give credits to the author which nearly no VJ does :mad: ).<br />
      <br />
      Example: Legohead (sorry i had to use someone) downloads a load of presets, takes is PC to a Party turns it on, leans back and gets paid afterwards.<br />
      <br />
      I just think thats not fair because he has'nt even done a real VJing - and unfortunately most of the so called VJ's that i know work exactly this way.<br />
      <br />
      In my opinion, the set of Presets and the way you arrange them according to music has to be an unit.<br />
      <br />
      So you gotta know:<br />
      - Your set in detail (how the presets look like and behave)<br />
      - Your DJ's set and the music he plays to react properly<br />
      - Your tools (in my case AVS and Hotlist for VJing)<br />
      <br />
      So far for my Point of View. The Pack is still to come...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      @Anubis i alraedy knew that but the other case is that i try to differ from the other "VJ's" by using only my presets. But if the Day comes when i run out of ideas, i'll think back what you said... ;)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      @Phaze:<br />
      So you're coming the long way from Mordor just to party with us?Yeah! <a href="http://www.htwm.de/mkrause1/polymorph/forum/images/smiles/smile_joint.gif" target="_blank">http://www.htwm.de/mkrause1/polymorp...mile_joint.gif</a><br />

      </blockquote>Polymorph is a Forum from many Underground Websites in Leipzig (the city where i live). Most Members are crazy guys just like me. Btw, thats where i took the extraordinary smilies from that i use.

      So and now, as promised, my (very first!) AVS-Pack release<br />
      <br />
      After all 40 Presets of my best Stuff.<br />
      Unfortunately i couldnt add my latest ones (forgot them at home) and i also had to leave out some very cool ones because they use very large avi's and bmp's. Nevertheless it' pretty good for a first Pack :D<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">We've had a few discussions about it, and almost everyone agreed that if you show their presets at a party, they'd love you for it.<br />
      <br />
      Most preset authors aren't VJ's and don't have powerful beamers, so more exposure is better :).<br />
      <br />
      Last big party I was at used some sort of Geiss/Milkdrop clone (I don't think it was Milkdrop itself, I didn't recognize any presets), Wildtangent dancing babes, video-loop and a live feed of the audience.<br />
      <br />
      I've also observed people's reactions to visuals at parties. While Wildtangent visualisers usually capture people's attention at first, they get boring quickly. After all, at a rave, there are dancing people everywhere, and usually wildtangent dancers are not in perfect sync anyway.</p>

      Have you already had a look at my Pack? Maybe you could propose some presets that would fit my Style... :)

      A VJ is the same - only visual. However if its one thing I've learn't - theres alot more to VJing than chucking on a few presets (like magic says).<br />
      <br />
      At the end of the day it has to have meaning, has to flow, has to take the viewer somewhere. A VJ has a hard job because he has to match the musics mood (which can be quite hard).<br />

      This weekend Im starting out with some OPENGL picture candy, then Im doing a kaleidascope set (using picture loader for more interesting textures) because its MUSHROOM season - and the crowds gonna go fkn sick at seeing morphing crazy shit.<br />
      Then I might do a completely different set when the morning DJ's come on and get into some psycadellic/dimensional stuff.<br />
      Making presets is one thing - making it work is an entirely different ball game.</p>

      </blockquote>Several DJ's have, as a matter of fact. Many will announce what song they are playing(at least sometimes). VJ'ing is a lot different, though, because a large population of people seeing them would assume that the VJ made them. Very, very few people would recognize AVS presets, and most don't know what AVS is. just a title AVS that you play at the beginning and end of the party that mentions those whose presets you are using. I have heard about instances of VJ's taking credit for presets that aren't theirs. As long as you don't do this I don't mind that much, but I would like to have recognition(not that you'd use any of mine).

      <p class="post-content">Thats fair. I wouldn't think much of a vj who 'assorts' other peoples work. Although I do use remixes which is ok (as defined by copyright I can modify content by 25% and it becomes my intellectual property - how do you quantify 25%..hmmmmm...).<br />
      <br />
      But then again, at the end of the day no-one really cares. VJ's are usually the unsung heros.</p>

      Magic.X: It's great projecting AVS presets on the wall, but you need to have a fast pc for high res. My school has got a p4 2ghz pc and I begged my principal to project some AVS prests for the Annual day before the actual entertainment programme, but she just wouldnt listen.<br />

      </blockquote>Well, you can do well with a middle class PC!<br />
      I'm using a 1 Ghz Athlon @ 400*300 res and it's fine because the Beamer does a lot of smoothing for you. :D

      <p class="post-content">You only need to output @ 800X600 - even on xga projectors it doesn't make too much difference (whos gonna notice). Upgrade your ram (higher fsb=more juice), close background apps, set thread priority to high, shrink screen hight to 80% (if all else fails), use pixel doubling and 32 bit colour modes. If you want that extra bit of speed reinstall windows and then install winamp first. 2ghz is plenty.<br />
      Most of my preset peak out at about 30fps now (anything above 24fps is pretty much seamless).</p>
