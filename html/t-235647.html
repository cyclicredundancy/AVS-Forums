      <p class="post-content">Hi betush22,<br />
      <br />
      - set up your LCD as a second screen (Extended desktop)<br />
      - best to make set it as small as possible (640x480, or maybe 800x400 if you're feeling confident)<br />
      - start winamp and AVS<br />
      - resize the AVS window to be as big as you've set your LCD screen<br />
      - drag it over so it completely covers your second screen<br />
      <br />
      Voila!<br />
      Don't forget to tell all your friend about AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Listen, I have a question that needs an answer and it would be great if i could get it soon. Can I download a plug in for winamp like AVS and be able to use it in Windows Media Center. Under My Music i can watch a visual but i can only use the ones that come with MP 10 and i know winamp is much better and would love to use it in Media Center. Thanks...</p>
