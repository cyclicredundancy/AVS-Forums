      I know that this has probably been asked a lot, but what math is needed for using the more advanced part of the AVS?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, depends what you want to do with AVS. The biggest things I can see are understanding polar coordinates, radians, and trigonometric functions. But there are a lot of different things you can do with AVS that take more advanced math, or you can work in rectangular if you don't understand polar. I still don't know what the heck a sigmoid is, but my presets look fine. So, it really depends on what you want to do. Remember, you don't need any math to start out if you're not writing custom movements or superscopes.<br />
      <br />
      Then again, there's nothing wrong with the "type random equations and see what happens approach." :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">Here you go:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code><br />                     1   <br />                 __________<br />sigmoid(x, a) =        -ax<br />                  1 + e<br /></code>

      <br />
      The function arises in differential math, but I'll spare you the gory details. You can view it as a constraining function which maps any value from (-infinity to +infinity) onto (0 to 1). As you can see from the definition, the parameter 'a' is simply a multiplication factor for the first parameter 'x'.

      I wasn't sure if it was any more than trigonometry. I'm luckiy that not only are we doing some of in in geometry, but I can do trig next year.</p>

      On secod thought, no. The teacher was just too boring. (sleeping during class does tend to have a detrimental affect on one's marks, though it did lead to the discovery of the pillow binder :) )</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm at High School now, believe me, you really don't learn that much math you can use for AVS's. It won't be much more than (x = x + 0.1 ). Easiest level of geometry is the best you get there. Still, it is a nice preparation on the better parts of required math.</p>

      <p class="post-content">light1986(nice name heheh) : it aint important what math you use but how much of it you understand...look at some basic coding,figure it out,do your own then take it to the next level. It`s not that hard you`ll see :)<br />
      <br />
      PS.I sleep at languages hour,at math the teacher is VERY MEAN and gives us small grades,hard tests and makes fun of us...:(</p>

      Daemon, you do learn some useful math at school if you take the right courses. Trig is very useful, and computer math/science courses also have some interesting things.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heres a list of the most useful math subjects I have found for AVS:<br />
      <br />
      Co-ordinate Geometry, Vectors, Matrices, Plane Geometry (In which I include Trigonometry), Solid Geometry, Calculus.<br />
      <br />
      A few of specific things from different areas that are useful are random numbers, linear/bilinear/trilinear/... interpolation, projective geometry, raytracing.<br />
      <br />
      Do some searches on the above using Google or something.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, I am a freshmen at AVS, and specialy Maths. I know the basic formulas like d=d+0.4, or x=cos(0.5)<br />
      But I just can not understand something like this:<br />
      d=log10(d*r-2+1/y*x/x+y)*sin(r*x+y/x*y+r)<br />
      I just can not believe how you can do it.<br />
      or, if someone, can tell my, how long<br />
      did I take for him, to understand all of the maths.<br />

      <blockquote>

      <br />
      Another thing:<br />

      <blockquote>
        Another semidead thread resurrected
      </blockquote>That should give you a hint, and yeah, I know where Slovenia is.<br />
      <br />
      There is no telling about how long it took, it comes with a piece at a time. Just start digging into some code that you think you might understand (try getting my Eye-Candy from my website (www-button)) this is still easy to understand.<br />
      Learn it and start fiddling around with your own imagination and you will grow day-by-day.
