2, etc..."</strong><br>Please forgive me if this is adressed somewhere else, I searched and couldn't find it.<br><br>If I am using a preset with "experimental" aspects to it to where you can switch from "auto" to "mouse 1" to "mouse 2" and like that (a prime example is S_KuPeRS '25 - recovering from fate (the way things change) from the lp8 pack) if I am in fullscreen and I click on the screen to change which setting I am using, it goes back to windowed mode, so basically I cant figure out how to switch from 'auto' to 'mouse 1' without going back and forth between fullscreen and windowed. Is there any way to fix this?<br><br>I fear I have made this question incredibly more complex than it needs to be; I was trying to be complete in my description. I hope someone can decipher it!:)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th February 2005 00:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">use keyboard keys</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">beeferoni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th February 2005 01:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Wow, I feel kind of stupid, as that is an obvious solution.

Okay.<br><br>We were talking about how you implent that support for your own presets (supposedly you would be making one), but since you aren't this whole thread became pretty pointless just about now :)<br><br>The thing is that "support" for such interactive features in fullscreen need to be <b>coded in</b> to the preset itself. There is no option on the preferences or the likes to magically turn it on, because the author of the preset has to make it so that you can use the features on fullscreen too. So it's up to the preset whether or not the features will work on fullscreen, but i still urge you to try out the rightclick on fullscreen, atleast all of my presets (the very few) which have interactive features should have rightclick support.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">beeferoni</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th February 2005 04:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Actually, rightclick doesn't do anything when I click in fullscreen, but I will play around with it.

You can sit and read maths textbooks for hours but you'll find hardly any of it can be directly applied to making AVS presets. Its better to think of what you want to do, then think about what maths (if any) is required to solve that problem.<br><br>In my opinion (and I stress this is just my opinion) programming prowess is much more important in AVS than maths, if you have a good grasp of the language you can implement what you see in your mind much more easily.
