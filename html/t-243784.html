      <p class="post-content">Post your presets in the AVS Presets board, like you did with that other .... preset.<br />
      <br />
      Not a bad use of the picture, and it looks like you managed to achieve what you wanted even with your limited skills (it's a bad preset to be honest, but I've seen far worse), which is commendable. However, you must do quite a bit better to get respect from people here.<br />
      <br />
      Starting every single word with a capital letter isn't interesting or cool, no matter what you think. Most people consider that annoying, also, try using proper English, ok. "Words" like "waddup", "mah", and "somphin", will just make you seem dumb to most people.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Now you seem to be obsessed with rips. There's no need to say everywhere that the preset isn't a rip.<br />
      <br />
      Now, let me tell you what a rip is, in case you didn't get it. Rips are presets that are blatant copies of preset (usually with only the colour changed), submitted with no reference to the original preset, under someone else's name. It doesn't even have to be an entire preset, it can be a copied Dynamic Movement, a copied Superscope etc., without crediting the original author.<br />
      <br />
      I could go on explaining more things, but I have no time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nothing really, but the kid seems to have done or less what he planned on doing, instead of a making a flashing or simply annoying run of the mill crap preset. It's still bad, but it's not as bad as some.</p>

      The thing that really bugged me on this preset was the comment:<br />
      <br />

      Cochise By Fentendo<br />
      In Fendervision<br />
      By Fentendo<br />
      Added Beat Text For The Hell Of It :P<br />
      <br />
      Small Glitch In Overlay On Left, Wanna Fix It?<br />
      You Can Edit It But Send Me Ur Verison So I Can Add Credits<br />
      --------------------------------------------------------<br />
      <br />
      to be more specific:<br />
      <br />
      <b>You Can Edit It But Send Me Ur Verison So I Can Add Credits</b><br />
      <br />
      Did you sent your preset to UnConed? It's like saying "don't steal" after you finished something big but when actually the whole thing is a stolen thing.

      <p class="post-content">Well it's geting better. Just a little pice of advice: usaly "text" is used in intros. maybe it's just me but it looks bad with those "texts" and it also drops the presets fps.<br />
      <br />
      I did a remix of your preset, I hope you don't mind. I got your fps up and I used a dm.</p>
