      Okay guys, some of you may remember me from about 2 or 3 months ago, when i posted my first visualization "PsychoticThumpin'"<br />
      I got the usual, it's okay, you're learning kind of responces...<br />
      <br />
      Well, i'm going to show you guys the fixed version of that first visualization, as well as a new visualization i made "PulsingSupernova"<br />
      <br />
      Please post your comments on both. However, i think i'm going to get better responces from PulsingSupernova.<br />
      <br />
      Note: On PulsingSupernova, feel free to change the colors of the moving particles to your person taste if you wish. I found it works real nice with any color really.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay---you asked for a review---so I'll give you one.<br />
      <br />
      I see you fixed the bugs in your original psychotic thumpin' preset. I personally liked the first one better, though. It seemed to me it had more appealing color combinations. My taste is simply that...my taste. I personally don't care if you laugh at my suggestions-because they're only suggestions. I think I would like the way it would look if you were to start from the 1st Psychotic Thumpin' &amp; then work from that to get the good color combinations. It's only a suggestion. :)<br />
      <br />
      The movement in PulsingSupernova was nifty, but it was a little too red for my taste. I'm not playing an arcade shooting game! Too much red! See what you can do to add a little more color.<br />
      <br />
      I remixed it slightly---it's just a quick change. I'm sure you can improve it greatly by experimenting adding different renders to get various color combinations.<br />
      <br />
      edit: just saw your comment about color combinations...still might try your hand at renders that have the capability of selecting several different colors to cycle through...that's a good way to get the varying patterns I like best. It works very well if you have a different number of colors on the different objects, because each cycle changes the pattern a little bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thx for the reply cmountford, you're commentary is always appreciated :)<br />
      <br />
      Yes, i see now that the thing does need more color, but i just really didn't liike the color combinations that the moving particles were giving me before. I pretty much stuck with red, because quite frankly, i'm a red and black kinda guy.<br />
      <br />
      Now again, you said i could improve greatly on your remix, and i did. :D Personally i thought your remix looked too much like an acid trip :) Of course though, i guess you didn't know exactly what i was thinking while making it. You might have noticed i slapped a moving particle straight in the center. I did that to remove any episodes of the preset becoming straight black. It also ended up giving the preset a dominant color to stick with. It was all i could think of at the time. When you made that particle green however.. and then have it pulse... It just kinda got in the way :(<br />
      <br />
      Well, i decided to go back to the object i used back in PsychoticThumpin' to fix this problem. You wanted more color? Those two Oscilliscope stars should do the trick. It won't look like a friggin rainbow though. :D And no more moving particles getting in the way. It also gives the preset a nice "electrical" look. You'll see what i mean...</p>
