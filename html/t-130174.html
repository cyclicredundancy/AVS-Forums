Try making something of your own from the ground up instead of just taking something already done and adding colors that don't follow any sort of pattern.<br><b>Wild Circle Havyx3</b> - Nothing special - at least throw a nice effect on it. All it is is some ssc's rotating on the surface of a sphere with some stars.<br><b>Magic of the geometry final</b> - Very weirdly moving ssc, that would be alright if you made the colors a little nicer and added a nice effect to it.<br><b>Vertical Audio Scanner</b> - Don't like. It's just a moving line with weird colors. Add effects to make it somewhat interesting.<br><b>Mind Out Of Limits</b> - SSC isn't terrific and the effect isn't much. Apparently I don't have the font that you have. If you want others to see it the same as you, you are going to have to package the font with the presets and create an NSIS installer that will install them.<br><b>Time to make a life</b> - Anyone here could tell you that I would absolutely abhor this preset. Moving Particles are very rarely used in a way that pleases me, and this is by far among the worst. The Dynamic shift is just the default one - nothing done to even make it better. Sorry, but I hate this preset.<br><b>Mind Out Of Limits 2</b> - Almost a decent preset. Try to use better colors, and add a more interesting effect - perhaps a DM.<br><b>Mind Pressure</b> - Needs better colors and a better effect.<br><b>Feel the box</b> - Synch the cubes and add a nice effect to it.<br><font color="red">Overall: 1.75</font>. You really need to choose better colors - a simple change from red to green to blue like that doesn't look that good and adds way too many colors with some of your ssc's. Also, learn how to code DM's - they will help you make much better effects. These presets aren't the normal n00b presets, but I wouldn't consider them to be better than some of the normal n00b presets. They are almost all based on the same SSC, and they aren't eyecapturing.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Pixelcraft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th March 2003 16:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Very good ssc's, but you need something in the background and some movement to <font color="orangered">ALL</font> of them.

Those scopes look weird and all the code doesn't seem to do much. It just seems to rotate a little circle of lines around 3d very slowly. Try changing x1, y1 and z1 to different things to get different results. eg for a sphere:<br><br>x1=sin((i*tpi*50))*(cos(i*pi+pi/2)*0.5);<br>y1=cos((i*tpi*50))*(cos(i*pi+pi/2)*0.5);<br>z1=cos(i*pi)*0.5;<br>(make sure you set the variables in the "init" box: "n=300; pi=acos(-1); tpi=pi*2;"<br><br>You've made (?) some 3d rotation and made crappy use out of it. Being able to code doesn't necessarily make good presets. You need to know how to make things look good.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">shape</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th April 2003 12:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">2Raz_001 thnx for you opinion! and i try for some more...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">shape</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th April 2003 13:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">result of Raz_001 help...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
