Why is implementing 3D acceleration into AVS so difficult? I have seen other visual plug-ins for Winamp that use the technology, not that Im downing AVS .... it kicks ASS, but it has a slow frame rate because it doesen't use the available resources of an everyday computer. Shouldn't this be looked at as a problem by the coders? I see alot in the news about skins and new skins for Winamp 3, but nothing about the coding of a new AVS thats gonna blow you away be cause it CAN use accelerated graphics.Is there any development and if so when can it be expected? Again, I am not putting the code down, its unreal, but it would be UNREAL if it could use REAL graphics.;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Scarface2k1</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th September 2001 03:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">because avs doesnt need it to be it (basically saying) you can have avs to look like its have 3d and GL, just u got to have the right presets that do ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">transfrmr</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th September 2001 06:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>True...</strong><br>I believe that right now the flaw is that most of the people making AVS presets (myself included) still don't completely understand the program itself. Therefore, we an't really optimise our work. There are people making insane presets that run pretty fast, but you're going to need a faster processor to watch them.<br><br>As for why it takes them so long.. Well, in case you didn't notice, it's freeware, and they have just had staff cuts at nullsoft as well. Plus they're workingon Winamp 3. I'm pretty sure they'll get around to updating AVS, an maybe even implementing some kind of 3d card usage, but hey, they have other stuff to do.<br><br>(hey, that may be way off base, but I'm pretty sure it's something along those lines)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">rarefluid</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th September 2001 04:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">3D graphics are possible with AVS.

And finaly he implant same fuction in new AVS that can be found only in WINAMP alpha l8r :) so it cannot be used with WINAMP 2.x until they did not release new version. But I still think there is a lot of things to improve for example thic scaling may be done automaticly dipends of speed of AVS so if diplay resolution is 800/600 and you want to run all AVS with 20FPS it may reduce render size dynamicly but stil display 800/600 using filtering like in overaly mode. But from this comes one other program most of AVS effect must be rewrited so size of element to be same nometer used resolution. For example now if you use SSC with Line width from "Set render mode" you only are ableto select size depending of pixel not from actual screen size. So if one SSC is 100 pixels width it will be take 33% (1/3) of screen if res. is 320/240 but if res. is 800/600 it will take only 12% (1/8) of screen. And this will couse not so similar look of AVS if render size is dynamicly changed based on speed.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tonic</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st September 2001 18:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: Yep.</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by transfrmr</i><br><b>If you want true proof that AVS 3D graphics at a decent framerate is possible, check out the EL-VIS plasma pack.

Just need to know AVS very well.<br>Histori of 3D avs.<br>1 - There is one 3D.APE that displeay some 3D objects from .ASC files. I do not know how to find program with which are made .ASC files and cannot find somone to help me. So there is near 7 .ASC files with different shapes like ANT,Cube,Sphere .... Check for "Tonic_Fatest_pack" (in WINAMP AVS presets page) for this 3D ape and all .ASK files<br><br>2 - Second way was with 3D surfaces that are made with normal Static Movement. Example is "x=x/(y+1)" that create izometric look.<br>there is a lot of other static 3D surfaces that can be produced like 3D room, 3D coridor, 3D tunel etc.. but code is more complicated<br><br>3 - Then when we have this 3D surface you may add and some 3D movement like X,Y shifting with (with DynShift) then with DynDist you can add and Z axis (with zooming)<br><br>4 - THen as you said El-Vis decide that SSC and be mede 3D with usage of some 3D transformacion. For such effect searc for "El_VIS" (in WINAMP AVS presets page) and DL 6 and 7 AVS packs from him<br><br>5 - Next step was when to AVS were added new effect called DynMove.<br>There is alot AVS artist that use DynMOve to create 3D look but best of them that use full feture of DynMove is UnConeD. Dl his presets from WINAMP AVS preset pasge by searching for "WHACKO" or just go to "TOP 10 AVS presets" page and you will see them. Also last El-vis 8th AVS Pack to heve good usage of 3D DynMovements<br><br>all info come from Tonic :)<br><br>PS: Some new 3D AVS and from me can be found here<br><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=78161" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=78161</a><br><br>some old from me and other can be found here:<br><a href="http://tonic.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://tonic.deviantart.com</a><br><a href="http://avsking.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://avsking.deviantart.com</a><br><a href="http://el-vionic.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://el-vionic.deviantart.com</a><br><a href="http://nemoorange.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://nemoorange.deviantart.com</a></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">transfrmr</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">22nd September 2001 01:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>:)</strong><br>Thanks Tonic..<br><br>I have all of EL-VIS and Unconed's packs, they are sublime.

Using the lightning fast blitter in your card is a lot faster than using your cpu. The dynamicmovement for example can be done using a 3D card (the plug-in Milkdrop does it). The superscope as well (if your 3D card has dedicated and fast line drawing features).<br><br>The reason it doesn't work well for AVS is because all the rest is done by the CPU, so you'd need to copy the image to the card, process it, and bring it back to the CPU for more processing. In this case letting the CPU do it is faster I believe.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
