A lot of your presets resemble each other in a number of ways. A good number of yours are very similar to ones we made as newbies too. That isn't a bad thing---it's just room for improvement.<br><br>The psychotic beaming ******d movement limits the variety of your presets greatly. Let me explain: Say you created a preset that is very nice, and you're quite happy with the effect it's creating. Now you want to add a movement. You are deciding which kind, and let's pretend you pck the psychotic beaming ******d. Uh oh! The cool effect is replaced entirely by psychotic beams shooting ******d! And your original cool effect can't be seen. That's why psychotic beaming ******d has its limits.<br><br>I actually kind of liked the effect in 70's dance party.<br><br>Dark hole was one of your better presets. You used starfields effectively in that preset---but you seem to overuse this render in several other presets. Nice combination of effects in this preset.<br><br>Dizcoball gave me quite a surprise---nice effect at the beginning. Could use a little more color, though. I'd like it a lot more if you had slightly smaller squares &amp; more colors in the dot fountains. It will probably lose some of the original effect, however.<br><br>Forest fury was one of your better-designed presets. Not very visually appealing IMHO. A little work &amp; it could become what I hope you think is a nice preset.<br><br>Try adding some movements to Hellfire. Or try tinkering around with a Roto Blitter. You know hellfire is a type of missile that the Apache helicopters used in Operation Desert Storm?<br><br>I believe that Living Fractal looks better with the Mosaic on 50/50 blend. But hey---that's just my opinion---your opinion is much more important.<br><br>Marti Gras had a nice movement in it. That preset has some real potential. Try tinkering around with it some more &amp; adding different types of renders, etc.<br><br>"Psychodelic" was another fairly nice but simple one.<br><br>I think Riding the Nebula would be much nicer with a little more color variety.<br><br>I really liked Unnamed. It was (IMO) currently the best-looking preset in the pack. That doesn't mean it's the best-designed one. With some work, some of your other ones could become better than this one<br><br>Hope my reviews weren't too harsh :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th August 2002 16:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yes, I'm somewhat new to AVS, but I'm also somewhat old...<br><br>I was wanting more of a lazer-like show from the center of the ring in "Ode to Tempest" and the such...remember that game?<br><br>Thanks for the comment on 70's dance party...It wasn't exactly what I liked in a preset, but hey if people like it, Ride with it!<br><br>Darkhole was one of my latest uses of the Starfield...The others don't look good to this one.<br><br>Let me ask you this: When have you ever seen a disco ball with colors? That's kind of the effect I was looking for. Smaller squares doesn't make it look nice...<br><br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Forest Fury looks like something that comes out of a bull, but you say it can be better?<br><br>What I wanted with Hellstorm was more of a planetary or a star-like feel...<br><br>Have you ever seen a Fractal being processed? That's the effect I was looking for. If you don't just look around online and you may find Fractal proggies for free.<br><br>Marti Gras wasn't exactly what it was cracked up to be...<br><br>I guess I could add a few more pinks and purples and other colors to "Riding the Nebula"...<br><br><br>Just a note: all of my presets are opensource. If you feel they'd look better a certain way, REMIX THEM! I could care less.<br><br>Btw, speaking of simplistic, here's a preset from Winamp2 that was simple that looks pretty good.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th August 2002 02:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Brand New Remix of Riding the Nebula, I present Riding the Nebula ReMix2</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th August 2002 17:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Bonus presets...<br><br>Spacetravel-Nebula Remix<br>Not Bad-Matrix REMix<br>Kalediskope<br><br>Not bad was made by Tonest@r and I remixed it...Enjoy!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th August 2002 23:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Another one...</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
