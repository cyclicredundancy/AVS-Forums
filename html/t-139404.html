      <p class="post-content">Looks like everyone is avoiding to write a review ;) I guess I'll give in.<br />
      <br />
      Ok, I can't believe I'm doing this, but here goes.<br />
      <br />
      Intro - Very cool movements. The background looks a bit n00bish, but not in a bad way. :)<br />
      <br />
      Kaleido Fun - Kinda slow, one of those presets that makes you say "come on come on come on hurry up and get good!" other than that it's cool.<br />
      <br />
      Odour Control - Don't really like the colors (gray and yellow?!? Good God man, what were you thinking???) but it's ok.<br />
      <br />
      MTV3 Summer - Neat, but kinda boring. Still good though.<br />
      <br />
      Under Sea Path - Now THIS is cool. Landscape presets are usually a little crude, but you've made a nice, smooth, happy colored preset. Sort of like a Disney movie!:p<br />
      <br />
      Rust Spectrum - I dig every thing about this preset! Good Job!<br />
      <br />
      Piknik - Boring. Not your best work, but I guess everyone gets a little stuck sometimes.<br />
      <br />
      Lego Blocks - Weirdass but cool DM. I can see you as 5 years old playing with legos building a lego computer or something:p<br />
      <br />
      Digital Candy - Nice Colors, but I don't like the mosaic touch very much.:(<br />
      <br />
      Different Load - Sweet! Like a transluscent Death Star!<br />
      <br />
      Weird Milks - Nice, but "milk?" Kind of......:igor:<br />
      <br />
      Worm O Rama - The first time I saw this preset I watched it for 10 minutes straight.....so many lines intersecting constantly.....than I looked off the screen and I saw everything in my house intersecting constantly.....it just proves you really don't need pot for trippin' :D<br />
      <br />
      Molecule Blobs - (Scmptgk.) I wasn't gonna say anything.<br />
      <br />
      Winamp Vis - Nice visualduplication! You did good on the scopes.<br />
      <br />
      Orb of Destruction - Very cool.<br />
      <br />
      Weird Blob - Weird. It's a bit boring, sorry.<br />
      <br />
      Shiny metal curves - The name excited me! :igor: Very Nice.<br />
      <br />
      Audio Candy - Nice flowy fading background.<br />
      <br />
      Medipack - Nice Scopes! I have not played Quake or Unreal, but I have played enough RPG games to know what it means. :)<br />
      <br />
      Magma Flow II - I liked your first one better. Cool embossing technique though.<br />
      <br />
      Trippster - Cool! It may be a bit similar to a few presets, but it's faster, and it makes me feel....funny.<br />
      <br />
      Matrix Tribute - I don't care what other people say, I totally agree with you Tug, The Matrix Reloaded kicks major ass. Oh and nice preset too. :D<br />
      <br />
      Particle Accelerator - Reminds me of UnConeD's "Containment" preset.<br />
      <br />
      Golden Age - Wow this is so not you! Usually these are Jim-type presets, but you pulled it off!<br />
      <br />
      Sha-la-la-la - Makes me think of a 12 year old bubble gum chewing empty headed little girl listening to N'Sync. :D<br />
      <br />
      Hypersmooth+ - Woah dats coo! I slippin' dis straight up, bu!<br />
      <br />
      Solero Shots - I have not had this candy before. Sounds good. So is this preset.<br />
      <br />
      Scope In Spotlights - Well that's a neat trick! Nice job.<br />
      <br />
      Snake Skin - Awesome! Shiny Blurry....Fun.<br />
      <br />
      Worm o rama arcade RmX - Wow! Just like on the cell phone! Cool!<br />
      <br />
      Worm or Rama Nic RmX - Not much. I love the watery colorful effect though, fantastic.<br />
      <br />
      Nic's Weirder Blob - Definitley Weird.<br />
      <br />
      Worm O Rama Raz RmX- WAAAA!!! This preset is da bomb! Only one thing - it should go into the east and west corridors. I wanna see what's over there! :D<br />
      <br />
      Pik Slash Nik - Nice preset<br />
      <br />
      Jungle Fever - Woah way too bright. I wanna be this guy right now :cool:<br />
      <br />
      Lactic Acid - Strange Remix<br />
      <br />
      Sidds Weird Blob RmX - Still not much.<br />
      <br />
      Space Tag RmX - I don't know!!! :igor: :igor: :igor:<br />
      <br />
      Piknik Cartoon RmX - Cool shading effect! WHAT THE?!?! There is a <font color="sienna">DEER</font> tapping its antlers on my window!! (this has absolutley nothing to do with this preset) Ok it's gone now. That freaked me out for a minute! :eek:<br />
      <br />
      Shreyas Odour Control RmX - Not much different than the original.<br />
      <br />
      Jello Worm o Rama - That is so cool! Nice job Ishan!<br />
      <br />
      Mquadrat Worm O Rama RmX - Holy Smokes! I didn't know you could make presets like these Mquadrat! Best RmX of the pack! :up:<br />
      <br />
      Weird Blob Magic RmX - Uh, this just got a bit dumber....<br />
      <br />
      Cube Me Up RmX - Very Smooth! Good Preset.<br />
      <br />
      Piknik Crap RmX - PAK-9 are you being sarcastic? This thing is awesome! :)<br />
      <br />
      Digitize Me RmX - Very nice. Kind of like FSK's "Ice Cube" preset.<br />
      <br />
      Worm O Rama Jumpy RmX - It's ok I guess....<br />
      <br />
      Worm O Rama Data Stream RmX - Hell Yeah! Very Nice! Looks like deviantart. :p<br />
      <br />
      WwWwWwWwWow. That took me exactly <b>1 hour and 28 minutes</b> to write. Wait, will Tuggummi be here to read to this? Oh well I don't care.</p>

      <br />
      Worm-o-rama + Hypernet is an awesome combo btw, though only if you modify the scopes so they draw short linesegments instead of dots, and wrap around the edges correctly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks again ya all for the feedback, i appreciate it :up:<br />
      <br />
      But...<br />
      <br />
      UnConeD: I doubt i can make them draw as lines and still make it work... And i don't quite understand the wrap thing... i know the convo blur blurs it that the edges of the screen look a bit ugly, but if you take it away it should look continuos and the wrapping looks fine to me.<br />
      <br />
      And for you 3D freaks imma gonna say that i doubt i will be doing much 3D, It's just so much harder to experiment and get nice result when dealing with an extra dimension and since i have actually no clue how the hell i pull my stuff out, i doubt i can do anything great with 3D. I will just stick to my regular ways of avsing.</p>
