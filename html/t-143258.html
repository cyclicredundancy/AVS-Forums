      <br />
      If yes, where in the hell can you find direct link to them, as i suppose you cant really link them here?<br />
      <br />
      sorry if it s illegal to ask this, I have no clue if it can be done or not.<br />

      <p class="post-content">more importantly...why on earth would you want to? there's absolutely no reason to make presets out of live news feeds; especially since you can't exactly distribute them (in case you haven't noticed not all of us can actually get a live video stream that looks any good). And I need not mention that watching television is what televisions are for (or do I?)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i remember that AOL had commercials that used avs, i think. i am not too sure. But i do remember that someone used avs on tv before. Not exactly a live stream, but it is as close as avs got to tv</p>

      <p class="post-content">I could imagine that it is used to create short video sequences but a live stream would be unusual, the only usefull application would be on music television bot they got video clips instead.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, would be kinda nice to have one hour per week with a VJ on MTV showing international AVS presets on MTV ...droool...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh, I dont want a fullscreen channel, just a lill stream, preferably with great sound quality, that would be great, mostly to hear english and keep my ears used to it (as i don't live in an english speaking country anymore and english isn't my mother tongue) but with some kind of picture its always a bit better than just radio =D, and news channel are talking all the time, better than music with is uterly hard to understand for a foreigner (movie channels would be even better but i doubt it will really be legal)<br />

    A friend of mine saw a preset I made (Pistaccio 2 from my 3rd pack) once on that channel. He said that that channel was non stop music with AVS instead of videos. He didn't watch it much and I don't know if that exists now, probably does. I didn't get an email tho :).<br />

      <p class="post-content">There have a a few reprts of ppl using AVS (and other visualizations) on TV and stuff.<br />
      <br />
      I have some of my MilKDrop stuff on show in the uk 24hours a day here in the UK. Some sky channel 686 I think. So stuff does get out there. Actually with the version coming out they are in need of a upgrade when the beta bugs have been ironed out.<br />
      <br />
      Also got asked about some film &amp; tv work too for FOX in the US but nothing came of it. Made for pre-recorded stuff in After Effects in teh end. :(<br />
      <br />
      All in all there is probably a lot of AVS (and other visualizations) being used on TV a lot of the time.<br />
      <br />
      I would be nice if these TV stations where to ask though for premission to use though. :);)</p>
