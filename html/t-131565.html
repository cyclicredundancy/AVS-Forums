      <br />
      If you want to have a go at messing with the code in zg3, I can whip up an explanation of how it works (most of the code goes into controlling the camera, not the raytracing 'cos that's just cylinders).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Raz_001: what exactly do you mean with 'camera movements'? If you want info, send me an email (steven at acko dot net) with more specific requests.<br />
      <br />
      To understand ZGM3 you need to understand the main trick: there is only one intersection being rendered, which consists of 3 full or half cylinders, and optionally a sphere to close off the holes (eg. if you have a 90° corner). These cylinders are situated on the x,y,z axes.<br />
      <br />
      At the beginning of a 'cycle', a random intersection is calculated in the form of a number (variable 'pat') and every tunnel is either open or closed. Every possible intersection-shape is assigned a number. Note however that there are many intersections that are the same, except that they are mirrored or rotated 90°.<br />
      <br />
      The camera comes out of the negative z tunnel and approaches the intersection. When it reaches the intersection, it rotates towards one of the open tunnels and accelerates again. Once it's cleared the intersection, it is moved back to the negative z-axis at the correct offset, and it is ready to approach a new intersection. There are three intersections where the camera will go straight ahead, and this is handled as a special case (variable 'qz' true/false).<br />
      <br />
      To the viewer it looks of course as if it is going through a continuous maze, but this is just a trick ;).<br />
      <br />
      The movement of the camera is handled in phases (var 'ph'). Every phase corresponds to one of the possible situations the camera can be in (approaching intersection, rotating towards tunnel, accelerating).<br />
      For every phase, there is code for modifying the camera's position and/or rotation, and code that specifies under which conditions we should move to another phase.<br />
      <br />
      For example, phase 1 in ZGM3 is when the camera has rotated towards the correct tunnel and must now move into it. Phase 1 ends when the camera's distance to the center of the intersection is higher than the intersection's radius: in this case, the other tunnels are no longer visible and we can snap the camera back into the negative z tunnel.<br />
      <br />
      By splitting up the camera movement into small phases that are each simple to code, you can easily create complicated routines without going into code-hell.</p>

      <p class="post-content">UnConeD, just one question: In ZGmaze 2 when it goes into the tunnel, does the code specify a time rotating in the intersection then shifts it forward a bit into the tunnel then moves the texture for a specified time then snaps it back into the intersection?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not sure what you mean, but ZGM2 is not as advanced as ZGM3... it always goes down the positive Z-tunnel.<br />
      <br />
      In ZGM2, the phase variable is 'md' (mode). If i recall correctly, phase 0 is rotating in the intersection, phase 1 is rotating to face the positive z tunnel, phase 2 is moving into the tunnel and phase 3 is arriving from the negative tunnel. The snapback occurs when switching from phase 2 to 3.</p>
