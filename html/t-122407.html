      Here's a preset I made recently with balls bouncing around the screen and off of eachother. It was somewhat difficult to program in the synching between SSCs and uses a lot of code. Right now, it is somewhat plain, and I was wondering if anybody had some ideas about what to do to it. I was thinking of making them spheres instead, and have them bounce around in a box. They aren't dynamic at all except for their original speed which is based on getosc(it needs slower music in order for you to see the bouncing better). I also need help fixing the bug where the balls get stuck on the edges sometimes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">From the comment?<br />
      <br />
      Also, bouncing is done correctly, but it isn't too noticible and doing it correctly would use too many variables.<br />
      <br />
      ??? :p<br />
      <br />
      Turn them in the cars on a road maybe. Make it into a racing preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heres what i did with it, its 3am so dont expect it to be good and btw, color clips are my answer to everything, at 3am anyway.<br />
      its a bit tempremental and decides to not make the circles move sometimes, just reselect it and it should work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like how it shows the path that it followed, but it isn't the greatest effect. The reason the balls don't always move is because their initial velocities use getosc and if no sound(or little sound) is being played first, then they don't move.</p>

      If they changed sizes, and were textured + rotated, it'd be cool :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Crap, is it really that noticible? I tried doing it the correct way, but it would use more than 64 variables if I did more than 3 balls. Yeah, my shortcut is pretty cheap, but do you know a better way to do it? AVS really needs to be updated, this would be so easy with lists, global variables, ...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Tell us something we don't know :hang: Has anyone been bitching at the WA staff lately to get this done? An hour of work on updating AVS a day, that's all we ask - it'd be done in a month or so.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Can anybody give me a quick refresher on 2D momentum stuff? I need to find the final x and y velocities given the initial velocities. I was working on finding a better way to do real collisions today, but I had a brain fart and kept on messing up. Also, I am trying to keep down the variable usage to a minimum so any tips on that would be most appreciated. Each individual SSC must keep track of all of the balls positions, speeds etc.<br />
      Also, who can I write to try to get nullsoft to add global variables? This is starting to really piss me off:mad: . I mean, global variables aren't that hard to do, I know enough programming to do it. Oh well, they probably won't do anything(at least not until they get the bugs out of winamp3).</p>
