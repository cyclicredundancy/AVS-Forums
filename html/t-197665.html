      <p class="post-content">I'd like to appologize Matt, sometimes just this random stuff happens when we here are asked questions liked this. As you probably already know their a quite a few threads posted in this fourms that discuss 3D scoping. The finer points do usually seem a bit hard to grasp at first, but a better way to learn how to deal with them is to look at what the other threads say, look at some basic 3D presets, and if all else fails, nicely PM somone who has a very good understanding of the concept. Making a thread with the title TEACH ME!!! is just asking to be flamed, so good luck learning 3D!<br />
      <br />
      //add<br />
      Another good thing to do is to search for more then one thing, instead of just searching for 3D Superscopes or something like that, try a bunch of different things like 3D coding, Superscopes, 3D, etc...</p>

      <p class="post-content">There isn't an actual formula for a cube because it's not a function(well, not entirely I guess, there might be some ways to do it with some fancy 3D graphing, but it would still probably require more then one equation or some sort of uber-leetness). In your math you probably graph functions. Things like f(x)=x², or f(x)=ax²+bx+c, as the polynomial form. To make a cube in avs we can do it two ways, we either use a special formula that makes a cube like shape using the concepts of circles with limited points, or we use point-per-point superscoping. Point-per-point scoping involves setting the x,y, and z cordinate manually based on a per-point counter.<br /></p>

      <p class="post-content">Personally, I think the point-per-point version is better, the main concept behind it is using a custom counter (in my previours example, the variable A), as a custom counter value that will increase by one for each point in the scope. Using the variable A, you can then make set each indidual point to have its own X and Y and Z location. If you understand the basics of how a superscope draws a shape, you should be able to figure out how that works and how to implement that.</p>

      </blockquote>Actually AVS uses a fairly standard rectangular coordinate system so most geometry translates fairly easily... ask your teacher how to plot a 3D line with right handed coordinates and she'll probably give you some useful information. Then ask her how to use matrices to rotate coordinates in discreet increments and she will probably give you some more useful information.<br />
      <br />
      Of course most noobs want to jump straight into coding... you need to get the fundementals of maths down first, most noobs dont even know how to manipulate a sine wave correctly.

      <br />
      Seriously dude. You are a flame magnet. A fucking big-arse pile of dry wood and paper on a really hot day.. or something.<br />
      grrr..<br />
      <br />
      If you have seriously tried to make your way through one of the many tutorials that are floating around, then you will have at least made some progress. The basic concepts are not hard at all, providing that you can speak english, which you obviously can.<br />
      <br />
      If you still claim not to have a clue at all, then either: You are a literal vegetable and there is no hope for you at all, or you are flame baiting. Either way, it isnt worth anyones trouble to help you out.<br />
      <br />
      However, if (and i think this is far more likely) you just think you are too good to devout some attention to a generic tutorial, when you really deserve to be given specific help just for you, among the scores of people that come here, then i think you really need to think about what you are asking for.<br />
      <br />
      All you have said is "I NEED HELP WITH 3D". That doesnt tell anyone shit. so please:<br /></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read tutorial(s)</li>

        <li>Have a serious attempt</li>

        <li>Think about where you are stuck</li>

        <li>Come back here and use up your last token on this thread before it is *clunked*. BE SPECIFIC!</li>

That gives me an idea. All you avs "pros" out there go back and look the the very first preset you ever made and and see how your skills have grown.

        Seriously dude. You are a flame magnet. A fucking big-arse pile of dry wood and paper on a really hot day.. or something.<br />
        grrr..<br />
        <br />
        If you have seriously tried to make your way through one of the many tutorials that are floating around, then you will have at least made some progress. The basic concepts are not hard at all, providing that you can speak english, which you obviously can.<br />
        <br />
        If you still claim not to have a clue at all, then either: You are a literal vegetable and there is no hope for you at all, or you are flame baiting. Either way, it isnt worth anyones trouble to help you out.<br />
        <br />
        However, if (and i think this is far more likely) you just think you are too good to devout some attention to a generic tutorial, when you really deserve to be given specific help just for you, among the scores of people that come here, then i think you really need to think about what you are asking for.<br />
        <br />
        All you have said is "I NEED HELP WITH 3D". That doesnt tell anyone shit. so please:<br /></b>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Read tutorial(s)</b></li>

          <li><b>Have a serious attempt</b></li>

      <p class="post-content">If we did a 'first preset' pack I would just cheat to make myself look good by posting some totally kick-ass preset that clearly wasn't my first.<br />
      <br />
      Who the hell has their first preset still on their computer anyway? It was 5 years ago or something, I think I've formatted 4 times, thrown the hdd away, bought a new one, formatted it at least twice and had to reinstall winamp easily 20 times over that period.<br />
      <br />
      Plus I question the logic of releasing a pack which intentionally contains some of the worst presets ever made. I suppose you could 'remake' the preset rather than just post a good new one... but how do you remake a render ring and trans water?</p>

      <p class="post-content">h*w is a statement that should never occur in any AVS ever, you never need every pixel to be represented by a point. It would be better to use a texer2 with some dynamic sizing and a dynamic number of points, having a circle as a point instead of a dot or line gives a much nicer look, requires far less points and doesnt introduce 'jaggies' and other bugs when you throw it around a lot.<br />
      <br />
      As for the preset, personally I'd do the opposite of sidd, have a DM for the water and a ssc/texer2 for the ring/torus.</p>

      well, my life consists of next year i AM the pretty amauteur i did these up last week comparison is that my work is all craaap... i cant even get a real girlfriend, im a psychologically confused person; who does web-design and avs for a living including school, at school i just failed my maths quadratics assignment soon coming a maths exam and 4 assignments to hand in on the next week...! i've done most of...! ;) i haven't been to avs 4 a while [ excusing my absences ], next year for #11: ill study IPT (information processing technologies), maths b, physics, bct (business ed:: you get some certificate for it! :D), practial art (i also get a certificate for...), and of course always dreaded english<br />
      __<br />
      will any of this help, and im having trouble understanding most of the 3D code that was given to me by Jaak [ was a friend :( ] he tryed many times explaining to me the 3D code just liked to say sorry ok ? hope he heard it<br />
      <br />
      he's one of the best friends i <b>HAD!</b><br />
      i'd like to say you guys are harsh on high-school student(s)... im only <b>15</b> and <b>AUSTRALIA</b> has the <i>CRAPPEST SCHOOLING!!!!</i><br />

      im now learning php, mySQL, and setting up a server also i wanna study at cisco universities... well this is all i got to say<br />

      <p class="post-content">look no matter what you want to do, avs, milkdrop, php whatever, you are going to have to learn to have some patience. Your problem seems to pan out like this:<br />
      <br />
      1. you want everything done for you<br />
      2. you don't listen to anyone's advice<br />
      <br />
      No one flamed you when you first arived here, but you didn't listen to anyone's advice and kept asking for more, and people(me) got annoyed.<br />
      <br />
      Now, don't take it like im beating you up. Please read my post in its entirety.<br />
      <br />
      Dont worry about the maths, particuarly at school. Keep school and avs completely seperate. The things you will want to know in avs are more related to graphics and programming than they are to maths. Learn at your own pace, and experiment with the superscope.<br />
      <br />
      From looking at your presets (please don't take offense to this) you need to learn the basics before you can rush into 3D geometry. Learning how the 3d presets work will be very difficult for you if you dont completely understand how AVS's scripting language works.<br />
      <br />
      Getting good at avs, or milkdrop for that matter, involves taking a serious interest and developing your skills at your own rate. You actually have to do things on your own! You can't just rely on other people to tell you what to do and how to do it.<br />
      <br />
      So, go on and run off to milkdrop land if you want, but that is your loss. And i dont just mean because milkdrop is so rediculously inferior, i mean because you have given up so easily. If you go off to think MD forums now, and act the same as you have acted here, they will probably treat you just like we have. If you get discouraged like that, and run off scared because you are new, then you arn't going to get good at anything.<br />
      <br />
      <b>YOU</b> need to do the work!<br />
      <br />
      [edit] By the way, if you read my post up there, I also made my first preset when i was 15. And it was much worse than the ones that you posted. Plus, I'm also from Australia, so you can't use that as an excuse :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm only 16 and made my first preset in april this year, i never asked for help, and none of the maths i've learnt at school has helped. Infact the maths i've learnt through avs has helped at school. In almost a year i've still only just got the grip of decent dms and superscopes (working on some 3d stuff now). As i said before, this takes time, but if your like me and mess around with avs instead of doing homework or study (which i should be doing now) it'll take less time.<br />
      The best way to learn is to download <b>heaps</b> of presets of all standards and find one with a basic dm and ssc, rip them to peices, re write them, build your own preset around them until you know what everything does. Then move up to a more complex preset and do the same thing. Keep going until you can write stuff yourself (you'll notice that each kind of dm/ssc that does the same kind of thing has fairly similar code). Tear presets to bits and mess around with it until you understand, and then you'll be able to do what you want.</p>

      <br />
      2. age doesnt matter,<br />
      Atero made freakin 4D cube with ssc when he was 15 (maybe 14 or 16 :p), some people have started doing invert + water + rottoblitter + simple compos when they are 20/30/whatever<br />
      <br />
      3. its all about <b><u>LEARNING</u></b><br />

      Uhm, Matt. uuh, you suck. Because *mumbles* you just do :igor: Now go off to the.... m-i-l-k-d-r-o-p forums, but in my experience it is even harder than AVS (and it smells).

      <p class="post-content">Not an insult, merely a tip for your own safety:<br />
      <br />
      Stay away from these forums for a while before things get out of hand.<br />
      Just start messing around with AVS on your own and try to see what you can come up with on your own, this will also give a great oppurtunity to further develop your own style instead of following our leads.<br />
      <br />
      Then, when you've got some base experience to build up from, come back again and we'll be pleased to help you furter. Like this, we're not going to make process together anyhow.</p>
