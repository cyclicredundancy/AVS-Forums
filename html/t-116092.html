(I tend to go using either pastel colours or neon cyberpunk and sometimes naturalistic eartyh colours) Even if this is what I intend for I usually end up getting something slightly different, althought I seem compelled towards the fire spreads of yellow through to dark red alot ? mabey I'm a fire bug at heart.<br><br>I'm not really overly colour orientated, But I do think that colour schemes are almost one of the most important parts of AVS, Afterall its colours that link us deeper to our primal minds than effects. Some of the best presets I've seen are suprizingly simple but can have you staring for hours just because the look so asthetically nice. Then again I think its totaly viable to fuck up a colour scheme for artistic purposes, (that should be justifed BTW). Just look at art paintings and photo's by really good artists, you'll see what artists are going for, ie. some of Andy Warhols art is very colour specific even though it might look a bit off to start with, It's usually accompanied by a rush of realisation.<br><br>Shit I hope that didn't sound too wanky.<br><br>Just find something that really (really) appeals to you colour specificaly and reduce it down to its composites and emulate it with extreemist fanaticism. then no-one can bust your chops cause, their simple overlook cannot compare to extreem intent and manipulation even if it looks like baby puke. Someone who has a subconcious connection to baby puke is probbably going to get some kind of enlightenment out of it.<br><br>just "do what you wanna do, be what you wanna be .. yeah"<br><br>For and example of some colour schemes I'ved used I've attached a couple presest I did way before I ever looked at the coding side of things back about a year ago with Winamp 2 baby yeah !<br><br>One's what I think the surface of the sun looks like, the other is a good example of baby puke, but I'm solid in my intent for the colours. Dont be too impressed tho they're made with original presets.<br><br><br><br>*********************************************************************<br><br>B4 I go cause I'm new to Avs maths code does does any of the experienced Guru's out there know how to emulate matricie equation's, "SETS" or 3D coordinates into Avs variables.

They take alot of time to perfect, seeing as you have 256 million of em or something (dont bother correcting me if I'm wrong I dont care).<br><br>You are right tho one step at a time. I'm getting to grips with one part at a time myself, mainly the SSC I havn't even looked a DM's yet . I've checked heaps through the forums and got a fair bit out of it especially the basics, I got some wicked help from UnConeD to the way SSC can emulate 3d, and I think as far as help goes I was pretty lucky to get as indepth descripiton as that (hey Atero). But still It's a matter of reasearching yourself for more advanced stuff... I'm lucky to have gotten one of my maths lectures into or having a look, ( he's the full mathematician Phd kitancaboodle ), at AVS belive it or not, It's cool tho because I fully get to pick his brain, and he probly feels like he's down with the funky hip young kids with there pop music.. Never know tho it might become part of the curriculum, I doubt it but that'd be cool...<br><br>"Ok for today's lecture we're going to have alook at the Advanced Visualisation Studio ... It actually responds to the musical frequencies like this track i've put on, "Fuck the police" by N.W.A."<br><br>The point I was origanly trying to make tho was It takes alot of time just to make one preset if your going for something specific..<br><br>If you want something thats "Not going to make people puke" meaning a majority of the populous.. do some research (psycologicaly based perhaps) on popular colour schemes like through history and you should be able to find stuff in thousands of Art books on pop art and such. Or even colour schemes for popular housing ... or marketing. ( as far a popularity is concerned). Take a trip to the libaray or search engine.<br><br>My problem being all the stuff I want to specificaly make is beyond my Avs control in it's intirety for now, But if your brain works like it should you get there eventually as each part become more clear.<br><br>I'd be interested to compare some of you SSC's cmontford if your up for a bit of back and forth on that topic..</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th December 2002 08:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><b><font size="1">Originally posted by VisualAgnosia</font></b><br>I really like some of the Tuggummi ones.</blockquote>Hearing that someone likes my stuff always makes me happy :D<br><br>God Speed with your avs:ing! :up:</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">VisualAgnosia</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th December 2002 11:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>LOTR</strong><br>Hey CMountford,<br><br>This ones for you buddy Inspired by your version of Sauron's eye, Still cant get heaps of elements to happen as I'd like to but it's just a start.<br><br>Hey Tuggummi, If I could only get the flames like your "Burning" Preset (props 2 U bruzza).

I like to be able to fill the holes in the flames and have the direction of the Psudeo wind mabey swiviling 180 to the right and back etc. I'm speuing tho cause I had an effect happening where I had the words jumping up with the flames almost half the screen but my computer blue screened and I hadn't saved it and couldn't replicate it again.
