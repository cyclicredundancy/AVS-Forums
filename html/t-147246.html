      <p class="post-content"><strong>Effect list and buffers</strong><br />
      Hellow world !<br />
      <br />
      Just a little question :<br />
      <br />
      Can anybody explain how works buffers in input and output of an effect list ?<br />
      And about the reverse (or inverse, I can't remember) option ?<br />
      <br />
      AFAIK, using a buffer as Input seems to be identical to a Buffer in restore mode at the top of the effect list, but I can't see what exactly happens with a buffer in Output of the effect list.<br />
      <br />
      Help me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ooops ! I haven't search enough in the forums. :-(<br />
      <br />
      To answer my question :<br />
      <br />
      When buffers are used in input of an effect list, the existing image is blended to the image of the effect list accordingly to the luminosity of the image contained in that buffer (the more the image is clear, the more the existing image is visible). The "Inverse" option just inverse this image, that means, inverse its luminosity.<br />
      And of course, the same principle is used in output to blend the result of the effect list.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks Atero.<br />

      [ in other words, that means that the tutorial in my website - still only in french, but if someone want to translate it :-) - got a big mistake ... I have some work to do ;-) ]</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well.<br />
      <br />
      1st : It's a big work (screen captures must be done with english version) and I have so many things to do ...<br />
      <br />
      2nd : My english is not good enough (I think) to make a tutorial. By definition, a tutorial is the first guide of a beginner, so it must be very clear and easy to understand.<br />
      <br />
      Conclusion : May be I'll do it, one day ... except if someone do it for me ;-)</p>

      <br />
      I've put all my tutorial in a Word document (72 pages !) to make a PDF file I'll put soon on my web site.<br />
      <br />
      So, I made a copy of this document and tried to translate the first pages ... and it seems not to be so difficult I thought.<br />
      I have decided to translate all the text (and images :) ), and to publish it in a PDF file (at winamp.com, for example). I'll keep you informed ...<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks Anubis,<br />
      <br />
      But I think I was not very clear. I'm looking for someone to read the English version and tell me what's wrong. The document will have probably 70 pages, with screen shots and other images.<br />
      <br />
      Your offer is very pleasing, but as I wrote the French version, I feel free to change some sentences during the translation. I think it's more difficult to someone else to do this in the same way. At least, it can gives weird differences for same sentences in the final document.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks anyway.<br />
