      <br />
      <b><a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">download</a></b><br />
      <br />
      one of the new features is the pimp switch ("pimpbot.exe /pimp"). this not only compiles the installer, but also creates a pimp-file. that pimpfile holds all the files from the installer and the information necessary to re-compile it at a later moment. it was previously supported to recompile (and edit) the last compiled installer, the pimp switch allows you to recompile all previous installers. this only works through a switch, as i plan to change the entire ui for pimpbot 3.<br />
      <br />
      all you need is <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/download" target="_blank">nsis 2.07</a> (or higher). you should also uninstall the previous version of pimpbot (unless it's a pimpbot 2½ version).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>introducing PimpBot Runtime</strong><br />
      new version is <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">available</a> now!<br />
      <br />
      this new version introduces the <i>PimpBot Runtime</i>. as pimpbot creates .pimp files including all settings for the installers and includes all installable data, i thought it could become a good alternative to actual installers.<br />
      <br />
      so rather than compiling an installer, you can take the .pimp file which pimpbot creates anyway and distribute as if it was a zip with your data. just that you get all the comfort from a pimpbot installer. this means smaller downloads and no more suspicion against executables. the downside of course is that the user requires pimpbot runtime.<br />
      <br />
      at this time it only ships with pimpbot, later it will be available as a seperate download. the main reason for this is, that it doesn't install apes or fonts yet. the apes will btw be installed with pimpbot runtime, in order to keep the .pimp files small.<br />
      <br />
      by default, .pimp files still get opened in pimpbot for modification/recompilation. to install the contents, you have to do a right-click and press on 'install'.<br />
      <br />
      bugs and suggestions can be posted here. enjoy!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>standalone download</strong><br />
      for testing purposes (without installer!), you can also grab <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/pimpbotRT-alpha1.zip" target="_blank">pimpbotRT-alpha1.zip</a> standalone.<br />
      <br />
      1. extract the content<br />
      2. drag .pimp on the .exe<br />
      3. install<br />
      4. compare 28kb of the.pimp to the 211kb <a href="http://www.visbot.net/20060916/dynamic-movement-6/" target="_blank">dm6</a> installer<br />
      <br />
      and hopefully no more <a href="http://www.visbot.net/20060817/virus-reports/" target="_blank">false positive</a> virus reports on nsis installers (and if then only for the runtime itself, as it's written in nsis).</p>

      can you make a confirmation on the uninstaller? Because I, not on purpose, click the installer and uninstall pimpbot...<br />
      AARGH my unfinished compilation is lost....<br />
      <br />
      So can you make the confirmation like "Are you sure you want to uninstall pimpbot?" thanks.:up:<br />

      i've figured that the problem with reloading .pimp files into PimpBot and installing .pimp files directly is not a bug in PimpBot, it's actually a bug in 7-zip! so, it all works when you got a proper 7-zip installation. otherwise the commandline will not extract the .pimp file. i hope this will be fixed soon!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot Runtime beta</strong><br />
      pimpbotRT went beta and can be downloaded <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pimpbot/pimpbotRT-beta-setup.zip?use_mirror=osdn" target="_blank">here</a> (includes examples).<br />
      <br />
      what is it again?<br />
      all new pimpbot version store the data of your installer in a .pimp file, so you can recompile/edit it easily at any time. so why not distribute the .pimp files directly? this is where pimpbotRT comes in. loading a .pimp file into pimpbotRT will create an installer on runtime, hence the name. the benefit? smaller files, less false virus reports.. or you can just unzip the files with any 7-zip compatible tool (i.e. winrar).<br />
      <br />
      what's new?<br />
      installs fonts, shows the license page. minor bugfixes too.<br />
      <br />

      a new pimpbot version was just released, you can download it <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">here</a><br />
      <br />
      new features:<br />
      -skinning support was added, allowing you skin your installer as you might have seen it with the wfc5 installer. compatible with any winamp classic skin (if containing <i>gen.bmp</i> and <i>genex.bmp</i>). don't blame me for ugly installers ;)<br />
      <br />
      -brought back <a href="http://creativecommons.org" target="_blank">creative commons</a> license support. instead of loading a license, you can just type the common abbreviations as used by cc (e.g. <i>by-nc-sa</i> or <i>by-nc</i>). the file names of the included licenses give a clue, otherwise check <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay.. problem..<br />
      <br />
      I used PimpBot 3 beta 2 to package a compilation ( collection of presets ) 312 AVS to be exact..<br />
      <br />
      I created it and I ran into a few issues..maybe you could shed some light or maybe..it will help bring it out of beta to a full release..<br />
      <br />
      I dunno..<br />
      <br />
      I made mention of the issue in a previous post where I was inquiring about a program to package these for submission..instead of using instructions and a RAR file..<br />
      <br />
      1. After creating the .exe file..When tested the installer throws all of the files right over into the avs folder without their respective 'Visualization' folder which is there to contain the presets and keep them separate for people who like to keep them separated by collection...I tried to go backward one dir and still had the same issue.<br />
      <br />
      2. When using a picture for the splash screen which I thought would be really cool.. it would not accept any file of any size and gave me an error message that stated the Wave file I was wanting to submit was too large then opened a page in my web browser..The icon worked though.<br />
      <br />
      3. When I entered in a wave file to use I got the same message..<br />
      <br />
      4. What I was looking for something that would actually install the folder with avs and any missing apes, bmp's and so on..I am not really a scripter or anything.. and am not fluent with NSIS..<br />
      <br />
      I actually like the idea of installing the presets that way because it actually is better for random play of the avs's but there will probably be that one person who wants to pull their hair out because they have just installed 312 files into the main dir for the avs's ...<br />
      <br />
      Incidientally I am running on XP sp2 ... if that has anything to do with it ..</p>

      <br />
      2. only bitmaps are supported as images, wave files as sound.<br />
      <br />
      3. as i've read in your other posting you tried to add a 38mb wave file?! do you really think people are happy to download ~40mb when the large amount of that is just a stupid splash-sound? have a look at <a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/visualization/349229/" target="_blank">http://forum.deviantart.com/gallerie...zation/349229/</a><br />
      <br />
      4. pimpbot makes sure you don't overwrite new ape versions with older ones, unlike winrar sfx it also detects the proper install path of winamp.. plus many other features :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well I am sure that you are proud of the installer as I would be of anything I would have created but so far I think the only thing you actually addressed or realized what I was saying was in Number one..<br />
      <br />
      I followed the guidelines, and created .bmp files specifically for that in PS CS2 v9 two sizes one 153 KB and another 53 KB.. I honestly thought it was like a hang up like if enter it in and it keeps thinking the file is still there, even after the deletion of the entry..examples are as follows..<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/smaller.bmp" target="_blank">http://70.254.144.202:8086/out/smaller.bmp</a><br />
      <br />
      And yes I am not so 'insert some word here' that I would upload a 38.5 MB file for the installer...and I can create my own smaller waves with my software.. the whole logistics of mentioning it was that.. I grabbed a wave file stuck it in got the message removed it and still got the message..then I exited the installer and then tried again with just the .bmp file..and just with something in the place for the splash image.. I still get the same message..<br />
      that a wave file was too large and it opened a window for the change over to another type of wave file, which is a search window for google..<br />
      <br />
      Maybe I was a little unclear to you..but that was the order of events exactly as they happened with this particular instance...<br />
      <br />
      I don't know hat could be causing the problem unless I have something installed on my system that would be interfering with it or something.</p>

      </blockquote>Tut-tut. Did I make these complaints when mattfury tried to load an 8kx8k texture into Image2GVM? Even though the megabuf is limited to a million entries? No. Instead I fixed the <b>bug</b> in my software. You could always do the same, it will stop people from making the same mistake in future...<br />
      <br />
      Also, downloading 40MB is nothing these days... but you already know my opinion on file sizes :p<br />
      <br />
      heath: Pimpbot rules and has worked exceptionally in the past, so I doubt that yathosho's pride is fueling his response.. more likely the frustration that someone would try something stupid enough to break it and not realise what caused the problem..

      <p class="post-content">i'm glad there's finally some feedback, as it helps me to track down bugs - that splash sound behaviour was indeed a bug, which i fixed this minute. new beta available <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">now</a>!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Cool..on it..<br />
      <br />
      Thanks Yathosho...and you are in there too and Jheriko.. and I don't even know who else..<br />
      <br />
      Oh and I just redid the Presets, and it works..with the splash screen!!:)<br />
      <br />
      Still having a little issue with the directory .. I dunno what I could be doing wrong.. this is how I set up the folders<br />
      <br />
      Desktop--<br />
      <br />
      AVS---<br />
      ( all possible avi's .bmp's )<br />
      <br />
      Private Compilation 2006--<br />
      Private Compilation 2006--<br />
      ( avs files )<br />
      <br />
      and then I get an error log..<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      File: "avs\*.avs" -&gt; no files found.<br />
      Usage: File [/nonfatal] [/a] ([/r] [/x filespec [...]] filespec [...] |<br />
      /oname=outfile one_file_only)<br />
      Error in script "C:\DOCUME~1\Owner\LOCALS~1\Temp\nsk228E.tmp\script.nsi" on line 223 -- aborting creation process<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      But it will still grab them from the first PC2006 dir and build the installer but when tested but the avs's go into the dir where the folder shoudl be..<br />
      <br />
      So have I done something wrong..according to the log file it looks like the rror is actually coming from the NSIS that i had to install...</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>pimpbot 3.2 beta</strong><br />
      it's been a while and there might not be much reason left to update pimpbot, but i did so anyway. let me sum up the news.<br />
      <br />
      1. DROPFOLDER<br />
      though pimpbot already makes it very easy to create an installer for your presets, i tried to make it even easier. stick to certain conventions and you can simply drop your project-folder on the pimpbot icon and it will detect the contents automatically. check attachment for details!<br />
      <br />
      2. BACKUPS<br />
      pimpbot now includes a backup tool. at the moment you only get a stripped down version of syncbot. it allows you to make offline and online backups of your presets and your previous pimpbot compilations. will get better features and will be integrated in the compiler.<br />
      <br />
      3. TWEAKS<br />
      so far, pimpbot's default settings suited my personally preferred settings. you can easily change this by launching pimpbot with the /defaults parameter. this will disable all the checks pimpbot usually does and allows you to put your prefered defaults in any of the fields pimpbot offers. next time you launch an empty pimpbot project, your defaults will be used.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 3.2 FINAL</strong><br />
      PimpBot 3.2 is out now and brings many new features (see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=131574&amp;release_id=573899" target="_blank">changelog</a>).. here are the most important ones:<br />
      <br />
      -DragFolder: simply drag a folder on the PimpBot icon and it will guess most of the settings, if you follow the <u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=2278194" target="_blank">sensible defaults</a></u><br />
      <br />
      -Customization: all default settings can now be adjusted, for instance you could specify the same icon for all of your installers or have multilingual installers as default setting<br />
      <br />
      -Backups: while the betas still contained a modified version of <a href="http://syncbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">SyncBot</a>, the new backup tool was written almost from scratch. it supports dual backups for your presets and pimpbot files - online, locally or both<br />
      <br />
      i also want to point out that PimpBot runs flawlessly on Linux and Mac OS X - if equipped with WINE/Darwine. this <u><a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/screencast.html" target="_blank">screencast</a></u> was made on ubuntu 6.x (sound is still missing).<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 3.2.1</strong><br />
      before working on the next major release of pimpbot, i will introduce slight improvements and updates for the 3.2 family. hence the first update was released, pimpbot 3.2.1<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>v3.2.1 "Countdown" (2008-02-12)<br /> * Compiler: removed advanced setting ApeQuestion<br /> * Compiler: added /flush switch<br /> * Compiler: code clean-up<br /> * Backup: fixed bug with .pimp file backup<br /> * Backup: fixed bug in remembering previous settings<br /> * Backup: code clean-up</code>
</pre><br />
      pimpbot 3.2.2 is already in the pipe, it will basically integrate pimpbot backup into the compiler. this will allow you to backup newly created installers right after creation.<br />
      <br />
      i'd to get some feedback on the backup module in meantime. it's not available as a seperate download, but comes with the compiler package. once you launched it you have several options available:<br />
      <br />
      -backup your avs folder (avs files only/all files + recursive option)<br />
      -same as above for milkdrop and sps (other plugins might follow)<br />
      -backup your default pimp folder (e.g. "My Pimp Files")<br />
      <br />
      you have than multiple choices on how to backup:<br />
      <br />
      -backup to one/two local/network mounted drives<br />
      -backup to one/two ftp servers<br />
      -a combination of the above<br />
      <br />
      i'm also trying to add the option to use gmail webspace as backup destination. it yousendit/sendspace/etc. offer an option, i will have a look at those.<br />
      <br />
      you can download all of the above mentioned -as usual- @ <a href="http://pimpbot.whyeye.org/" target="_blank">pimpbot website</a>

      <p class="post-content">been going through old posting on the board to reproduce the release dates for each release. pimpbot is there for 5 years already! i'm still having plans to do major releases, though my main motivation is not its original purpose anymore: creating installers for avs. i'm more interested in creating better nsis scripts and ui, and i also plan to support installers for other purposes than avs.<br />
      <br />
      it's quite sad, that only about 20 people make use of this program, without even knowing about some of the features i built in in the 3.x series. namely that's dragfolder, which allows much faster compiling of packs. also the pimp files hasn't become a popular way of distribution, though they provide more security and much smaller files. well, the days are over!<br />
      <br />
      i also want to thank for all you people's support. bugfixing, suggestions, translations..<br />

      <pre>
<code>v3.4 alpha (2008-09-10)<br /> * renamed executables to compiler.exe, backup.exe and runtime.exe<br /> * Compiler: added support for installing Sonique plugins (.svp)<br /> * Compiler: fixed bug with custom wizard image<br /> * Backup: added check for existing file on server<br /> * Backup: modified error output<br /> * Backup: fixed bug with input files containing spaces in filename<br /> * RunTime: added support for installing Sonique plugins (.svp)<br /> * upgraded 7-zip to 4.60<br /> * upgraded curl to 7.19.0<br /> * improved setup<br /> * improved documentation</code>
</pre><br />
      the release should be just as stable as v3.3.3, i just labeled it alpha as most of the work has not yet been done. the svp feature came into my mind after reviewing a lot of old packs from the visbot archive.

      you can help me test the product by just installing and running it. just let your last pack recompile or use one of your old .pimp files to compile it to an installer. if there are bugs, post the log-file in this forum.<br />

      the new version adds one feature to the compiler. there's an option to zip the finished installer and add a text or diz file to the archive. backup now has autoclose and save passwords options, though both can only be applied through the <i>pimpbot.ini</i>. saving passwords is not recommended and should only be used on trusted machines, as there's no mechanism to encrypt the password.<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm advising everybody to upgrade PimpBot Runtime to <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pimpbot/pimpbotRT-1.1-setup.exe?download" target="_blank">v1.1</a>, as i'm planning to switch the compression type in the future. the new version will detect lzma2 compression and advise the user to upgrade to a newer version of Pimpbot Runtime (presumably that will be 2.x).<br />
      <br />
      i am writing this, as the latest runtime is not yet included in the beta of Pimpbot 3.5 - it will be in later beta versions!<br />
      <br />
      edit: at the moment it seems like lzma2 compressed .pimp files can also be extracted using old 7-zip versions</p>

      okay, i couldn't resist but release a second beta.<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>v3.5 beta2 (2009-06-30)<br /> * Compiler: added dialog when unpacking large files<br /> * Compiler: added notification if skin is selected<br /> * Compiler: improved warning if skin is missing or incomplete<br /> * RunTime: added dialog when unpacking large files<br /> * RunTime: added dialog when unpacking potentially incompatible files<br /> * Installer: enhanced brainpower ;)</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      both the compiler and the runtime now display an unpacking dialog when a .pimp file meets a certain file-size. this way, unpacking large files will no longer appear as idling.<br />
      <br />
      as i've noticed skins are not fully supported by vista/window7, i added a warning when choosing a skin. i'm thinking about removing skinning entirely, i'm not much of a friend of skinned installers anyway<br />
      <br />
      lastly, i have improved the installer. rather than being bothered with the same settings with every new installation, it now remembers the choice from a previous installation. example: you don't want to install a shortcut on your desktop. so far, you had to deselect its creation everytime you upgrade pimpbot (unless you are using the shortcut already). the all new version will remember the next time, if you deselected shortcut creation. guess this improves the usability a lot.<br />

      </blockquote>at the time when the first pimpbot came out, nsis were frequent, so i wanted the user to download the latest version of nsis. however, as the final version of pimpbot might get an option to selfupdate, i could use the same code in the installer to check for the lastest version, download and install it.

      guess what, beta 3 is out as of today!<br />
      <br />
      improved installer, improved videodelay handling, a couple of minor changes.. and an updater! the latter does what it sounds like, in a predefined interval it will check if there's a new version of pimpbot available. it kinda works (not on vista/win7), but i already got much better ideas for a future version (thanks grandchild for testing).<br />

      pimpbot 3.6 brings back the last remaining feature that hasn't been available since early pimpbot 2.x versions: the settings page for installers! much better than before, this lets users configure their avs installation during the installation of your pack. however, this is only an optional feature!<br />
      <br />
      i also added some useful scripts, that you might want to use to update your .pimp files to the new standard (not really necessary at this point), a standalone app for avs settings (same used in the installers) or to grab the splash image from an existing installer.<br />

        The installer gave me the following message (translated from Dutch):<br />
        <br />
        "Setup couldn't find a valid Winamp installation. Continue? (NOT recommended)"
      </blockquote>did you install winamp properly or did you just copy your old installation? did you save that program files path in your registry or is it a directory you just created and have to select manually for each installation?<br />
      <br />
      pimpbot installers use the registry keys created by the winamp installer to determine the correct path. if that fails, it assumes <i>%PROGRAMFILES%\Winamp</i> to be the path.<br />
      <br />
      you can always use the /unzip switch to extract the presets from the installer (<i>Installer.exe /unzip</i>) or the nsis default /D to override the destination (<i>Installer.exe /D=F:\Program Files\Winamp</i>).<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        It also asks me to remember the location for further installations but I said no.
      </blockquote>this is so the above won't happen the next time you install winamp. what it does is create the (missing) winamp key in your registry.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        Also, if I choose to continue anyway, if finishes the installation without actually installing the files
      </blockquote>will look into this, it's probably related to the above. installer works perfectly on my windows 7 installation.<br />

      <p class="post-content">sorry about the late reply!<br />
      uuum i think it might just be a few of us, the source is available for MD1 and some people use the Wii mote hack which is MD1, the current version (for the forseeable future) is the Milkdrop2 foler now though<br />
      <br />
      also on another note, while it does now install to MD2 itd be nice to install into the same directory that you select the presets from ie Milkdrop2/Username/Presets here rather that Milkdrop2/Presetname/Presets here</p>

      </blockquote>you can do that already by clicking the <i>Include Subfolders</i> checkbox. that way it will not use the pack's title as target folder, but replicate the file-structure you have chosen. however, this means you can't just select your user folder, because pimpbot replicates the file-structure <i>inside</i> that folder.<br />
      <br />
      btw, thanks for the input. i don't think many milkdrop artists are even aware something like pimpbot exists. good to have some feedback!<br />

      always the same - once i'm at it, i can't stop it. so here are some further improvements.<br />
      <br />
      as deviantart still renames .pimp files to .7z, i have decided to support opening .7z files with the runtime as well. also notable is the dropfolder improvement. you can now name your splash-screen something like #FF00FF.bmp (or just #F0F.bmp) and it will use that color as transparency key. however, this only works with the colours already supported (rgb + cmy)!<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>v3.6.5 "Earth Year" (2009-12-31)<br /> * Compiler: added DropFolder detection for splash-screen transparency key<br /> * Compiler: renamed some dialogs<br /> * Compiler: improved file-filters in some dialogs<br /> * Compiler: renamed bitmaps to support file-filters<br /> * RunTime: added support to install from .7z files<br /> * last distributions accidently shipped with outdated RunTime :)</code>

      if you're entire family likes to use pimpbot on the same computer, welcome the new multiuser support. however, like some other undocumented features, it needs to be enabled through the <i>pimpbot.ini</i>. though i doubt anyone really needs this :)<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>3.7 (2010-01-26)<br /> * Compiler: now works with multiuser settings<br /> * Compiler: switched to NewAdvSplash plugin (support for Bitmap, JPEG &amp; GIF)<br /> * Compiler: fixed a bug not copying default icons<br /> * Compiler: fixed bug when using background music<br /> * RunTime: fixed a bug when pack contain no subdirs<br /> * added and updated some scripts<br /> * fixed and improved the installer<br /> * updated default icon</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      the other big news concerns splash screens. while there is still no support for mp3 soundfiles (there are <a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/visualization/349229/" target="_blank">workarounds</a>), you can now use three kinds of images: jpeg, bitmap and gif.<br />

      tadaa! wasn't planned to release another pimpbot 3 version, but here is another major update. fixing some bugs, adding new features. i consider this a transition release on the way to 4.0!<br />
      <br />
      so, let's look at what has changed:<br />
      <br />
      -ape installation improved and simplified: no more dialogs, the installer should always make the right choice<br />
      -winamp3 support has been axed, no reason to keep it<br />
      -tighter dropbox integration<br />
      -runtime and backup now support alternate visualization directories and multiuser environments<br />
      -new scripts for power-users, including a new version of the migration script and another to compile many .pimp files into installers (that's useful if you want to update all your old installers at once)<br />
      -bugfixes, bugfixes, bugfixes<br />
