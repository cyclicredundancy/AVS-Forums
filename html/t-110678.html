      <p class="post-content">If you just put in an AVS file into it, it definately won't work (Obviously), because DVD players can't read softwares and don't have Winamp. I wonder what will happen if they CAN read AVS files...<br />

      <p class="post-content">i cant guarantee for good results, but the only possibility to get avs+music on a vcd/divx seems to be the following:<br />
      <br />
      1. get the <a href="http://acko.net/index.php?or=3" target="_blank">avs grabber</a> ape<br />
      2. create an avi file for your mix (mp3 or whatever)<br />
      3. get <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/" target="_blank">virtual dub</a><br />
      4. try to match both sound and video in vdub and save both in an mpeg or avi file<br />
      5. burn your (s)vcd or divx<br />
      <br />
      never tried it myself, but it seems to be the only possibility to do so. you will need a lot of diskspace for the uncompressed avi and it will be a bitch to sychronize sound and video (suggestion: use a single beat before playing the mix, this will be easy to spot in the avs <u>and</u> the soundfile).<br />
      <br />
      good luck! :D<br />
      <br />
      PS: check the resolution of standard (s)vcds and the best setting for a good perfomance in avs, you will most certainly have to resize the avi-output of your avs to match the vcd specs.</p>

      I created 3 VCD with AVS, here's what you need:<br />
      <br />
      2 PC (1 with video out and the other with video in)<br />
      the pc with video out need to have 2 graphics cards or 1 dual head<br />
      run avs in windowed+overlay mode , your overlay need to be on the card with tv-out<br />
      <br />
      acquire (sound+video so it'll be synched:)) with the "video in" PC<br />
      <br />
      burn with nero or any burning software that can make video CDs<br />
      <br />
      Et voila.....<br />
      <br />
      I hope you understand what I type, if no send private message and i'll try to explain in a better way</p>

      <br />
      Xion and everyone else: go to the website, click on the green square and the download links are there. The "print to video" ape is the one you want, but the movie loader is pretty good to.<br />
      <br />
      Once the ape is installed... well, just stick as the last item on the list. I think you'll agree the ape itself is pretty self explanatory (the video recorder anyway - the video player is complicated little beastie)<br />

      Hope that helps</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>vcd visualisations</strong><br />
      I have done this and played back on a 28 inch wide screen. Someone one on winamp faq suggested using a Desk top screen capture. I down loaded one called Hypercam. The tecnique works but the visual and sound quality left alot to be desired. Once the visual is captured it is saved as an avi file which can then be burned onto vcd using nero burning rom software. I only managed this two days ago and am still experimenting to enhance the quality.<br />
      Also a music software called Magix music maker 7 uses visuals with any music arranged on it which are much more manageble for converting to vcd. They arent as good as winamp avs visuals but you might wanto try it out. Good luck</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>vhs</strong><br />
      To record on VHS with your pc connected to the television seems alot easier and by plugging in my mic into the sound card I captured my voice as well as visualisations at the same time all on one tape. I had to buy two types of lead connections one for audio, onefor video and a svcd-scart adaptor. Also it's necessary that your graphics card has svc output or it might be called tv out(Im not that technical).<br />
      My graphics card is Nvidea geforce 4 if that helps. This is realy nice because I do poetry and can now record my poems with musical background and winamp visual effects for video playback.</p>

      La La Land by green velvet. I used camtasia screen capture to capture the AVS with the lyrics plugin. Truespace 6 to do the talking head and premiere to stitch it all together.<br />
      <br />
      File size is 6.4 megs, DIVX video and MP3 audio.<br />
      <br />
      I'm starting to find however that the lyrics plugin sort of sucks. There's another "free as in beer" program out there called sub station alpha.<br />
      <a href="http://www.eswat.demon.co.uk/substation.html" target="_blank">http://www.eswat.demon.co.uk/substation.html</a><br />
      That's designed to produce true karaoke lyrics (highlighted words, something lyricshow cannot do)<br />
      Basically you would use SSA to produce a script which will produce the on screen lyrics when fed through this virtual dub filter.<br />

      I think it would be cool to make an AVS preset out of the words... that maybe really hard but I'm sure that if you had the time (if i had a few spare weeks I'd do it) you could make an AVS preset which goes with one song which does the lyrics and music and can do clever things with the words like make them spin in 3d to the music and morph in and out of one another... etc.

      Ive done my first vhs as a test. Avs will play through my tv in full screen mode and in colour but i found if I wanted to record full screen in colour I had to go into full screen "first" and then hit record with my video remote. So idealy my first track had to have a gap at the begining to give me time to hit full screen pick up the remote and press record. Also make sure that you computer is either close to the tv and video or that your connection leads are long enough. I had to go for 10 meter leads because my computers at one end of my room and the tv's at the other end. I'd be happy to hear if it worked.</p>
