      <p class="post-content"><strong>I need YOU.. again!</strong><br />
      Yep, the time is approaching when I will be releasing another AVS pack. So I would like to once again call upon you all to give me a little help, I really like remixes and I really like the community so I would like to ask you to make me some remixes for my upcomping pack. It won't be out for a while yet (two weeks plus) but I thought that it would be better to give you all tons of time to make stuff, especially since some of you are busy with your own packs and other projects.<br />
      <br />
      I've zipped up three random presets from my pack for you to play with. I would like to see some remixes of my other work (pack 6, pack 5 etc...) to add some variety, but I don't mind if you only use these. There is also an unfinished preset on deviantART, which I am still working on but could be used as a basis for a remix, you can find that here:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/813944" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/813944</a><br />
      <br />
      If I like you enough I can send you, by email (not through the forums for obvious reasons), some more presets to work with if you totally dislike these ones.<br />
      <br />
      There will be some quality control done by me, I will probably only add the best &lt;insert random number here&gt; presets to the pack.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.</p>

      I still have 7 more presets to make so remember there is not a huge rush. Especially since I just got a job so I'm going to have even less time to work on my AVS presets. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks. I'm going to be building and testing computers for the next week, maybe even more if I'm lucky... *and* I'll be getting paid to do it (its almost a dream come true :)). Next I need to find a job where I can make AVS for a living. :p<br />
      <br />
      I just got another preset finished up so I've got 6 left now.<br />
      <br />
      Please keep the remixes coming (I'm secretly hoping that many of you have got some killer plans for some of my stuff). If you want any more material to work with just give me an e-mail and I can send you some more J7 presets.</p>

      Just for the record anyone can remix my presets for their own packs or can steal large chunks of presets to build there own. If there is a large amount of preset being copied then I'd like some credit.<br />
      <br />
      I'll make some kind of comment in my next pack intro adressing this I think.</p>

      Thank you for all of the contributions... expect the pack to be released next week, maybe even this Sunday if I'm felling nifty. (equally likely to be next Sunday though)<br />

      Expect 20 original presets and a shit ton of remixes.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Where to bein with whats wrong here? Let's see...<br />
      <br />
      1.) My pack was released a while ago. (check the dates of posts in future)<br />
      2.) You removed the alpha blending from the preset, which made it look like poo in the distance.<br />
      <br />
      Sorry, but thats the way it is. My next pack isn't near completion yet and I probably won't be having remixes for it so you'll have to wait for Pack 9 now... hmm pack 9 &lt;-&gt; PAK-9, that gives me an idea... bye!</p>

      But seriously, J, that "poo in the distance" is meant to be there - it's a static haze (static as in 'snow on a TV set' static, not static as in stationary), as if whatever is scanninng the tunnel can't penetrate, as if it's being jammed by electronic countermeasures.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>That's the point, Atero...</strong><br />
      Static isn't supposed to look good, it's supposed to deceive. Especially ECM static - that stuff, if it were given a visible form, would probably look butt-ugly.<br />
      <br />
      Still, perhaps I could tweak the static a bit...make it look lress poo-like... :P</p>

      <p class="post-content">As I said in the post before yours, Atero, it still needs a bit of tweaking. I'm trying to figure out a way for the static not to be so ugly. Perhaps if I could turn it into floating shapes that occlude each other and the end of the tunnel....that might work.<br />
