      I don't know about "recommended",<br />
      <br />
      Depending on what you want to do, there's a setup for you. If you want to do this as your main source of income, you've gotta start looking at what other [pro's are using. But if it's just for fun, you have more options. I've seen Avs's done on everything from professional quality projectors to 27 inch television sets. While it's best to have a projector for obvious reasons, they're pretty expensive, so you might want to shop around a bit.<br />
      <br />
      Personally I use my Athlon 850, with a 3d prophet II MX 32 (AGP), and an ATI Mach 64 TV-OUT 8mb, (PCI) as the graphics cards. This gives me two desktops so I can manipulate the avs's live and displaythemm only in a "fullscreen" 640x480 window, so they run even smoother and faster.<br />
      <br />
      One last thing. You're gonna have to get some line input! I made myself a 100 foot long shielded RCA to Stereo jack cord to get it. However, at my first gig, the dj messed up the mixer and I wasn't getting a signal. I had tojury-rig a microphone, which worked pretty well. You can decide which works better for you.<br />
      <br />
      good luck</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey transfrmr, you sound like you have some experience with this. I am trying to figure out how to output the AVS screens out to TV on a dual display card, but the trick would be to keep the AVS window small on the primary display (thus keeping them really fast) and somehow send that signal out to the secondary display as full screen only. I emailed matrox and ati tech support about this but they only support this "feature" fir DVD playback. You think I may have better chances using two seperate video cards rather than one dual display card ?...<br />
      <br />
      TIA</p>

      <p class="post-content">That's what I do..<br />
      <br />
      If you have an AGP and PCI video slot, it's easy as pie..<br />
      <br />
      I actually run Avs in a window on the secondary display (adjusted so you can't see the borders), and overlay it onto the main monitor so it runs fast and I can monitor my output. I can open the Config menu onto the main desktop for live manipulation or to change random directories. Heck, at one point I was even playing solitaire while I had the AVS's on random cycle... :)<br />
      <br />
      As for doing this with one card, I've heard others have had the same difficulties. Using the two cards, it was all plug &amp; play...</p>

      <p class="post-content">I use a Matrox G450 Dual Head. Make sure that DVD Max is on and your not using multi display. In the AVS editor select Overlay mode , Set desktop to color and set the color to be the same as your desktop (I use black). You should see your output on both your primary screen and the second port going to a tv/monitor. I set the color one off of black IE 0,0,1 insted of 0,0,0 pure black. I find that the avs background can make reading your screen difficult. If any one wants to know how to make the output go to the second display without showing on the main at all just say so.</p>

      Noizze,<br />
      <br />
      What resolution are you running the AVS files at ? Can you set different resolution on each monitor ? You mentioned ovarlay mode, but making the avs windows full size (so at least 640x480) would make them slow no ? Can you provide some more details on your setup ?<br />
      TIA!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>transfrmr re: dual cards</strong><br />
      Which card is your primary (avs) card ? The agp or the PCI ? It might be a problem to get any decent PCI video cards these days... I assume you run the AVS-running display in low-res and you kind'a maximize the AVS window ? Hmm sounds intewresting I'd love to hear some details. How is the performance ? how many fps @ what size can you get?<br />
      <br />
      TIA!</p>

      I just re-read your post, yes how do you make the second display show only avs and not the config/desktop ? Sounds just like what I was looking for!<br />

      <p class="post-content">If you are getting a desktop on the second output then you have Multi-Display active. You want to select the Clone and DVD Max button. Then check the use DVD Max box. That should do it. If that seems confusing then let me know what driver you are using (I use 5.52) and what your OS is.</p>
