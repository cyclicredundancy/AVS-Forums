I assume you mean 3-d projections or slices of regular polytopes. If you want to make the 4-d ones that would be some cool code, if you make the projection code I'd gladly supply the coordinates for the 4d polytopes - in terms of phi naturally. In higher dimesions (5+) though the only polytopes that exist are the analogues of the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron which are pretty easy to get the co-ords for (mostly using 1's and 0's).<br><br>I did my first year essay on regular 4d polytopes (polychora), and defined them all in it, I was dead chuffed at the time (now I regret it because I could have done an essay on the maths of AVS instead - it was to simple for year two so I cant use it for this year either :( ). The 24-cell (icosikaitetrachoron) was the hardest to figure out since it has no analog in 3-space and it is self dualling so it can't be derived from the other shapes.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd September 2002 21:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">4-d, yes.

Take a 4-cube and stick it through our 3-d space. The part that's on the 'surface' of our space is the part that we see.
