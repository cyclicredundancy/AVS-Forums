It installs both the bold and normal version of it.<br><br>- I think the presets are still pretty non-epileptic, but you could always add motion blur if you wanted. Oh and changing the buffer-restore in psychobutterfly from XOR to Additive makes it a lot smoother.<br><br>- Jello Cube: add channelshift for more different colours :)<br><br>- Radiant: strange, no-one seems to like this preset. I love it :weird:<br><br>- Use the force: the ship isn't supposed to hit things but the prediction isn't perfect. It can't be going inside the floor, it's probably the non-perspectiveness of 3D DM's that's screwing up the perspective up close. Making presets like this is not easy... can't believe you gave it less than psychobutterly btw.<br><br>- Circuit City: actually there are 5 objects and variations of chips (pins on 4 sides or pins on 2 sides).

The friendly people at URW++ granted me a sponsored license for Eurostile, in return for a short mention of them in the readme file. Check their <a href="http://www.urwpp.de/english/home.html" target="_blank">Website</a> if you're interested in fonts, they're really friendly as opposed to most companies that have anything to do with copyright :rolleyes:.<br><br>I submitted an updated version with the new info, in case you're wondering why it's disappeared from Winamp.com again.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">EnDurA</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th December 2002 07:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">hey Uncloned thanks 4 the great AVS packs.

If it weren't, the bottom row of glowing lights wouldn't go from center to bottom-left/bottom-right, but they would point slightly upwards on the outside. The camera is very *close* to the bottom, but it's not below it. If it were, you'd see nothing but the floor and not the sides of the canyon (plus any superscopes of course).<br><br>Since the glowing lights represent the sides, there's nothing wrong with the perspective and I have no idea why you're complaining. And I already said that if it bothers you, you can edit the -0.29 value to something closer to zero in the DM code.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">VisualAgnosia</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2002 03:39 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">not to mention you'd get ripped into little bits and have cleaner droids have to clean up bits of your brains, after you yell "ahhhhhh I'm going down"<br><br>:igor:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2002 19:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ahh okie...But still it does go down there and STICKS to the bottom.

The camera's movement goes below the floor before being clipped, which causes it to 'stick' to the bottom. I thought it was neat.
