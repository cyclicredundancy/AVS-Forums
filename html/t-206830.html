      <p class="post-content"><strong>hey everyone</strong><br />
      LOL forums have changed so much since I've checked in. I just wanted to let you all know I'm working for a mobile disk jockey company called The Wave. It is quite an amazing production (a killer light &amp; sound show...at a student council convention he had 8 cerwin vega earthquake speakers, like 6 JBL concert speakers---well over $100,000 worth of sound &amp; lights, not to mention 2 HUGE video projection screens (I know they were at least 15 feet). I was not with the company at the time---it was before I started. My job is to run the video/visuals---and I'd been trying to talk to my boss about using AVS instead of windows media player visuals...and he's the sort that is always hesitant to try new stuff b/c it might screw up the old stuff or somethin...that was early on in my work with the comapny, but after a little while he decided to put me in charge of video etc. at our larger shows (well for weddings, a huge video screen projecting AVS doesn't quite fit lol)...anyways the other weekend I worked a large show &amp; did video. Let me say that my boss is not one to give complements hardly at all--for the most part he's critical of most stuff.<br />
      <br />
      anyways he calls me with some ideas &amp; stuff he wants me to work on &amp; he's like hey sorry I didn't get to tell you sooner, you know how busy we all were at the show &amp; how tired we were when we got back...but I saw what you had going on the screen...and that was quite impressive. :D Well I couldn't help but notice all the girls who wanted to take a picture in front of the video screen (we were reverse projecting it...from behind the screen; it's a dual-surface one so it shows on both sides).<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, I haven't been in for a while, but if anybody's got a collection of nice VJ presets I could use, I'd most appreciate it.<br />
      <br />
      I suppose I could say I'm a VJ now :D<br />
      <br />
      I'm out<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Peace</p>

      i've made some presets myself, but i'd understand if you didn't want to use them.<br />
      I'd look on deviantart.com for more artists. Most of the people here hace accounts there.</p>

      <p class="post-content">What specifically makes an AVS good for VJ'ing? Lots of my presets have mouse control in them which I'd imagine is a bit of a no-no, but of course you can use my presets if you want. 99% of people are happy for you to show their work at parties and gigs because thats a lot of the point of AVS.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Pak 9 posses a good question. To the shows I've been to that use visuals, they are all looking more for the good scenes and whatnot that actually have little response to the music.<br />

      Then again, I've been to clubs that use some sort of responsive visualization.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea that would like great, a big 100ft screen with a visualisation running and slowly an interactivity menu fades into view becuase they moved the mouse. You can try and make it so that mouse control stuff doesnt appear in fullscreen but there is not robust solution to that problem.</p>

      <br />
      this is also uber usefull if you are to lazy to code your own ui:D + the settings get saved with the preset:)<br />
