I think you're cool.. but reading on DA lately and now this made me feel I'm getting one of the few these days. :igor:<br><br>And why that is.. I have a ltiile theory of my own..<br>When you start AVS'ing, you can do all kinds of stuff that looks great.. in your eyes... So you visit the community. There you're being cracked down, in order to learn coding and not doing the so-called n00b stuff that you've been doing and you really love. So you slowly start learning to code and create your old ideas that you've felt you could never do. When you've created such a great preset, someone else makes a great preset that totally blows you away. So you have to study on, because you want to be good. Now you <b>should</b> say to yourself: Hey! I don't need only that! style and looks are mofe important that that! but since there's no progress in &gt;learning&lt; how to create a good-looking color-combinations, at least not for your mind, you continue to work on your code, in which will be disappointed time after time because there is always some-one better. That gives you the feeling that you suck. Sure you make good looking stuff, but there's always that little voice telling you that you <i>could</i> do better. So there you are on the point that, even while creating the best presets on the planet, you still think you suck.<br><br>My advice: fuck that feeling (sorry to sound harsh). Be satisfied with what you make, even if you know you can do better. What you make is what you make. No more, no less. everybody has this feeling sometime. (at least I do.)<br><br>(All above is not personally @Deamon but in general)<br><br><br>So.. you're leaving.. I'm sad right now, but goodbye. :cry:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2004 01:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't really think i suck at avs, I love the things I make. It's just that for my feeling, I can't make my stuff right anymore. I can't get anything out of my hands. it just doesn't do it anymore. I dunno how come, but I hope someday it'll return and I make presets again.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Shock Value</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2004 03:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I think the reason that so many people stop AVSing isn't so much from the fact that there are so many great artists that make better stuff than their own. I think the reason is that AVSers (and any artist of any medium really) feel that they need to top themselves on each preset they make, which results in a lot more time spent on each preset. So despite the fact that their presets are continuing to look better and better, it's taking them a much longer time to put them together, a factor that outweighs the quality of their work in their mind and causes them to stop making presets. I think that's happening to me, actually. :) So don't expect too much (if any) AVS from me in the near future. (Although I have some other ongoing projects at DeviantArt that I am working on now and plan to complete.)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Dragon-Dreams</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th July 2004 07:09 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I think it's something to do with AVS artists thinking of AVS as being on par with writing music.

And it seems these days people seem to be more impressed by mindless complexity than by beauty. People make countless threads about 'who makes the most technical AVS' but I see none like, 'who makes the most beautiful visuals'.<br>I loved the AVS of artists like Duo, not because they were technical, but because they were incredibly lovely to watch. He was a true master.<br><br>4. The lack of support for small time AVSers on the forums.<br>I constantly asked for help, and only a handful of people took any notice when I asked for some remixes. If people told me there was nothing they could do, that would be better than simply ignoring it. This may seem selfish, but it is annoying when no one will help you out.
