I actually hope that they end up recoding the entire thing. It will render old presets worthless but it will open up new doors for better and more advanced presets. I doubt they will change major things like the way trig works into things though so i don't think we'll have to relearn most of the basic fundamentals behind the coding for things. But in the end who knows, we'll just have to wait and see.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd April 2003 20:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Lets place bets.
