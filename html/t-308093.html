      <p class="post-content"><strong>Old school "standard' presets not working</strong><br />
      I have been off the avs scene for quite a while, so I'm sure there have been changes I'm not aware of. In the presets that come with the full installed newest version of Winamp. there are quite a few presets that don't work. For instance, s_kupers 'revenge of mt doom' Shows the base grid, which is responsive to beat but it is not rendering the SS. There are lots of other examples; some just show a black screen, in others no scopes are being rendered, just movement and effects work correctly. Still others completely crash Winamp.<br />
      <br />
      I doubt anyone remembers me, but I have made a few presets in avs before, and I am familiar with the "standard" presets by all the pioneers (such as elvis and nemoorange), and they aren't working correctly. Is this perhaps not having a specific APE, or trying to load a preset with a non-operational APE? Either way, shouldnt the newest version of winamp auto install the APEs needed, or are all the presets subject to "broken" scopes? (Perhaps the mathematics in some scopes aren't written exactly "up to code" so to speak?)<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and I have gone into the editor and tried adding or removing effects to 'broken' presets, and it changes nothing.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks so much for any help! :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, pak put a project up on google code (where the link is) you can get it with svn... unfortunately it has large prerequisites in the form of SDL (which depends on the enormous DirectX SDK - hence I am yet to even build it [i have no regular computer/internets to make 700MB downloads with]).<br />
      <br />
      If you haven't used SVN before I'd strongly recommend using <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Tortoise SVN</a>. It integrates with windows explorer so you can right click and empty folder and do an svn checkout from the repository.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fridgescript/" target="_blank">FridgeScript</a> is fun though... but of course i would say that, i made it. its complete enough to use, but is still missing function calls. it beats the crap out of evallib though... aside from the lack of testing on a large number of machines.<br />
      <br />
      this makes me realise i should do something to get it to auto-generate some kind of source zip/rar something on every revision... there are rss feeds for the project updates that could be used to trigger it and submit, with the comments containing some code to prevent a deadly loop of infinite svn commits.<br />
      <br />
      google code is great in that they provide free hosting, but the rest of the service is decidedly mediocre.<br />
      <br />
      if you are interested i can add you into the project(s). unfortunately i'm not able to do much work on them at the moment, hence the complete standstill on fridge/fridgescript/fsassembler atm... the last opportunity i had i wasted making yet another opengl framework (gltoy on google code).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Fridge has actually progressed since my last post! PAK and myself have been doing some pair programming... and PAK stuck a text renderer and some nicer buttons in last night too from what I can see of updates on the repository.<br />
      <br />
      BTW, if you let me know your google account e-mail address I'll add you to the project as QA or something so you can post comments and report issues etc. if you get stuck getting it to work or if you find any bugs etc... we have missed.</p>
