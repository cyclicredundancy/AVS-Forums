      <p class="post-content">That happened to me a couple of times. The closest solution I found is to use a resource hacker to move the remove button all the way to the right. I then made a new menu "New Preset" and put "New" under it. This way, it is very hard to slip.</p>

      <br />
      there is NO WAY that avs can lose 17 presets by crashing. if you saved one and moved on then it's on the hard disk and it's staying there until you fuck with it. if you did lose all of those presets then you should plan on getting a new hdd cos it's deteriorating, and badly.</p>

      </blockquote>Hotlist does nothing to bitmaps except to those within the Hotlist/Pictures Folder. And those may be uninstalled too.<br />
      But the uninstaller wont take any of your avs pictures.<br />
      <br />
      I scripted it with NSIS, so maybe this is a NSIS bug, but not my fault then.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, i'd like you to test this once again. Any Bug report may help in further developement.<br />

      <p class="post-content">It's not that I enjoy annoying you.. it's your "holier than thou" additude that got you annoyed over insufnificant bullshit that had nothing to do with thead to begin with. with that additude you'll be one with hard life... so just sit back and enjoy being annoyed or help folks... the choice is yours</p>
