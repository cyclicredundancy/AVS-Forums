      Basicly, I'm part of the way through "kar-ma - Whack A N00b", a AVS Game (code the coding/gameplay base down, am working on graphics) and I need n00bis presets for the whack A noobs to throw at you, and kill you (blank White boxes just arent the same) I dont want to hurt people (and rip from them) by placing real presets in it, So I call upon everyone to give me presets to use (I can't make flashy kalidoscopic presets, SERIOUSLY! They WONT FLASH!!!) If I get a couple i'll show you's</p>

      <br />
      it should read:<br />
      do you need permission for using <b>presets</b> or permission for using <b>pictures</b> of presets?<br />

        <b>HYPNOTIC TUNNEL</b> - meh, again with the same colours but it looks way to grainy, i would smoothen it out and make the scopes into something different. This is essentially, a very very noob preset. Also dont use roto blitters like that. <font color="red">2.0/5.0</font><br />
        <b>LIGHTFORMING</b> - this also has been done waaay too many times. the blue is too bright for my taste and it looks too grainy. <font color="red">2.6/5.0</font><br />
        <b>PHSYCOPOD</b> - meh, grainy, sunburster, noob colours. i like that cirles effect though, put it onto something better. change the colours and get rid of that god forsaken sunburster. <font color="red">2.0/5.0</font><br />
        <b>ROTORIX</b> - gah, my eyes!!! it burns.. it buhuhurns!!! change it so its not so grainy and chaotic. Make the colours less bright and make it change direction, also try and make it so you cant see those ugly lines you get with a roto blitter at the edges where its rotating. <font color="red">2.2/5.0</font>

      <p class="post-content">Why thank you JFASI, I would've loved to say that your sucks ass too, but it's too classy for the average noob. You obviously haven't seen as much of them as I have (and I've seen all that were released on winamp.com in the last, what, 2 years. And at least 60% of them before.<br />
      <br />
      Let's see. For proper noobness, you shouldnt've used wrap, despite the name of the movement clearly saying that you should use it. And there should be at least 3 of them. Preferably all over the preset, but "in a row" is nice. One of them should be "source map", and one of them should have "rectangular coordinates" unclicked. Cos you don't want a square preset. Duh. Changing the angle of the Dot Fountain is for wimps and pussies. Keeping the original colours was correct though. Those new apes are for pussies too. On beat, on CS is nice though, but Multi Filter HAS to be on beat too ! And in the beginning of the preset. So that you have a nice triple chrome all over your preset. Additive blend is the n00bs friend too. It can't be shiny enough.<br />

    I dunno. Are we trying to make n00b presets from the standpoint of technical n00bishness, or do they just have to look like crap? I think the holy grail would be to get both.<br />

        <p class="post-content">JFASI, there are two types of n00b AVS. The "minimalist crap", and the "bloated crap". The minimalist crap is produced by the sort of n00bs who are really n00bs. Like, seen avs 2 days ago. For the 95% of them, that's the first moving thing they've "created" on their pc's, and because it's, like, a "cool animation", they love it. It's obviously crap, really simplistic crap, but <i>they</i>'ve made it and they're proud of it. The "bloated crap" is made by the more ambitious among the n00b n00bs, and by people who have been doing AVS for a little longer. 50% n00b n00bs evolve into that category after a few months, 45% stop doing avs, and 5% do something that resembles "good presets". The bloated crap, which is the preset I've put above consists of a bunch of generic movements, or simply crappy movements (making a x=0, y=cos(2) movement, without the rectangular coordinates makes them proud), irregularly dispersed through the preset, often repeating themselves, some slightly "tweaked" effects, like, say, Blitter Feedback, or Interferences. Unmodified DDMs are also present. The lower the FPS, the better the preset looks to them (if it's slow, it MUST be good!1!!). XOR is also often used, as soon as they discover Effect Lists. Text is used in the most brutal way, and so is Bump. Most of the l33t hax0r n00bs are devout bloatedcrapians. The "mix" in my attachment goes beyond the two styles. Simple enough to be the first style, with the elements of the second style.<br />

        </blockquote>If talking a bit more about n00bs, there are so n00bs that aren't n00bs, they make presets that aren't presets*. Those n00bs never publish presets, never visit forums: they hide.<br />
        *Not like this, although they are similar in methods.<br />
        This is just a very simple preset.
