There's a problem with the projector and we can't find a new one. Try as we might, it just didn't happen, so we ended up using a 27 inch Tv, not quite the same, but at least I got to show off my work anyways.<br><br>Then, I had a 100foot rca-stereo jack line to give me a line in feed from the DJ's. Everything worked great, untill someone messed with the mixer and I was only getting part of the signal. It's hard to get your visualisations to beat-match when you're not getting the bass. Luckily I had a fall back plan, even though I really wasn't sure if it would work. I hooked up my mike (fairly decent quality) to the putor, and got an excellent sound feed from it. I really didn't think it would work, but it picked up the sound perfectly. All I had todowss tweak thelevels a bit to get rid of the distortion. After this experiene, I'm starting to wonder if maybe I should forget the line-in approach and invest in a different (aka=better) mike and work it that way.<br><br>I did have one small problem. The beat-detection messed up a couple of times, and wouldn't follow the music from the mike input at all. I managed to kick-start it into working by playing a track from the playlist then switching bak to theline-input suddenly. I'm trying to figure outhow to et rid of that for the next time, if anyone has any ideas, I'd be happy to hear em.<br><br>Also, since I planned on using the line-in I didn't even bother looking, but is there a specific command for mic-in? I tried a few but couldn't find one, then I realised I could get it to work with the line -input command. So I guess, it does the same thing anyways.<br><br><br>I got great respose to the display itself, and have been approached about doing more events, so things are looking good.<br><br>I still want to find my own projector, but the show must go on nonetheless..</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bluetape2k1</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th October 2001 18:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Top one</strong><br>I'm glad your gig went well<br><br>One question......how many buckets of your sweat collected :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">WolfieD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th October 2001 19:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">nice job, man... good thing you had enough smarts to do those workarounds.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">transfrmr</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th October 2001 19:08 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Right on target...</strong><br>Sweat was definitely a factor...<br><br><br>Untill everything was up and running, I think there were about four buckets.<br><br>Once it was going on, I was set up beside a door, purposefully so i could open it and cool the room down a bit if things were getting too drippy for my CPU.. worked like a charm...<br><br>One guy was interesting though. In th morning ht ethanked me for playing the music all night.. I gues he didn't notice the DJ's who took up the other side of the room.

I predesigned a few presets that could be tweaked live to generate different effects. Plus I plyed throught some that I had already made whenever I was bored. It's real easy to make a preset that can be manipulated a lot during a live set. I made about thirty of those and had all ofthe presets from my packs. I also used some presets from blurpack 4 and scarface and flatmatt. I'd be into using more people's presets, variety's great, but I want people's permission first.<br><br>If you want your preset pack used for visuals, let me know and I'll use what I can.<br><br>One good thing though, I've been guaranteed a projetor for the next gig... as a matter of fact they reserved it today... :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">LittleBuddy88</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th October 2001 16:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Heh, I think that most people would be proud to have their presets used at Gigs and similar. at least I know I would. ;)<br>Good luck to ya with the new projector!<br><br><br>Linus</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">bluetape2k1</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th October 2001 01:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>:)</strong><br>So the royalites :)<br><br>I'd like a full log from your computer detailing what presets were used and if possible, highlighting the presets I designed.<br><br>I charge on a sliding scale so the more of my presets you used, the less each one will cost but I also take into account the amount of time the visualisation was displayed.<br><br>Please also note that there is a minimum charge of £1 (or $1.45) for each preset of mine selected.
