      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 4</strong><br />
      over the last two weeks, i have taken the early pimpbot ui concept and added some functionality. the result is the first <i>alpha</i> version of pimpbot 4. it probably would deserve being called a beta instead, as it runs very stable. however, as long as not all of the features are implemented -you can currently only make avs installers- it will remain alpha.<br />
      <br />
      <b>so what's new</b>?<br />
      -new ui: more responsive and more intelligent, should help you making any mistakes<br />
      -multiple instances will not interfere with each other (not that anybody should need this)<br />
      -if compilation fails, you can simply go back and fix your settings without the need to re-open pimpbot<br />
      -more apes supported<br />
      -more reliable ape detection<br />
      -some texer packs were included<br />
      -updated installer script<br />
      <br />
      support for other plugins will follow, i also plan to add a completely new script for installers.<br />
      <br />
      <b>requirements</b>:<br />
      -nsis 2.42 (or later)<br />
      -pimpbot 3.8.3 (only for now - to ensure you have all necessary files installed)<br />
      <br />
      if you run into <i>bugs</i> or want to leave any sorts of feedback, please do so in this thread!<br />

      <br />
      <b>whats new?</b><br />
      -replaced ape detection (<i>much</i> faster)<br />
      -ui is more responsive<br />

      The first beta basically brings almost full functionality compared to the 3.x versions. You can now create installers for AVS, MilkDrop and SPS presets, open and create <i>.pimp</i> files, use <a href="http://vimeo.com/8446980" target="_blank">DropFolder</a> and a bunch of other things.<br />
      <br />
      There are still a bunch of minor glitches, but room for improvement is primarily under the hood. PimpBot 4 should make it a lot easier to create installers.<br />
      <br />
      I have only created a very feature limited installer, which uses a different install path than Pimpbot 3.x - so you can have both at the same time.<br />

      <p class="post-content">couldnt post earlier, but shortly after my last post i noticed the dropdown menu for <i>all</i> will remain empty when trying to load a previous pack.<br />
      <br />
      for now you can fix this by <a href="http://7-zip.org" target="_blank">unzipping</a> the attached file to your pimpbot beta installation path.<br />
      <br />
      open the file and edit the value for <i>PimpDir</i> - any valid path will do.</p>

      <p class="post-content">i uploaded a new beta, mainly to fix some of the glitches mentioned above. it also has some new features, you can save default data sets into a file called <i>defaults.ini</i> (App Data\PimpBot). all included programs will run in multiuser environment by default (this can be tweaked though).<br />
      <br />
      for future releases, i'm going to review the ape install routines (and channelshift's behaviour). there will also be a cheatsheet option for autocompletion of your website (type <i><a href="http://visbot.net" target="_blank">http://visbot.net</a></i> to the url-field to see how it works!)<br />
      <br />
      another thing i have to look into is pimpbot's multi-language option, which is currently the only feature working in the ui that doesn't apply changes to your installer. i might post some language files i need translated, hope you guys can help.<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm not numbering the betas anymore, but i have uploaded several new versions since my last post. the new version should install apes correctly and fixes some minor glitches regarding ui consistency. a major update has come to the installer, which now includes a dialog to specify your preferred <i>.pimp</i> file directory. it also integrates fully into an existing <a href="http://db.tt/vZmNPC2" target="_blank">dropbox</a> installation.<br />

      <p class="post-content">another update! did some housekeeping and brought back some of the commandline switches (<i>pimpbot.exe /?</i> for details.) oh, and there was a bug with texer2 in the <i>.pimp</i> file creation.<br />

      as much as i see it, the pimpbot compiler is now feature-complete. next up i'm going to work on the installscript and on the runtime.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>pre-final gossip</strong><br />
      So, the news is that beta4 of PimpBot 4.0 will be the final version! In the last couple of days, I've added more features, improved some code and tested it heavily. The <a href="http://pimpbot.googlecode.com" target="_blank">project pages</a> are growing on information, basically putting the manual online.<br />
      <br />
      <b>New features since the last beta?</b><br />
      -added pre-compiler to test interface components for validity<br />
      -added a fuzzy-mode for <a href="http://vimeo.com/8446980" target="_blank">DropFolder</a>, respectively called <a href="http://vimeo.com/18297264" target="_blank">FuzzyDrop</a><br />
      -added support for alternative UIs<br />
      -added new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/wiki/CommandlineParameters" target="_blank">commandline switches</a><br />
      -added chinese translation<br />
      -fixed some GUI inconsistencies<br />
      -improved install script<br />
      -upgraded 3rd party components<br />
      <br />
      <b>What's missing?</b><br />
      -new default UI, will be added in 4.1<br />
      -support for other Winamp plugins, will be added in 4.1<br />
      <br />
      <b>How can <i>you</i> help?</b><br />
      Apart from testing all the features thoroughly, you can submit a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showpost.php?p=2723394&amp;postcount=13" target="_blank">translation</a> of the installer script<br />
      <br />
      <b>When will it be available?</b><br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 4.1</strong><br />
      Four months after the initial release of the 4.x-series, here's the first new major version. As promised, it now features the support to create installers for any Winamp plugin. The installers might not be as perfected as those for AVS or MilkDrop, but they should work for most cases.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Whats New?</b><br />
      - update notifications<br />
      - support for any Winamp plugin<br />
      - more consistent interface<br />

      Already working on 4.2, which should introduce the long-promised new installer interface. As a step towards that, you can already disable the the components selection dialogue in latest release. With the improvements in APE installation over the last couple of releases, I find it unnecessary to present that option to the end-user.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 4.1.5 &amp; PimpBot 4.2 beta</strong><br />
      Uh-oh, I've noticed a severe bug in the APE detection that slipped in with version 4.0.1 already. It's been fixed in version <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.1.5-setup.exe" target="_blank">4.1.5</a> alongside another bug in a feature that nobody ever used (classic UI, opposed to the default <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Modern%20UI/Readme.html" target="_blank">Modern UI</a>). In any case you should update and if you've used the APE detection recently, you should rebuild your installers using the new version.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks to QOAL's amazing new <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showpost.php?p=2761323&amp;postcount=25" target="_blank">plugin</a>, PimpBot <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.2b-setup.exe" target="_blank">4.2</a> will introduce the detection for resource files (images, videos etc.) - probably the last feature most of you have been missing. I've also refined the update check and I still plan to implement the long-announced new installer interface and an improved (slimmer) setup.<br />

      <font size="6"><b>IMPORTANT UPDATE</b></font><br />
      <br />
      Alright, I'm sure you ran into a comment about your installer being a virus, trojan or any other kind of possible malware. I've investigated a little and found that the Upack header compression is the only reason that produces these false positives. So, I've decided to switch for UPX compression. This means that installers will be slightly bigger (we're talking about 3kb here, so nobody will care), but the problem with false positives should be reduced dramatically.<br />
      <br />
      I've uploaded the same installer with different types of compression to VirusTotal, here are the results for <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=4a677d6fac2354f4075d236d69df06ff9d7935d016d49e98ea5747b8505913da-1302519359" target="_blank">UPX</a> and <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=5f5c75ad44f805168c4de5174dc4cd48a9fc47f47d277947fcce19c156597e94-1302519019" target="_blank">Upack</a> compression and <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d69f6ebc89f018a860e8820533f53887d1153c8f29adc5bf841aee4ed7555313-1302519319" target="_blank">without</a> any header compression.<br />
      <br />
      <b>In other words: UPGRADE!</b><br />
      <br />
      There were also a couple of other changes:<br /></p>
      <pre>
<code> * Compiler: added support for UVS resource files<br /> * Compiler: improved subfolder detection for preset files<br /> * Compiler: increased tolerance on missing components<br /> * Compiler: modified components checker<br /> * Backup: switched default header compression to UPX<br /> * modified install script debugger<br /> * switched default header compression to UPX<br /> * fixed a bug in uninstaller</code>

      for the wise of you that have migrated their plugins dir into userspace, installers created with the latest beta no longer require admin privileges - same goes for pimpbot runtime. the majority still using the default avs location will have to live with installers requiring admin rights.<br />
      <br />
      also updated some this &amp; that (tm), refer to the changelog for all changes.<br />
      <br />
      beta 4 is likely the last beta before the final release, grab it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.2b4-setup.exe" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 4.2 FINAL</strong><br />
      At last, the final version of PimpBot 4.2 is here. It's the first version that feels feature-complete and not only by 4.x standards - the new version has all the features I ever imagined. A big thanks goes once again to QOAL, without whom's help there wouldn't be that new "Magic" button, a scanner for all required files (Texer images, videos, GVM etc.)<br />
      <br />
      The final version also features a working version of that long announced user interface, though that still needs some work in detail.<br />
      <br />
      Another nice feature, is the previously mentioned possibility to run installers in user-mode, though that requires the user to have his Winamp plugin directory in user-space as well. Fortunately, you can use PimpBot's own migrator to do just that for you. This and other tools came with previous version of PimpBot, but for the very first time you can compile them directly from the (new) installer.<br />
      <br />
      For the next versions, I've only got plans for the install script. Mainly I'm trying to make the source more readable and I'm improving some things on the new interface. Until the, have fun with Pimpbot 4.2!<br />

      <p class="post-content">Okay, I'm confused.<br />
      <br />
      I've just had a little play with 4.2 and it seems to copy <i>every</i> (selected) resource file type in the resource folder, not what avstools (sh|w)ould return, so you get huge pile of files in the installer. :S<br />
      <br />
      Am I doing something wrong? (Or am I missing this 'Magic' button?)<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Also for the actual pimpbot installer, the default path for the AVS dir is "C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins\avs", which is wrong for me -- does it not auto detect it's location?</p>

      </blockquote>folder detection works in this order:<br />
      <br />
      1. get winamp installation path from registry<br />
      2. read winamp.ini for VISDir (D:\Anywhere\You\Want\..\avs)<br />
      3. if VISDir is empty, use default structure based on installation path (/Plugins/avs)<br />
      4. if all above fails, use default dir ($PROGRAMFILES\Winamp\Plugins\avs)<br />
      <br />
      most of the time #4 fails is when people have copied their old winamp installation over the years, probably even using a different drive or directory name. if the winamp installation is proper, there should be no problem (verified using 2.9 and 5.5)

      a new version is out now, fixing some bugs with certain characters in filenames. also added more texer resources, improved the new installer ui and the pimpbot installer itself. unfortunately the automatic dropbox detection is no longer working when using the latest version of dropbox, this will hopefully be fixed in the next release. of course you can always specify your dropbox directory manually.<br />
      <br />
      update notification should be working if you at least run pimpbot 4.2.2 (or some 4.1 version), otherwise get the new version below.<br />

      quite some substantial changes lead to this new major version of pimpbot 4. the updater has a fallback url, .pimp file has been improved (no more accidental inclusion of unrelated files) and some of the advanced features can now be recreated from their .pimp files. also fixed a bug in the new ui and paved the ground for a new .pimp format (implemented but still disabled.)<br />

      a lot of work has been put into 4.4.4, considering it's only a minor update (one might argue this should've been version 4.5!) no previous version of pimpbot has been tested this thoroughly and i came across quite some bugs. the full changelog is really long, but i want to highlight some of the changes since 4.4.3:<br />
      <br />
      -much faster rebuilding of installers and improved first time building<br />
      -compiler no longer requires admin privileges to build installers<br />
      -improved debugging options, added more developer options<br />
      -added more translations<br />
      -pimpbot setup was reduced in filesize<br />
      -many, many bugfixes<br />
      <br />
      i would've loved to offer a unicode version of pimpbot, but at least three of the plugins it's using are only available as ansi version. unicode would've allowed the inclusion of some of the translations i received that i cannot convert to ansi. i was also hoping to fix a bug that was produced by one of the plugins, but i could only reduce its appearance. if pimpbot crashes during compilation, it will work most of the times on a second attempt. this problem appeared since the earliest pimpbot 4 version but it happens so rarely that i haven't noticed it in a long time. it also just happens on windows 7 (and vista i guess).<br />
      <br />
      enough talking. if you're using a recent version of pimpbot 4, you will be reminded to upgrade from within the program. otherwise you can download pimpbot 4.4.4 manually below.<br />

      as of this version, pimpbot is avaiable in two versions: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.4.4.2-ANSI-setup.exe" target="_blank">ansi</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.4.4.2-Unicode-setup.exe" target="_blank">unicode</a>. the later allows the inclusion of a wider range of language, though for now only bulgarian has been added to the unicode build. for now, the ansi build will stay the default version, but on longterm this will be the unicode build.<br />
      <br />
      another change in this version is the replacement of some internal functions, which should lead to greater stability when building, and a new and improved installer. as functionality stays the same, the change of the version number is minor.<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>PimpBot 4.4.4.4</strong><br />
      pimpbot will turn <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showpost.php?p=1020788&amp;postcount=1" target="_blank">9 years</a> old this year, even <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showpost.php?p=2088996&amp;postcount=33" target="_blank">pimpbot 3</a> was first released 6 years ago. there are hardly any more avs releases this day, but still i felt motivated to improve the tool over the years and if it was only for my own needs.<br />
      <br />
      today version 4.4.4.4 is out! i'm sure it won't be the last version, but i don't plan to play around with it for some time and focus on new tasks. i think it's also time to recommend changing to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pimpbot/downloads/detail?name=pimpbot-4.4.4.4-Unicode-setup.exe" target="_blank">unicode</a> built, even if that means slightly bigger installer sizes (36864 bytes for a "standard" installer). the new version brings more languages, upgraded components and some minor bugfixes. there are a few known bugs, but i doubt anyone will ever run into them.<br />
      <br />
      since the introduction of pimpbot 4, there have been some new features that are worthwhile updating your old installers.<br />
      <br />
      -less virus reports, even if these were false positives (this is worth the update alone!)<br />
      -installers only require admin rights when necessary<br />
      -more reliable winamp detection, including alternative plugin folders<br />
      -improved ape handling<br />
      <br />
      if you kept your old pimp files, an update takes two clicks. right-click on the pimpbot file, choose "rebuild installer" (or "edit" to apply changes). if you, like me, have <i>many</i> installers, you can compile one of pimpbot's helpers: the multitool. you will find this in your the "tools" folder of your pimpbot location and you can compile it by right-clicking and choosing "compile nsis script". more conveniently, you can compile it through pimpot's installer or the entry in your context menu. as the name suggests, multitool allows you to load many pimpbot and to recompile them at one click. if you care about your users, you gotta update!<br />
      <br />
      i know there are many people that don't even keep their pimp files. in that case there's another helper: resourcegrab. you compile it as described above and then drop any of your old installers onto it. this will extract the splash screen, (and if you provide ResHacker.exe in the same dir), the icons and checkboxes. this should make it more pleasant to rebuild your old installers and keeping your old graphics.<br />
      <br />
      that's all i can think of right now. thanks to everyone who helped translating pimpbot or who helped finding bugs and improving the software!<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>fun fact</strong><br />
      just came across this on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:<br />
      <br />
      <i>NSIS was created to distribute Winamp. It is based on a previous Nullsoft product, <b>PiMP (plugin Mini Packager)</b>, and is also known as SuperPiMP.</i><br />
      <br />
      i used pimp for my first installer, hence i went for the name "pimpbot", but i dont think i was aware of the meaning of "pimp." :cool:</p>
