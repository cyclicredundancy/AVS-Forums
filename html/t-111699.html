      <p class="post-content">Fuck me? For not responding to his cry-baby attitude that requires everything to be spoonfed in personal, managed portions? Seriously, it might just be me, but when I'm looking for something, I fire up Google, search relevant sites if they provide this feature, just like I would go to the library instead of bugging my professors with annoying questions.<br />
      <br />
      It seems this is a recent phenomenon on the internet. And it's related to the schooling system that is used everywhere in the Western world: people sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher talk about something that doesn't interest him/her. Doing something yourself is discouraged.<br />
      Think about this: a few years ago, before the Internet was popular, when a pupil had to write a report and he/she did research in the library, he/she was commended for his/her interests. Now if the same pupil looks on the Internet for sources, he/she is considered lazy and just a copy-cat.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know about you, but I get tons of mail from people expecting me to give them "lessons in AVS", "a handbook in AVS", "a comprehensive guide in making presets" (these are actual quotes from emails) and so on. Does being knowledgable in something automatically place a large "&lt;subject&gt; tutor, free lessons!" on your head?<br />
      <br />
      Yes, it might sound harsh to someone who doesn't know these forums. But then again, that person doesn't know the many hours I've spent writing up the FAQ, writing up short guides and so on. That goes for everyone here. We've all spent countless hours helping eachother out. And I don't know about you, but I'm not comfortable with the idea that everything I say disappears into a void whenever it goes off the first forum page, requiring it to be repeated every few days.<br />
      <br />
      We now have a fully functional forum search and a FAQ. There are big <font color="red">RED</font> letters telling people to search the forums before posting a new topic. But apparently, this isn't enough for some people. Am I the only one who thinks it's arrogant to browse sites at high-speed, only reading the highlights and then being surprised when people are angry at you for missing obvious information?<br />
      <br />
      Yes, we could just say "Here's the FAQ, here are some guides: *link* *link*". That person would be happy with those links, but the next time he/she has a problem, he'll just do the same: expect us to hand the answer, neatly wrapped up in a clickable link. Instead, give people the key to finding what they need: a FAQ or a forum search. Sure, they might not find everything at first, but it's a good exercise in learning how to research information yourself.<br />
      <br />
      Flame me all a want, but when was the last time you saw a "&lt;username&gt; Post count: 1" that didn't ask a question on the FAQ?<br />
      <br />
      Here, from now on, this short link will always point to the FAQ. That way we don't have to look up the URL ourselves when we want to give it out to someone:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://acko.net/avsfaq.php" target="_blank">http://acko.net/avsfaq.php</a><br />
      <br />
      And here's a message, ready to be copy/pasted into threads (it's in UBB-code):<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://acko.net/avsmsg.php" target="_blank">http://acko.net/avsmsg.php</a><br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, you might be on to something! It seems like a good idea, but if a person specifically looked in the FAQ before even thinking about posting a new thread, and then when they did, the FAQ popped up, it might get a little annoying. Especially if they have one of those really weird questions that seems simple, but it is much more complicated than it would seem at a glance.<br />
      <br />
      But I think the benefit would far outweigh the frustration / inconvenience.<br />
      <br />
      Good idea!</p>

      Today's headline: A 18 year old technical student from belgia, started a shooting in his school in the middle of an computer class. The motive or the reason for this bloodbath is yet unknown but according to eye witnesses the shooter was sitting at his computer desk yelling "Read the fucking FAQ you fucking n00b!" only seconds before he pulled his two 9mm Beretta guns from his pockets and started shooting. Now a interview with his parents....<br />

      <br />
      Soccer mom: "No! *sob* We really don't know. We always thought he was a happy kid. Of course, we didn't really see him all that much and we hardly spoke to eachother these days. I thought we had raised a good kid??? *sob* It's probably because of those stupid video games! And violent movies! How else could our peaceful child's mind have been infected with such violent thoughts? I mean, sure my husband keeps a whole arsenal of world-war two memorabilia around, and he does spend a lot of time at the shooting range, but we were always such a happy family! *flips through a photoalbum to the camera* I mean, just last week I entered his room when I heard some funny noises, a computer game I thought. I didn't want to disturb him, but I was just bringing him his clean laundry, until I saw what was on screen: people getting shot to pieces! I immediately asked what he was doing, and he just said 'Having fun, mom!'. 'Having fun???' How could he think shooting people was fun? If I think about it now, maybe we should've sent him to military school after all, I mean, that's where kids learn discipline instead of having their minds poisoned with the idea that killing people is okay in our society! Thank god we have such a good government, just yesterday on TV, after President Bush had been talking about how our military had again achieved a great victory and destroyed tons of terrorist training camps (c'mon, they were *disguised* as schools!), he spoke about how violent movies and videogames must be stopped! Our youth must learn that violence is not the solution to problems!"</p>
