(We had best start warning teh n00bs!11!!!!1!)<br><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by dirkdeftly</i><br><b>i have two instances of texerII. the first does some changes to gmegabuf onbeat. both should immediately accept these changes, but it seems that one or the other doesn't accept them until one frame aftewards (i *think* it's the first one, but i'm not sure)</b></blockquote>From my recent work with apes I can tell you that Texer II probably executes init, frame, beat and point in a fixed order every frame. If it was executing init-&gt;frame-&gt;beat-&gt;point then changes on beat would only affect the second texer's frame code<br><br>The reason for using this order is that you want on beat code to always take priority over on frame. This is because setting variables on beat should always overwrite what they were set to per frame so that right values are there for the per point code. In addition, it means that you can respond to a beat on the frame that the beat happens on, and not have to wait for the next one.<br><br>I haven't tested this theory out... but I'd guess that superscope, dm etc do the same and that this is why they provide the 'b' variable.<br><br>If I was making Texer II this is certainly how I would implement it, and this would cause a problem like what you describe where the first texer executes the code on beat and the second one executes its frame code with these new values, but the first does not.<br><br>EDIT: just looking at your test preset... i don't get any bug... what is odd though is that if i insert effect lists to destroy fps then sometimes 4 blobs are rendered per frame instead of 2... I thought maybe I was going nuts so I slowed it right down to 10fps and screenshotted it a few times. All sensibly coded so as to avoid the problem I mentioned above too... setting the el to 1 frame has no effect here<br><br>EDIT2: the above is actually just an artifact of the preset construction (els). If two consecutive frames are beat frames then the framebuffer isn't cleared so 4 dots are drawn instead of 2. could this be causing your problem also?(although i cant see it?).. i doubt it as this effect list job looks like it was made to expose the problem. btw... the tiling pattern is nice... looks correct in all res I tried it on.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th February 2005 13:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Re: Re: Truchet lines</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by jheriko</i><br><b>init, frame, beat and point in a fixed order every frame.
