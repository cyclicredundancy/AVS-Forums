      The Earth! :D I've been working on this one slowly for a couple of months now and as a learned more things about how AVS worked, I incorperatied them into this preset. It runs a little slowly unless you have a monster system, so set the resolution a slight bit lower than usual if you want good results. If anyone out there can help me combine the two movement effects that control the sphere shape and still get the exact same results, I'd really appreciate it. I've been having trouble doing it myself. That would really fine tune my visualization. Anyway, tell me what you think guys. Thanks. :)<br />

      On a side note, my new pack "Closer to Demiurgy" is almost out. It should be done within a week now so as soon as I ship it off to WinAmp, I'll post it up here for everyone to see. I want to do one or two more original visualizations and then a couple more remixes and that will be it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Solamon, that AVS is tricky.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to make a VERY VERY minor change, (you know what I mean when I say very, LOL).....<br />
      <br />
      I only added one thing, so I don't know if it helps.<br />
      <br />
      It adds a "cloud" look to the globe.<br />
      <br />
      Not much of a difference, though, little if any.<br />
      <br />
      Tell me what ya think.</p>

      <p class="post-content">first off let me say once again great work....second i remixed it because you said something like you wanted the 2 main movements to be combined into one movement right? well i did that and its not exactly right but its pretty close i think.....well here it is tell me if that was it or not.....anyway great job</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the help guys, but thats not quite what I'm looking for.<br />
      <br />
      Jake:<br />
      I can get the continents pulling towards the center by just deleting the first movement. I'm trying to keep the integrity of the sphere in tact. Which as you see, is a real pain in the @$$. I appreciate your input though. :)<br />
      <br />
      Aaron:<br />
      I know what you mean by tricky, man. Just one slight change and everything falls apart.<br />
      <br />
      I'm very glad that you guys liked it though. I consider this preset and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=72318" target="_blank">magic carpet</a> among the best presets I have every made. Anymore feedback guys? I'm really interested in what everyone thinks of these two. :) Thanks.</p>

      Wew, cool preset! But there's only little thing: The Preset is a bit dark...i tried to set a brightness filter somewhere, but this preset is too complicated for me. :(</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the compliments guys! :D I hear ya about the darkness though. I was thinking about adding a brightness filter but was worried about it running too slow. Here is a version with a slight brightness applied. It looks real good but it takes about at 5%-10% fps dive. I might make this the offical final version. What does everyone think? Is the brightness worth the tradeoff of system resourses? :)</p>

      <br />
