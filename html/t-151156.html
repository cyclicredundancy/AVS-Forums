After reading a couple of threads about AVS problems, i decided to start this thread, expecting to list here what should be improved for the next AVS studio. Please note that i won't do any developping (i could but it would be really bad), i'm just starting the topic.. Also post what version of Winamp and what version of AVS studio you have.<br><br>Ok, so far here are my thoughts :<br>:winamp: <b>Winamp3</b><br>:winamp:<i>AVS studio v2.5.1</i><br>- Fix those crash bugs. What's weird is that sometimes, Windows pop a critical alert, forcing you to close winamp, also it is still running fine in the BG. Maybe it could be possible to prevent Windows for doing that (a non-working preset makes winamp exit anyway).<br>- Log file : before a random avs starts to load, its name is written to a log file. That's easier to fix a pb if a preset makes winamp crash.<br>- Major improvement in multi-monitoring. That's to say :<br>- Full screen on a selected monitor only, the list is still available on the other one.<br>- Screensaver gestion : disable screensaver on the screen running AVSes but still allow it on the one with the list.<br>- Auto TV select Mode : most PCs/Laptops have a tv-out jack. If the option to do so is selected, turn AVS fullscreen @640*480*32 (or according to the TV standard). Maybe had native support for NTSC/PAL, and improve the display code according to the settings.<br><br>Hmm, i had other ideas but that's all i can remember so far.<br>Had your list here ! :up:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Miles Prower</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st October 2003 20:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Oh, i forgot :rolleyes:<br>- Support for remote control.

What about pixel doubling ?<br>I though of making an easy access to this kind of mode. I don't have any trouble doing this (but i don't use overlay, the video-out blocks everything that is overlay to prevent DVD copying) but i'm sick of changing all the parameters each time i want to do that. A one press button (think "Fullscreen") would make things easier.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by Miles Prower : Full screen on a selected monitor only, the list is still available on the other one.[/B]<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The fact is that without overlay, you only have one choice if you want a separate screens gestion : the main monitor (i use a laptop so that's the lcd screen) is used to display the list and the second one (a PAL tv in my case) displays the visualisations. To make it work, you have to use a "trick" : the second monitor isn't fullscreen, but a windowed AVS of a resolution bigger than the TV's so you don't see the edges of the AVS window. This "improper" fullscreen mode makes the pc runs slowly (i have just no problem running most presets @ 400*300*32bits, without pixel-doubling, in real full screen mode). I'd rather have a real fullscreen option for the second monitor (the tv) only and the list still accessible. Moreover, this saves some hassle.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2003 00:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">We have a forum for this you know...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">S-uper_T-oast</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2003 03:16 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't really see a point to most of your suggestions, but I would like it if AVS would keep my screensaver from coming up... don't know if that was fixed by the new version or any time...<br>btw-nice avatar UnConeD, that done in avs?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2003 04:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">and 640x480 is 640x480. pixel doubling makes it 320x240.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2003 09:21 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">heh.. groovy new avatar ucd<br>:\</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd October 2003 09:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I liked the old one.

I'm not that good in math.<br>I only use 640*480 for i connect it to a tv screen.<br>nd if you don't get the point of multi-monitoring with a TV set, think that a good quality TV is still way less expensive than a projector or something. I 'd just like to have such a feature anyway.
