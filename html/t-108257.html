Try and make it do something specific, thats more challenging, rather than using the in built examples try and build something from scratch. The preset is quite nice to look at. I'd recommend you try and make a roto blitter style effect using the Dynamic Movement, then you can customise it more. :)<br><br>Before you start thinking that coding isn't too powerful I've attached an example of the superscope's power unleashed so that you can know what it can do. Yes it is solid 3d geometry (which is what I do). With some practice you will be able to do similar things. (Feel free to rip the code apart)<br><br>If you want to start creating complex geometry for superscopes then start with the basics, try making circles and lines that do different things, then you can put them together into more complex objects or start defining new shapes. Try and figure out things like how to draw a line from one point to another and how to draw a circle arc from one point to another, then move onto things like making a filled square or making a line that spins and moves in 3d... keep trying to make specific things as well as messing about with existing code, that way you will be able to make a preset that you want to make as well as being able to stumble upon something nice or clever looking.<br><br>Don't forget how all of the variables work either or how the co-ordinate system works, those things are important to understand other wise you will leave redundant calculations in code without realising it sometimes.<br><br>There is an AVS troubleshooting forum and an AVS presets forum but I don't think that anyone cares too much about where everything is, if they do then it will be moved for you.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2002 02:33 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The question is, if you pour something into the Klein bottle, does it stay in? :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2002 02:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">The answer to your question is that there is no way to pour something into it. :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zevensoft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2002 06:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">[Post Deleted]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th October 2002 15:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yup.

It just happens that it is also the projection of the 4d Klein bottle which is the smae shape except that it doesn't self-intersect. So 4-D twisted donut is pretty much correct.

You can not construct a moebius stip in 2d, it is a rectangle twisted and connected end to end in 3d, but you can connect a rectangle end to end by bending it to create a ring like you can bend a cylinder to make a torus. The klein bottle is the same thing except we have a cylinder instead of a rectangle, the only way to make this shape is to construct it in 4-space. It is basically a torus which has been twisted into 4-space like the moebius strip is a ring twisted into 3 space.<br><br><br>As for the bouncing spring, thats some good(ish) superscope-ing but the preset is ruined by the Fyrewurx, the jumpy movement and roto blitter.<br><br>Fyrewurx are nasty.</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
