OK effect.<br>Ultimate Trap V - SSC and stars kinda blend together, but its OK.<br>Vertigo I - Don't like the lines or moving particles.<br>Vertigo II.2 - Don't like the lines. Isn't very reactive - very constant.<br>Vertigo III.2 - Still don't like the lines. OK morphing look to it with the background.<br>Gaussian I - Very very repetitive. Use DM's and nonrepetitive scopes.<br>Gaussian II - Better, but swirl should be a DM instead of a movement so rotation speed/direction changes.<br>Gaussian III - Very repetitive again. Don't like circles in background.<br>Diego I.2 - Noobish look. DDM looks like default(I'm not sure if it is or not, because I don't feel like checking).<br>Diego II.2 - Turns white fairly often. DDM is too static.<br>Diego III - Turns white also. Also has some flashing in it.<br>Deviant's Revenge - Simple line SSC preset. Try adding something else or making SSC more complicated.<br>Deviant's Revenge(Nic01 remix) - Don't like it's looks. Too static, the blobs should morph.<br>Arcane - Ugly edge effects for left and right(not too noticible). turns too bright too often. Don't really like the mosaic.<br><br>You should number your presets so they stay in order. I would also take out some of the remixes. Seeing the same basic preset 5 times isn't that great.
