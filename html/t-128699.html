To make it zoom in and out you could add a variable(lets call it dz) to your superscopes. Now because this variable has to be in synch with all the scopes your best bet will be to use getosc()(Atero will tell you not to use straight up getosc(), but I don't think it makes a big difference). Here's an example:<br>BEAT: ddz=getosc(.2,.2,0); (find a new value for z)<br>FRAME: dz=.9*dz+.1*ddz; (slowly "morph" dz into ddz)<br>PIXEL:iz=if(above(z3,0.1),1/(z3+dz),0); (just change this line. this is what causes the zooming)<br>Mainly, just try to understand it on your own.<br><b>Hyperbole</b> - Take out the r = r*r/log(r); movement and make it something else. That isn't a very aesthetic movement.<br><b>Retro</b> - Not too great looking or complex, but I do like that you used SSC's, which are much more customizable than Render/Simple's. Colors and shapes don't mix well and the movement isn't anything spectacular<br><b>Star</b> - Not bad, but gets kinda boring. Try replacing the Roto Blitter with a nice direction changing morphing/sliding DM.<br><b>Oni</b> - Don't really like the sharp lines and it could use something more than solid areas(like a nice texture or background), but it is unique. Oh, and don't use the tentacles ape like that. Use a nice SSC or such.<br><b>ITV</b> - Nothing spectacular. You showcased that movement already in Hyperbole. Use something else here.<br><b>Colorbound</b> - n00bish movement. Come up with something a little more unique.<br><b>Coil</b> - Nothing spectacular. Just a lot of SSC's with a water and blur thrown on top.<br><b>Planescaping mk iii</b> - Don't like the movement. You've used this SSC before.<br><b>Seperation anxiety version 2</b> - It's nice, but try to make your own SSC for it.<br><b>Omnivision</b> - Seen similar before. Not terrible, but not terribly exciting either.<br><b>Ant Metropolis</b> - Kinda chaotic, and I'm tired of the bump/mosaic presets, but it's alright.<br><b>Strobe</b> - Would be good if it didn't hurt my eyes.:p Decent strobe effect, but I've seen better.<br><font color="red">Overall: 2.8</font>. Not bad, but work on your technical stuff and aesthetics. These are definitely good for a first pack, but aren't top notch. Do some remixes and new presets and post them.

      those two posts were to alert whoever had not posted their presets after advertising them that they weren't there. People will only go back to their thread if there are replies. Any replies.<br>
      <br>
      A few pointless posts i admit, some of them are slightly funny though (well they seemed to be when i typed them... never mind) but we're talking about something completely different here. I sometimes don't make a valued contribution. You on the other hand continually ressurect threads. I was simply pointing out that you shouldn't of done unless you had something important to add (which you obviously didn't) because it's irritating and pointless. You didn't have to bring up irrelevant information to try and put me down when all i'm doing is trying to stop dead threads being ressurected.</p>
