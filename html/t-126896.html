      <p class="post-content">ok first off, these have been done waaaaaaay too many times, they're basically the newpicks with a little added on the end. Try and come up with some original ideas and themes. These arent bad presets but theres too many of them around.<br />
      <br />
      If you really want to keep them then make the scopes move around more freely, add z movement and move them around more, make them change shape and when theres all three of the same scope in 3 different presets, make it one preset with all 3 scopes instead. make them less random v type movements on the lines as well and try and make some DM's. These are all also too grainy, work on making them smoother and less very fast random and jerky movements.<br />
      <br />
      These are good noob presets keep it up these are just some tips for improvement, i wouldnt advise releasing these but work on them to gain some more knowledge of avs then develop some original ideas and then release. ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm sorry in advance if this review is too harsh, but these presets are really bothering me. Don't take anything to harshly. Just try to use this as constructive criticism.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Swirly Thing</b> - Definitely seen this one before. Except the others don't have the weird looking edges at the end of the SSC. Use some slow morphing with the rotation and add another dimension to it(I'm not meaning make it 3-D, but do something that will make it stand out in a good way).<br />
      <b>3D-Coil</b> - Wow, this is very repetitive. If you want to do something that has been done before you have to do it differently with something extra that will make it even better than theirs. This is very very simple.<br />
      <b>3D-Fairly Simple</b> - Speaking of simple, this is just as repetitive and even simpler. The SSC's look bad and do not have any dynamics whatsoever. You even used the color cycler. The point of AVS is to make something that reacts to the music. This doesn't.<br />
      <b>3D-Stars and Spirals</b> - Very similar comments to the previous two, but this one has the added eyesore of a very grainly, multi-colored starfield. Work on being able to have this stuff change with the music.<br />
      <b>Color Energy</b> - Yay. Another epilepsy preset. I should make a compilation pack with these things. It is apparent that you don't know much about how AVS works after looking at this. You used a DM that was completely static. Use a movement instead. Plus the flashing is really bothering me. At least it hid those moving particles.<br />
      <b>Blurry Spinning Music Thing</b> - Very repetitive. My comments stay the same for this as for the previous ones.<br />
      <br />
      <font color="red">Overall:1.5</font>. Work on your dynamics and you could make some decent presets, but these are all merely visuals. I could be watching them without music and get the same effect as with music.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually the DM in color energy was a bit of an accident. What would be a good way to make the presets more music responsive.<br />
      And are there ways of making 3d DM's without raytracing.</p>

      <p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd March 2003 02:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p>

      <p class="post-content">Raytracing is extremely complex. DM's aren't necessarily. Just use the math that you've learned in school and try to learn more online or in books, etc.<br />
      <br />
      To make AVS music-responsive there are several things you can do. One is to use getosc/getspec to make the SSC or DM react to different parts of the sound spectrum. This is difficult. The easy way is to make it beat responsive. The easiest way to do this is to use the SSC and DM on beat editboxes. Here, you can change the speed, position, time, whatever so that on beat there will be a change. Here's an example<br />
      <br />
      INIT : n=2; x1=0;y1=0;x2=.5;y2=.5;q=0;<br />
      BEAT : nx1=rand(200)/100-1;ny1=rand(200)/100-1;nx2=rand(200)/100-1;ny2=rand(200)/100-1;<br />
      FRAME : x1=.9*x1+.1*nx1;y2=.9*y2+.1*ny2;x2=.9*x2+.1*nx2;y2=.9*y2+.1*nx2;<br />
      PIXEL : q=bnot(q);x=x1*q+x2*bnot(q);y=y1*q+y2*bnot(q);<br />
      <br />
      Here's a quick breakdown: The beat code makes two random points at (nx1,ny1) and (nx2,ny2). The frame code then slowly morphs the old points, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), to the new points. The pixel code then plots the two points.<br />
      <br />
      If you have any further questions search the forums, check out Atero's primer, and then you can Private Message me if you still have questions.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well, it LOOKS like you know what you're doing, you're just not doing it very well. it is, despite popular belief, a good start. i'd rather n00bs started off fiddling with SSCs and DMs rather than a) using moving particles and standard movements and so forth or b) whining to the forums that the "math involved" with SSCs and DMs is too hard :)<br />
      however, as everyone said...these really are simple. check out my avs primer :down: which WILL...<b>WILL</b> be updated soon. I've stalled out on it because of school etc. unfortunately, however I'm trying to get working on it again...it will be much more accurate and complete than the first.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Much better job. Don't use straight up getspec's though. Makes it a bit too chaotic. To make a cube you just use x1,y1,z1 and create a counter variable in per point and set each point to plus or minus 1 depending on the counter variable. Then you have to use the rotation equations,etc. You can find these in Atero's primer(better description pending) or by searching the forums.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Could I use the variable i as the per point counter for a cube and should it alternate between -1 and 1 depending on if the number is even or odd. By the way<br />
      ;-c ,rattaplan I think y1,y2 &amp; x1,x2 are simply custom variables used to take the place of x and y,because if you used the real x and y 3D-2D translation wouldn't work. Just treat x1,y1 as if they were x and y.</p>

      Use fr or something as a counter.<br />

      <p class="post-content">x1,y1, and z1 are conventionally used as your 3D coordinates. x2,y2,z2,x3,y3,and z3 are used in the process of rotating those coordinates around the central axis and the values in them shouldn't be messed with unless you really know what you are doing. After rotation, the 3D-2D projection gives you the final x and y values.</p>

      <p class="post-content">You need to know some math, but not much for simple SSC's. Yeah, unless you really like to know what's going on, or you are trying to know how to do more complicated things, you don't need to know x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x, or y. You do need to know x1, y1, and z1, because they are the actual variables that use the 3D equations. You may have to modify the camera distance as well. This will normally be at the end where it says something like z3=1/(z3+c), where c is the camera distance(something like 3 or so).</p>

      <p class="post-content">i dont use x2,3 etc etc i just condense it all into the x1, y1, z1, x and y in my scopes with 3d rotation. eg for a sphere scope in the "per point" section:<br />
      <br />
      rtx=i*tpi*20;<br />
      dtx=cos(i*pi+pi/2);<br />
      x1=sin(rtx)*(dtx));<br />
      y1=cos(rtx)*(dtx));<br />
      z1=cos(i*pi)+(sin(zzz));<br />
      x=(x1*zzz+y1*zaz)*yyy+z1*yay;<br />
      y=(x1*zaz-y1*zzz)*xax+((x1*zzz+y1*zaz)*yay-z1*yyy)*xxx;<br />
      <br />
      with all the rotation getoscs or getspecs whatever i feel like using i find that the easiest way to read it and modify it. That shifts it around quite nicely i think. I just dont like setting variables for things that are only used once, i dont see the point. The x1, y1 and z1 sets the actual shape of the object, in this case a sphere, obviously pi and tpi are pi and pi*2. then inside the brackets in x and y are the conventional x2's, etc etc. A lot of them are not necessary for decent rotation, only a few are needed and it rotates around nicely IMO. ive probably got some fatal error but meh, works for me.</p>
