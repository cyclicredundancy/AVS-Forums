It messes up if I try. Fix that bug.<br><br>1 - Don't like the visible screen edges with the rotating movement. The two lines(crossing in the middle) should move around.<br>2 - Don't like the black part in the middle. The background is also slightly repetitive in it's movement.<br>3 - The static movement isn't that great. Try a DM. Also has some graininess.<br>4 - Not a big fan of bump or the 5-pointed distro. The sides look out of place.<br>5 - Movement is a bit chaotic. Try slowing it down if possible.<br>6 - Don't like the water effect in this preset. Use a nice DM instead.<br>7 - Somewhat boring. A little spicing up could make this preset nice.<br>8 - Edges distort with the movement. The lines shouldn't jump immediately from one point to another - have them move there.<br>9 - Noobish. Use a SSC instead of the osc. star. And use DM's for effects like this.<br>10 - Looks more like an intro. Background should apply to the bottom half of the screen(have it move up and down). Letters should move a bit more too.<br>11 - Try remixing this one after you learn 3-D SSC's. The ships aren't that great. Also using a 3-D camera could help too.<br>12 - Don't like the moving particles or bump. Screen is too white.<br>13 - Alpha Blending Needed!!! Simple 3-D movement, but could use the alpha blending fog, definitely.<br>14 - Nicest preset in the pack, IMHO. Make the camera move some.<br>15 - Looks a lot like the sunburster preset that comes with winamp.<br>16 - Mirror ruins it. Don't like this kind of preset, but many people end up making at least one(myself included).<br>17 - Movement is static. Use something that changes. Please excuse me while I have a bout of epilepsy.<br>Overall - 2.5. Still has noobish presets. Learn more advanced AVS techniques before pack 3.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th February 2003 07:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ok you know im gonna post a big reply so here goes ;) right first off that has got to be the <b>SHITTIEST</b> installer i have ever seen, aghhh it took me about 10 minutes just to find where the hell itd put the presets, sort that out :mad:<br><br>Secondly, dont schedule your avs creating, you'll end up rushing and shoving in a load of crappy noob presets just to fill it up :rolleyes: let your creativity take its own course :)<br><br>Now the presets, Once i managed to get them to the avs folder they werent in order :mad: too much fucking about just switching from preset to preset, you have to find which one your looking for, irritating, sort it. Ok presets:<br><br><b>OTE =1 intro</b> - first off, i <b>hate</b> the colours in this, ugh they're horrible. Its not a bad preset, i dont like the way the circles go over the text, the actual text is good though, both the texts should go at the same speed though and those green lines should move around like anubis said. <font color="red">3.4/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =2 blockbuster</b> - augh, jeesys, i really dont like this. The black bit irritates the hell out of me and the background is noobish and the colour is awful, if youve yet to release take this out please, i dont know what to do with that <font color="red">2.0/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =3 alien flower</b> - better, i like the colours and the whole swirly thing. The swirling isnt very original though, its been done too many times and looks a little like the newpicks, still a tad noobish but better, i would make it rotate and change the scope to make it 3d, also make the swirling change directions and position onbeat more. <font color="red">3.3/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =4 damaged warp core</b> - meh, it dosent look too bad with the colours and the bump but its boring and your making use of a bug in the DM. MAke the DM more dynamic and make it less "fuzzy", not bad but still looks a bit noobish though <font color="red">2.9/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =5 simulated happines</b> - better again, Ive done something with a similar DM but i did another DM and made it a two plane thingy... your DM is waay too fast, mine was like it and im contemplating scrapping it because its either too fast or takes too long to start up, good work but the colours are noobish and darkened still, i would work on the background thing and turn it into some sort of eye type thing ;) <font color="red">3.5/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =6 real happiness</b> - another slightly noobish preset with the water and mirror, it shows you are progressing though and using scopes instead of built-in renderings, i still dont like that light blue and green but they look smoother now, i like the way it looks when it gets going but it still looks a bit on the noobish side <font color="red">3.4/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =7 shiny paradise</b> - this is definately one of the better ones but ive seen a similar effect done before, good work though, youve used that "pipe type line thing" effect too much in the pack though, change it to a different one in some presets, the smoke effect looks nice though, the background and the smoke should change more onbeat though, its a bit boring. <font color="red">3.9/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =8 under the skin</b> - another of the better ones, the edges are dodgy when it rotates though, fix that. Also make the speed and the direction of the rotation change onbeat more, and it looks a little chaotic and the movements very unsmooth when it just nudges slightly, fix that. The pinks just.... pink though, i wouldnt have pink but its your preset. [colout=red]3.3/5.0[/colour]<br><b>OTE =9 speedy octopus</b> - oh god no, please no. The colours are pretty good but otherwise, no no NO. its an oscilloscope star that zooms left at a constant speed, PLEASE do something better than that, youve proved you can do better than that :p sorry im just dissapointed. <font color="red">2.0/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =10 hardcore phaze</b> - this is the best preset in the pack probably, thanks for the credit, looks nice and i like the way youve modified the background around, looks good, this is an all round good preset, i even like the colours in this one :p ;) i wouldve used this as the intro though and had the pack name moving about, ahh well. <font color="red">4.2/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =11 klingon ambush</b> - nice idea, i like the target thing, the way it goes out with the purpley thingys looks good. Its a little hard to see the ships, id make better scopes for the ships and add a little more rotation and zooming but otherwise, good. <font color="red">3.4/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =12 cheeky kalleidoscope</b> looks pretty good, i wouldnt have the bump moving around though, center it with this "x=0.5;y=0.5", that'l leave it centered. The colours are a little too bright but otherwise, good preset. <font color="red">3.5/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =13 another-disco-mix</b> - Nice DM but it still looks bad, it still needs alpha blendinga dn the simples look very bad, the DM is excellent though, nice work there, i would advise putting one of your lesser presets as the background for this, would look much better. <font color="red">3.8/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =14 barbeque</b> now this looks sweet. very nice with the colours and the movement there, the movement could be a little more dynamic and move around more, id have more happening but this looks great. Youve made me hungry now :) <font color="red">3.8/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =15 spank</b> - "nice" name there :p this has been done too many times too, it should zoom in and out and there should be more colours, i dont like the way the blue goes to light blue then to white, it looks awful and noobish, sort that out. Looks good when the colour subsides though but needs a lot more work. <font color="red">3.0/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =16 grandma</b> - mmm, not seen too many like this, it looks pretty good, there should be more happening and some blending and better colours. It looks pretty good and the curves look good but it still needs work. <font color="red">3.4/5.0</font><br><b>OTE =17 the fingerprint of rage</b> - a little similar to grandma i think, it looks ok but the flashing annoys the hell out of me and hurts my eyes, fix that, also it looks too bright again. Too much bright colour next to white, not bad i suppose but its very repetitive and irritating. <font color="red">2.9/5.0</font><br><br>Overall i would give it a <font color="red">3.3/5.0</font>, there are some nice things in there but they need work and you NEED some better colour schemes. Nice ideas though, keep avsing and keep learning and keep coding and... and...<br><br>im going to go... holy shit ive been here typing for 45 minutes, jeeesys, im late for school :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Phaze1987</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th February 2003 09:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for your comments guys ! :) The installer worked fine on my machine...Oh and 1pack/month i think i can handle, 3-4 hours i have after school before "killing" my keyboard IRCing (that sounds like a sentence from Yoda lol ).Anyway im still working and,i think i said it,i didnt put everything i knew in the pack.I still have math to learn so i dont think i`ll use too complex SSCs or DMs but i`ll do my best.Now for the 3d DM in the pack...Not mine !
