It will take a while to look at, but will have more input, hopefully giving you a few points on what to do next :)<br><br>Here we go :)<br><br>Bass---------Interesting combination of monochromatic colors. I like the movement, I think it could be a bit slower, but overall it is a decent preset. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Blood Storm--Yet another interesting preset, although I don't like the name. Something like Lava Storm or Airborne Lava sounds nicer. Nice graphical effects. Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Bubbling DM--Hmm....all of these presets are interesting so far! I like the swirl effect! Now if you can make more color combinations!<br>I give this one a 3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Burnout-------Normally lines like that would get in the way, but it fits in well with this preset. The water bump also adds a nice motion effect. Maybe a bit more colorfade? Just a suggestion.<br>Overall another nice preset. Score---- 3 3/4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Chasing the Dragon----Almost looks like a big junky galaxy with multi colored stars. I like it, though! Good preset. I give it 3 3/4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Disco Ball-----This one certainly lives up to its name. Since that is true, I give it a 4 1/2 Stars out of 5 Stars....oh, by the way, try mixing in the mosaic effect on that one. It creates a great disco ball effect.<br><br>Frozen Screen----Hmm...interesting name. Almost looks like some sort of cosmic explosion fading to white. Not a bad preset, but it can be worked with a bit more. 3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Heaven 2------I don't like the color scheme used here. They just don't go well together in my opinion. The effects are simple, and nice, but the colors drag down the overall rating. Score----3 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Heaven-------Looks like big neon fuzzballs! LOL...This scheme is much better than the second one. Better score too. Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Incobus 2----Nyeh, I'm not all that impressed with it. Its too "rough around the edges" for me. Score----2 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Incobus------Better than the second one. More effects and the colors go better together. I like it. 3 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Leak-------What about calling it Wet Paint? LOL...Everything is going so fast that it looks like someone is sloshing big buckets of paint on a white wall. Good colors and effects. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Left Behind----Awesome! Spectacular shapes and graphical effects make this one of the best in the pack so far. Nice work. Score----4 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Lost in Space---What about getting rid of that periodic stop in beat? I think it would look better as just a continual flow. Very simple preset. Score----3 1/4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>My 3D------Quite simple, good effects, looks like an infinite loop of rings connected. Simple, nice, cute. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Poisonous Flower----Yes, a nice preset. What this preset lacks, though, is a release of a color from the flowers' center, as if it is emitting a poisonous substance. Maybe purple or red? Make something spew from the middle to make this preset the best it can be. Score---- 4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Power Ball-----Not really a "ball". Not bad effects, though. Simple and nice preset. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Roller-------Interesting. Looks like dim neon floating around. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Rubber---How about Big Soap Bubble? LOL. That's what it looks like, because it is casting a reflection of its atmosphere onto the screen.<br>Nice preset. Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Star of Destruction-----Good one, good one. It really IS a star, too! LOL.....Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Trust Me------Nice, although I'd much rather have a different name for it, like Spearmint Kaleidoscope or somethin'. Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Turn Me On 2---Interesting combination of colors and movement effects. Score-----3 3/4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Turn Me On-----Better shapes, but speed is too fast. Slow it down, and it has a better chance of really "turning me on". Score---3 3/4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Unmasked-------Great preset. Nice blocky partial out use. Score----4 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Vision------Interesting, but the presets are starting to get repetitive. Something more interesting perhaps? Score---3 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Waves------Nice preset. I would like it to be a bit lighter in the background. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Weird Objects-----And that they are. Weird preset. Score----3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>What a Mess-------Despite the name, it is not a mess of a preset. Beautiful color choice. Score----4 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Xploding Sun------Good choice for a name. I like the preset too. Score---- 4 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br>Zeus----Too similar to many other presets you have in this pack. It's okay, but not as creative as some. Score----3 Stars of 5 Stars<br><br><br>Overall, this pack gets a score of 4 of 5 Stars, or 80 % . It's hard to get 5/5. LOL.<br><br>Creativity Score nets a 3 1/2 Stars of 5 Stars...there were many presets that looked too similar to others in the pack.<br><br>Name choice score----Some of the names weren't what I would call "fitting", but names arent the most important part of the pack. Score----4 Stars of 5 Stars.<br><br>Good job with this pack!

This is the AVS Discussion board and I think we can all act a little bit more civilized. Right now we are all kind of acting like gripping old ladies. The subject isn't even remotely similar to AVS anymore, it's just a bunch of bitching back and forth. I will agree, it does seem as if montana is always trying to stir up some trouble. Either he's downrating someone, acting like he the word on AVS, or using that stupid ghetto slang (Which is something else seeing that he's from sweden. Is there even black people in sweden or just imported gangster rap?) and typing poorly. The only way to handle the actions of such people is to just ignore them. Pretend as if they don't exist. One of two things will happen. Either they will leave, or they will straighten up (which would be much more preferable, Montana, because nobody really wants you to leave). That is what I propose we do to handle the situation. <font color="crimson">If Montana acts out of hand, we should all just ignore him.</font> This is a message board, it is very easy just to skip over his posts or add him the ignore list. <font color="darkblue">If Montana wants to act like an adult, we should all make it known that he is still very welcome here.</font><br><br>I want to repeat: Montana, don't take any of this personal. You are very welcome here, but your actions need to reflect more maturity. You accuse Aaron of sticking his head up peoples butt, but you do the same thing ALL THE TIME. Please, just try to act more adult. Thats all I have to say on this subject. Now lets get back to talking about visualizations gentlemen.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">aaron595</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2002 20:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Solamon?<br><br>"gripping" old ladies?
