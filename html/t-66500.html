      I'll paste my review here:<br />
      <br />
      "At first I thought this preset pack was neat... until I recognized one of my own unique superscopes in there (the weed-leaf from Whacko AVS II). I also recognized some El-Vis and whyEye.org in there. I don't know about the other things, but my code was used without permission or credit. Glancing at the code, it seems this person knows little about AVS: useless effectlists, exact ripping of movements showing no understanding, ultra-slow bloated presets and over-usage of basic effects. I'd like to have this pack removed."<br />
      <br />
      This pack doesn't deserves 4.5 stars.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>I agree completely!</strong><br />
      I'm a newbie in the forum (even though I've been working with winamp for 2 years)-but my pet pieve is people who want to feel smart, so they copy off the work of someone (who probably spent quite a while getting as good as they are). I won't try to act like an expert because I'm *not.* Everybody has to start somewhere, so it's better to honestly learn things yourself and make things on your own at your own current knowledge. People can make some fairly decent AVS files without a bunch of superscopes &amp; dynamic movements. The only people who copy off of other people are those who are very insecure about their *own* abilities. I think nobody should publish something they can't explain how it works. It's better for these copycats to ask the experts (such as yourself) - who had to work hard to get as smart as they are now- rather than copy off of them. I'm still learning myself, but copycats have bugged me in other areas of my life also.</p>

      </blockquote>It totally depends, that's all I can say. However...<br />
      <br />
      If you read my post carefully you'll see &lt;i&gt;"I don't know about the other things, but my code was used without permission or credit."&lt;/i&gt;. That's according to my policy, which you can read in the comment that I include in every preset and pack I publish. I don't know what the other author's policies are, but I'm sure they don't appreciate copying without credit either.<br />
      <br />
      The line between using something as a starter and copying something is *very* thin, which is why I provide a disclaimer with my presets. To sum it up: to use something made by me (or part of it) you must first contact me and get permission. I will almost never deny a request, but I like to know who uses what.<br />
      <br />
      If you use someone else's work, just give credit where credit is due.<br />
      <br />
      The pack in question doesn't mention anyone else anywhere. The author says:

      <blockquote>
        I made these presets with sofisticated effects, blends, movements and lights.
      </blockquote>which suggests he made them 100% by himself.

      <br />
      [edit: The only preset that it was borrowed for, Induced Nova, has a comment giving credit. I rewrote much of the expression anyway and you can't tell where it came from.]</p>
