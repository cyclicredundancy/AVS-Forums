      I haven't seen it recently but you did a lot of trivial question answering, usually followed by making a fuss when you got a response you didn't like. You also failed to take valid criticism about your presets once or twice.</p>

      </blockquote>Maybe this is what <b>you</b> think, but, IMO, this is no way to judge people. Everybody has different perspectives, and ways to look at art. Mabey, somebody likes AVS presets that analize the music, and don't have that much effects, so this is the art that they create. But, for instance, if you didn't like these presets and thought they were boring, you can't hate/dislike this person for liking different things.

      <p class="post-content">thanks Wildjack,Nic,Jheriko,Nudge.<br />
      anyway the point of this thread was about the challenge thread in the avs forum i started almost a year ago when i was slightly a jerk in saying i was the best noob.<br />
      i know now i'm not the best but i do know i'm a pretty good one, only because of one reason. i went the wrong path and learned the right way.<br />
      <br />
      take chances but make good choices.<br />
      thats my way of living.<br />
      anyway i'm going to be offline on avs for sometime *working on Visualnoob site for a bit* err ahem anyway i guess it wouldn't heart to know what i should add or change to the site. any ideas?</p>

      very funny.<br />
      i'll admit i learn slow but there are advantages to learning something slowly.<br />
      it gives you more time to work with it.<br />
      you know jheriko your one to talk.<br />
      as i remember your first pack was was better then mine but it too was noobish and so on in your later packs you got better and better. make a comparison on Nanakiwurkz V1 to V4 and you will see my point. i experiment before i work with anything. i learn from trial and error.<br />
      sorry if i overreacted a bit. :p to be honest i have archive of failed experiments in avs.<br />
      *maybe i should make a nanakiwurkz rejects pack before i release Visualnoobs V1*

      <br />
      Besides, no matter how black the pot is... that doesn't make the kettle any less black.<br />
      <br />
      Yes, my first pack was a pile of wank, and the one after it.. and the one after that. All of my packs are pretty crappy in fact, except 9. Pack 9 is the first one of my packs I am really happy with.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>see</strong><br />
      Now you know how i feel jheriko when you say i suck when you agree that your packs except for J9 are bunk.<br />
      to be honest Jheriko i think your packs are nice for one reason.<br />
      work.<br />
      hard earned and worked on beautiful pieces of work.<br />
      your packs are a inspiring thing in my work. mind you i don't steal from your packs but i do try to emulate them to some succesful degree.<br />
      <br />
      so you can be offended by me comparing you with me. but to be honest you used to be just like me. you may not know it but i've been in these forums when you were first starting avs. back then i had no idea what avs was untill a year ago.<br />
      so call me a loser or a Lam0r or whatever you want but never call me lazy or sloppy. I work real hard on my presets and if you don't like them tough. i consider my new work in 3d to be a achievement in my standerds. because you want ot know somethin. i know absolutely nothing of Trig,Geometry or algebra. but i struggle to learn enough so i can atleast make beautiful presets.<br />
      <br />
      again sorry if i over-reacted.<br />
      <br />
      anyway Jheriko i look foward to working with you if i ever get the chance to do so.<br />
      consider me a friend.<br />
      now i'll officialy shut up on this post.</p>
