      </blockquote>The visualizer is in use for quite some time in commercial environments and those blokes do not like to do anything themselves. If I get enough interest from private users then I'll add scripting. If there is no interest then why bother?

      <br />
      a) comes with winamp<br />
      b) is programmable<br />
      <br />
      almost everyone who comes in here wants a hardware accelerated version of what AVS does. quite a few people i know (myself included) only use winamp because it comes with avs, because avs is scriptable. if you did add scripting it would set your visualiser above the rest, plus with a community of artists making presets for it you wouldn't have to bother updating the visuals yourself.<br />
      <br />
      if you do decide on making it scriptable i will warn you that finding a suitable scripting language will be ... er... fun ;)<br />
      <br />
      sorry to write your vis off so quickly, but i just have little interest in visualisers that aren't programmable in some way<br />

      </blockquote>Every technology has it's good and bad sides. If you just want to accelerate AVS then get R4. I have no intentions of replicated something that is already done hundred times.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>I have no problems adding scripting. However it does involve some work and before I do it I want to know if people like the concept in the first place. If they just say nah then why bother<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        , plus with a community of artists making presets for it you wouldn't have to bother updating the visuals yourself.
      </blockquote>I have to. I use this visualizer in the commercial environment and I can not use somebody else's presets without making agreements and paying the authors. And if I got 100 authors that'll be a nightmare.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        if you do decide on making it scriptable i will warn you that finding a suitable scripting language will be ... er... fun ;)
      </blockquote>I have one. It is full blown language and compiles to native code. Leaves interpreters in the dust. Also majort part of visualizer is scriptable using HLSL (High Level Shading Language) which is executed on video card directly.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        sorry to write your vis off so quickly, but i just have little interest in visualisers that aren't programmable in some way
      </blockquote>No problem. I do not expect people to fall all over. If they like it good. If not, well I am still getting paid buy using it in commercial environments.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        btw, you should try to make the graphics features scale down onto lower end cards. it might also make it more popular.
      </blockquote>No. I believe I should not. I want my presets to look the way I design them and lower level hardware just does not cut it. Besides those things are getting cheaper and cheaper while giving more power. So at one pint what I do now would be possible using just on-board hardware and can certainly wait. Btw the cards that I need are being released by millions in quantity. So there are people with the hardware;)

      You're really making it hard for yourself to make this a popular product. I understand that you're proud of what you made, but if you want this to get an audience bigger than just you, at least equip it with some wings before you send it flying over the internet, even if that would be a free, stripped version. (I guess that's what you're aiming for? a free and a (paid) full version?)<br />

Shapes colors bump-mapping and lighting that you see are all generated at runtime using pixel shaders. t does run on 6600GT for example but with low FPS. It does have "light" mode where one layer is removed and it is possible in this case to use it on 6600GT.

        <p class="post-content">I will check out R4 when I get home, but it doesn't look very programmable.<br />
        <br />
        The geometry is very nice and the lighting looks reasonably nice, but there is nothing in this image that can't be done using PS2.0 and a lower specification card in a lower resolution with a less detailed model. I'm probably going to download your plugin when I get home after all this discussion just to see how good it is when moving.<br />
        <br />
        Bump-mapping and lighting don't make things slow. Accessing large textures and rendering with a high polycount is more of an issue normally, especially on lower end cards like GeForce FX.<br />
        <br />
        I understand that its annoying to make stuff scale nicely, I'm always trying to do it and its time consuming and takes the fun out of the code (not that I've finished anything big yet). There are somethings which are quite easy to do on PS3 compared to 2, such as omni-directional shadow mapping. (I've never been able to make it look good on GeForce FX) The reason to make things scalable though is that it opens up your software to a larger chunk of the market since, for instance, home users do not have high-end PS3.0 cards as a rule.<br />
        <br />
        Anyway, you remind me that I must take the time to sit down and write a proper demo. If my guesses are right and you are using some light with normal mapping, specularity and some kind of parallax effect (there is a nasty patchy aliasy border around your model that I can't explain any other way) in which case its nothing I haven't done before on other models in different contexts both hardware and software, real-time or not. Also nothing I can't derive from first principles. So there is no good reason other than sheer lazyness (maybe lack of time from full time work but..) that I can't copy paste my existing code and throw together a demo.<br />
        <br />
        EDIT: didnt realise how long that was!<br />
        <br />

          <i>Originally posted by kostyap</i><br />
          <b>I would recommend you to refrain from assumptions like that.</b>
        </blockquote>Its not an assumption. As a trivial example: if you have a fixed view point for instance, you can neglect considering the back halves and occluded areas of models without doing any bfc/occlusion tests. If you allow the user to choose a view point you can no longer do that without resorting to expensive tests which are often not possible to perform in real-time without expensive pre-calculations (hence generally useless in this situation).<br />
        <br />
        Also I'm not doubting your scripting language, evallib already exists and compiles to reasonably fast code (no MMX, SSEn instructions...) in memory. All I'm saying is that there is a world of difference between rendering something to the screen without allowing it to be programmable and allowing it to be programmable. As mentioned above optimisation becomes much more difficult since your program knows much less 'ahead of time'. More importantly though is that rather than creating single instances of some object and using them you have to write code that manages multiple instances, creating, destroying, rendering from them (inheritence is nice here) etc... which isn't difficult, but its time consuming. You need to scan directories to look for files, create and maintain lists/trees in memory etc... None of this is necessary or even desireable for a stand alone plugin with fixed options.<br />
        <br />
        A simple example of this is texturing. With hard coded scenes there is no reason to give any general mechanism to link together the various components of textures, you can just assign which ever one to which ever texture unit you like, and then use them as you like within shader code. Its faster and easier to write this way, at least it is how I would do it for a stand-alone demo. Its also very little work to add specific optimisations for a specific texture.<br />
        <br />
        In a more general model though it is preferable to have some kind of script which defines the texture components, blend modes, which shader it needs to be rendered with etc... this means having to find all of these files out of a directory, parse them and store the data in some structure for fast and easy access, you also have to write more generic rendering code so that a texture appears on the screen. For all of this to be useful there needs to be some kind of UI for selecting a texture file and some mechanism for applying it to an object. Then there is allowing custom shaders for textures and working out which texture will end up in which unit etc.. This all boils down to needing some base class (without OO function pointers or whatever) for any component (triangle render, line render, spectrum, moving particle etc..) using textures. The bottom line is that you usually end up with a much bigger 'mess' of dynamic allocation, inheritance and data structures that you would need in a non programmable vis.<br />
        <br />
        If we decide to make it scalable as well it becomes even messier since many routines will need to be written multiple times for different targets to allow the program to exploit the better features of newer hardware.<br />
        <br />
        Ideally you would end up with something like the Quake 3 .shader or Doom 3 engine .mtr files.<br />
        <br />
        You can of course do all the above with a static renderer and get benefits and since I haven't seen yours yet I can't comment on it specifically.<br />

        </blockquote>I guess I should have been more detailed about what the program does. "Hello" World doesn't really compare to even an empty window (assuming Win32). Here, this one runs on *nix and Win32 consoles:<br />
        <br />
        <pre>
<code><br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br /><br />int main(int argc, char** argv)<br />{<br />    printf("Hello World\n");<br />    return 0;<br />}<br /></code>

        Sorry if I have offended you btw, I seem to do that easily without realising when I get overzealous about stuff.

        <p class="post-content">Just checked out your vis. It seems that all of the presets do the same thing but with different textures to me... I prefer the light mode a lot, the other mode is way too busy and the colours make it plain ugly some of the time. Also in light mode you can see the differences between presets more clearly. I'm also slightly shocked to see it so flat and 2d, I was expecting 3d and awesome lighting. TBH this looks like an incredible waste of resources.<br />
        <br />
        AA would be nice btw, it looks very jaggy here.<br />
        <br />
        Also checked out r4, it seems quite nice and very powerful but it lacks the key feature that makes AVS, which is allowing the bulk of the programming to be done through a drag and drop interface. although r4's language is nearer to c than evallib, which is nice. the r4 ui is also terrible, they wasted right click by having it do nothing :p I am probably going to play with it still.. but yeah.<br />
        <br />
        Relying on the sound card settings is quite annoying too. If the user can configure it then so can the software, enumerating windows and sending keyboard events is useful.</p>

        <p class="post-content">A few points:<br />
        <br />
        1) You are posting in the AVS forums; this forum is essentially dedicated to discussing preset editing. I appreciate that you just wanted to post about a visualisation in a place where you thought people would be interested, but <b>you</b> have to appreciate that everyone here is interested in scriptable, easily modifyable visualisations (and we put up with a huge amount of failings in AVS for it) so the reception is unlikely to be highly enthusiastic.<br />
        <br />
        2) Just because they make millions of high end graphics cards doesnt mean everyone has them. If you take a straw poll I think you will find a small minority of people actually own cards that new. I also agree with J that there is nothing in your vis that seems to require such a high end card, and if there is, it should be scalable. Its not good enough to just say "I want them to be seen as I made them" because you're basically saying "fuck the end user, you either watch it like this or you dont watch it at all". If you want people to watch your vis try to appeal to the biggest possible market.<br />
        <br />
        I dont mean to dump on your efforts, it all looks very nice, but as I have said we are more about making visualisations here than watching them.</p>

There is enough space for everything I think. As for scalability I could throw it back to you: if I put AVS full-screen on HI-Res monitor and throw some fancy formula's it just does not work, I can assume then that it is not scalable either. See there are small cars, trucks, race cars etc. What you are saying is that everyone should have the same car.<br />

        <br />
        PS. You can grab new version from website. This one optimized more and "light" mode should run on lower cards. Still requires shader model 3 support

        </blockquote>I take your point that vis' all have strong and weak points but personally I do feel that there is a sufficiently large home market out there for highly gfx intensive visualisations. Your argument that AVS isnt scalable is spurious, AVS is bordering on obselete, having not been updated to take advantage of any significant modern technologies, however up to the point it stopped being updated it scaled down very well, I believe AVS runs pretty well on any system down to about 166Mhz. Plus despite not taking advantage of modern technology, AVS still runs on essentially ANY system made in the last decade.<br />

        </blockquote>"Light mode" should run on nVidia 6600GT and ATI X1650XT and those are very far from being "tip top".Besides i am in no way counting on any immediate success in consumer market. The main goal of me building it was that it complements my other products that are used all across North America in commercial environment. As for consumer market I can simply wait for a year and these cards would be just a basic. Another use of that vis is that it can also work in non real-time mode and create super high quality images with the resolutions like 10000 pixels. As soon as I finish that part I am going to start selling those.<br />

        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>That is advantage but it is also rock tied to your feet. You can also notice that while AVS hogs CPU like crazy my vis practically does not consume any CPU time. It was very important for me since when embedded in my other software there are like 20+ simultaneous independent audio-zones along with video and some other stuff.<br />

It has built in scalability mechanisms so I'll be safe in the future in this regard.

        <p class="post-content">i don't see why the discussion is running so hot here. avs is fun, but the interest in it certainly went down a lot in recent years. media-players like itunes and even wmp have overtaken winamp long ago. it's sad, but it's a fact. for me it's only natural that a good visualization software has higher hardware requirements. the competition is high and that's good. a lot of people just buy latest graphic cards to run the latest quake or unreal, a lot of people enjoy special-fx in hollywood movies. of course technology is not all, it takes creativity also. for avs there are a lot of crap presets, that look very alike. even these are quite popular within winamp users. in avs there are also some extremely skilled preset makers, that hardly get the deserved attention. because people prefer to look at hires visualizations, even if the creativity in the presets might be lower than some high-end avs. the opening of the avs source came years too late, and now nobody is interested in adding some new features (only simple options have been added so far) or even optimizing the code. hell, i don't know what i'm even talking to, i just think that both plugins talked about here have their founded legitimity to exist. would be nice to see that skilled work together, rather than just calling the others development worse. it's not easy to get together.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Its getting a bit off topic but I think the music visualisation (home) market basically doesn't exist. I remember when I first saw geiss thinking it was seriously shit hot, but even then I probably spent less than an hour in total ever sitting and watching it. Music visualisation is such a background entity that I imagine people are unwilling to pay for it, I know I certainly wouldn't.<br />
        <br />
        As I have mentioned earlier in the thread the sole reason AVS has a community is the customisability of it. Milkdrop is customisable to a lesser extend and it has a proportionally smaller community. You could argue that the biggest music vis community is the demo community where the visualisations are entirely bespoke and innovation is cherished. Naturally community size is not a direct measure of how 'good' a visualisation is, but it arguably reflects popularity and mass appeal of that type of visualisation. Given those metrics, AVS fares well in comparison with other 'better', closed source visualisations.<br />
        <br />
        I would go as far as to say the ONLY reason I use AVS is because I enjoy making presets. I enjoy watching other peoples presets as well, but most of the reason I enjoy looking at them is because they are often presenting something I have not seen AVS produce before, thus inspiring me further. AVS is a toy to me, and I think the home market for a dynamic visual toy that responds to music is bigger than the home visualisation market can ever be.</p>

        <p class="post-content">It saddens me that people are actually suckers enough to buy such a breathtakingly unspectacular vis program. Whitecap from the same company is actually a superior vis because of its scripting system which was pretty good I used to think. I doubt they make much money selling visualisations like that (not that I would really know) however all that really proves to me is that there are a lot of really stupid people out there willing to pay for things that are inferior to things they can get for free.<br />

        "I have spent the last few hours getting acquainted with G-Force, and I must say that for the money this is a real bargain.

        Whats more is that kostyap has a bad attitude, rather than giving nice thought out replies he has snapped out irrelevant and arrogant comments without reading the post before properly (or at all) and without much correct terminology or knowledge. There has been little or no explanation or justification, mostly just rude comments.

        <p class="post-content">So the sales team at G-Force got their software bundled with WMP, the default player shipped with Windows, and iTunes, the default player shipped with macs or bundled with iPods. Two media players that by their ancillary nature have almost no requirement to be any good, and by extension (if not more so) their visualisations.<br />
        <br />
        Congratulations to their sales team for some good business sense but its hardly the voice of the consumer. The customers they get to their website are almost certainly ignorant users of WMP and iTunes who are unaware that other media players exist let alone other vis's. It might as well be a captive market since the customers are trapped in a padded cell of their own stupidity.<br />
        <br />
        I conceed that within the original context of the discussion, yes, G-Force has probably made lots of money for the company; but not through any particular virtues of the visualisation software.<br />
        <br />
        Maybe I'm wrong about the home vis market, dunno.<br />

        </blockquote>I think that there is an attitude in here. It may be difficult to talk to people that call their potential customers ignorant. I suspect it could be the other way around. And I am pretty sure that many home users tried Winamp with Milkdrop for example. Many of my friends do use Winamp. They usually run Milkdrop though rather then AVS. When I asked them why they told that in their opinion Milkdrop looks better and has authors that produce better looking presets.

        </blockquote>They aren't my "potential customers", I have no interest in selling visualisations to the public; I'm just presenting my take on the market and that product in particular. If I was interested in selling visualisations it would be in the customisable visualisation vein which would be pitched at a slightly different market. I can imagine producing visualisations for the commercial sector as being fairly interesting on the other hand (which I sort of gathered you are associated with in some way).<br />

        </blockquote>As I stated before, most people use AVS purely for the customisation and community; Milkdrop is superior to AVS in many ways for the sitting-and-watching visualisation user. The AVS/MD comparison isnt really relevant to my comment about ignorant G-Force users though because those people have actively chosen a particular vis instead of just lumping one they got by default.

        <br />
        iTunes uses a really old version of G-Force as their visualiser. It has been there for many years 4+.<br />
        <br />
        WMP use their own inhouse ones (at the moment anyhow) from mostly years and years ago. Andy/Soundspectrum/G-Force did not do anything for WMP player. (Although they did do something for Media Centre.)<br />
        Besides G-Force would not meet their strict technical requirements for visualziation products within WMP (or the XBOX360 for that matter)<br />

Did you personally find it boring because it does not offer preset writing interface or because you just simply did not like the concept? In any way I am contemplating release that will let people write presets. It'll take me 1 to 3 month depending on how much of my time my other commitments will take away.
