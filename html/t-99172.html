Unfortunately I removed it because it was my first work and not really impressive. I didn't keep the presets either<br><br>It seems to me that the scope in the preset above is the one I made. I recognize it can fully explain how it works:<br><br>px=r*(2*cos(al)+sin((al+t*2)*m));py=r*(2*sin(al)+cos((al+t*1)*m));<br>al=i*tpi;r=(i*n%n%8);r=if(equal(r*(b-1),0),0,sh);pz=r*9;a=if(equal(r,0),1,r);x=px*cy+a*sy;y=py*cx+a*sx;<br><br>It draws a spirograph shape in (px,py) for the point in angle 'al'. The spirograph shape has a multiplication factor 'm' which changes to provide different shapes (triange, flower, star, ...). This is the projected shape.<br>To make the beams of the laser, the scope goes back to the center point every 8 points. That's what r is for: a counter. This causes the laser to look like a broken up shape at the edges, where 1/8th of a piece is always missing.<br>There's an error in the code by the way. The 't*1' on the first line in the py assignment should be 't*2' (like in the px calculation). It doesn't make sense to multiply with 1 anyway.<br><br>The code itself is very similar to my scopes. Using rx,ry,rz for rotation angles is nothing special: using 'rxo' as rotation increase offset is something different. I also notice that the code divides by constants rather than multiplying with the reciprocal. This is something I didn't know either at that time, so it's another indication.<br><br>There's also something about the cosine/sine calculations. It wraps the angle ry into a folling construct: sin(ry)/4;. This causes the rotation to be limited to 1/4th radians either way which is needed for the laser to point to the camera all the time.<br><br>It also uses numerical input of 'pi' (and 'tpi' as two-pi) rather than using acos(-1). My preset was made before tonic started using this technique, but it's very common now.<br><br><br>I'm going to look for my original presets... if I still have it I can confirm this rip, but until them I guess it's just my word against his. I sent him an email asking about the source: if he admits it, it can removed as well. I just think that the preset uses a few antiquated techniques which are well known today to be inefficient.<br><br>One explanation I can think of is that the person downloaded my mini pack of laser effects and used it, thinking it was a standard avs preset that came with the download.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th August 2002 08:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">If the Nullsoft people don't believe you...tell them someone who doesn't realize that not everyone puts their presets in c:\program files\winamp3\wacs\avs or whatever it was, he's probably not smart enough to create that scope in the first place.<br><br>Bah, ripping assholes....</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Rovastar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th August 2002 15:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>I beleive you at least.:)</strong><br>Do you want the rip removed from the site Steve?<br><br>I'll get it removed if you want.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th August 2002 18:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">If you don't object to removing something without hard evidence.
