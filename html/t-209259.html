      Man I know there must be such an obvious answer to this, but it will really save me a lot of time to know beforehand. Do I make the preset in the order I want things to appear (i.e., background elements first, then fore) or vice versa, or perhaps it makes no difference? (but I'm sure it does) Thanks for your help.:igor:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yes, the render order is from top to bottom, blended accordingly. You can change the order somewhat with buffer saves but dont worry about that unless you want to do 'advanced' stuff</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, with respect to render order it will render from top to bottom, however remember that trans elements above a render element will have the render element rendered over it, make a preset that has a superscope and a movement and swap them around to see the effect it has.<br />
      <br />
      If you need to render/trans a series of elements seperately from another series of elements use an effect list. If you want to save what has been rendered up to a point, use a buffer save. Then you can get that back with a buffer save set to 'restore'. I cant really suggest anything else important, you need to learn by exprimenting really.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I understand. That is a wealth of information right there. I am currently mixing different presets and tweaking them to see what happens, and I have already learned quite a bit. (Please don't worry, I am not someone who is going to try to claim releaed presets as my own whether they are mixed and/or tweaked or not). Thanks again. Excelsior!</p>

      <p class="post-content">ah, pak its always the same with you: if you don't know a good counter, you blame the opponent for using a bad english. However, i'm sorry to correct you, but actually "appendix" means the small end-thing of the intestines. <font size="1">(Besides, you should also keep an eye on your own spelling.)</font> :p<br />
      <br />
      Ok let's leave it with this. Somehow it's really petty to discuss about correct english and that...<br />

      <p class="post-content">like many words 'appendix' has more than one meaning my unpronouncable friend; When people use a word they very rarely mean the obscure medical definition ;)<br />
      <br />
      In fact now I'm even more confused by your post, you were talking about me lifting a narrow vestigial process projecting from the small caecum in the base of my abdomen? If thats a devastating medical quip thats gone over my head then I salute you sir!<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">well, it is to be feared that a discussion about the English language would a bit er.. unequal somehow. also i don't really like that linguistic/interpretation/meaning of words/etc. stuff. I'm more a scientific person, rather than an "arts" type.</p>

      <p class="post-content">actually your presets are very tech heavy so your scientific nature shines through. ;) btw what are your studies actually?<br />
      <br />
      well, with "art" i didn't find the correct word i was searching for. i meant that linguistic/philological area of science. However i think that i have a feeling for artistic stuff either. Not only concernig presets, but also in a musically way (i love to play piano and also improvise own new melodies).</p>

      <p class="post-content">im not sure what the correct english word is, since studies are different in the uk than they are in germany. Here the usal graduation are/were "Magister"(in humane science) and "Diplom"(in natural science). (most subjects are just about to change from that to the bachelor and master system you have in the UK for example). Well i'll try to explain how it works when you want to make a diploma: 4 semester "basical" studies", after/during that oral pre-exams, then main studies and after 9 semesters you make the "diplom-exam" (= written work + oral examinations). (Most terms may be incorrect, but i hope that you get what i mean, cause it seems as if there are no direct translations).</p>
