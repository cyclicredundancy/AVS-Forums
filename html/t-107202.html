      <p class="post-content"><strong>Superscopes...</strong><br />
      I don't understand this: I can't figure out the superscope...I tried to make my own superscope from scratch by making a basic pulsar from a sphere. I found in my geometry book a Volume equasion and thought that would work to make the sphere...(4/3)*3.14*(r*r*r). I just don't know how to make it work, and my Init is r=2 (anything bigger may go off the screen I think...) and It doesn't work: Black screen. Any help?</p>

      <p class="post-content">The equation for your sphere calculates the volume.. that's a scalar quantity, which won't help you draw your sphere.<br />
      <br />
      Instead you have to calculate the 2d coordinates of the points that represent your object. You can use x=cos(i*6.28);y=sin(i*6.28); to draw a circle.<br />
      <br />
      Note that the superscope will be squashed when the AVS window is not a perfect square. To counter this, multiply your end result 'x' by 'h/w' or the result 'y' by 'w/h'.<br />
      (w = width, h = height of the window)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If you want to learn superscope you could always look up co-ordinate geometry. If you want to draw spheres though you will need to use some parametric equation because standard cartesian equations (x,y) can only define 1 to 1 mappings. i.e. you can only have one y value associated with any one z value.<br />
      <br />
      If i'm confusing you then just play around with x=2*i-1; and y=some function of x. i.e, x=2*i-1;y=x*x; etc.. this way you can draw the graphs that you've probably been doing something about at school.</p>

      <p class="post-time small text-muted">28th September 2002 21:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p>

      <p class="post-content">So you haven't done any co-ordinate geometry?<br />
      <br />
      Okay well, I'll give a quick explaination:<br />
      <br />
      Firstly you need an equation, a quick example is y=x;<br />
      <br />
      On a graph were the x axis is horizontal and the y axis is vertical:<br />
      y ^<br />
      +3| /<br />
      +2| /<br />
      +1| /<br />
      0--------&gt; we draw a line through all of the points were x=y.<br />
      -1| 1 2 3 x<br />
      -2|<br />
      -3|<br />
      <br />
      Not a good diagram because it is ascii and it will probably get messed up when i submit. You can then convert this into superscope by doing:<br />
      <br />
      x=2*i-1;y=x; You will get a straight diagonal line going through the centre of the screen (the origin) which passes through the points where the x co-ordinate is equal to the y co-ordinate. (the superscope y axis is inverted with + at the bottom and - at the top so it will look a little different to my diagram).<br />
      <br />
      The way that this works is that i is a sort of length variable that goes from 0 to 1 so by multiplying it by 2 and subtracting 1 we make it go from -1 to 1. setting it to x means it will draw the line horizontally across the screen (along the x-axis) and setting y=x specifies for each x co-ordinate (-1 to 1) what the y value will be (x). Result is a line that passes through (x=-1,y=-1)...(x=1,y=1).<br />
      <br />
      If you have trouble with my litle intro here then look up cartesian coordinates on the net, you're bound to find something that you can learn from. After you're familiar with using cartesians then you should look up all of the functions that superscope has, like sin(), cos(), log(), atan()... to find out what they all do and what they look like as graphs of y=sin(x), y=log(x)...<br />
      <br />
      After that look up polar and parametric coordinates and then you will be able to create almost anyshape using a superscope, from a straight line to a sphere (and some even more complicated ones if you wish).<br />
      <br />
      Hope that that was useful.</p>

      </blockquote>yeah it is but, a better system is to multiply x with min(h,w)/max(h,w) or multiply y with max(h,w)/min(h,w), so if a person use a window with a bigger vertical window size then a horizontal window size

      Just simple:<br />
      <br />
      h1=h*whatever ; h2=h*whatever ;<br />
      w1=w*whatnot ; w2=w*whatnot ;<br />

      Rotation? uhm don't you do that in the scope code :) And you then add the correction code into the final result.
