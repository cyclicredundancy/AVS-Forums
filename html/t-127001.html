      Now im a bit curious...Which is the most complicate preset ever done ? Doesnt have to mean how many code lines.Just complexity.I like zevensofts matrix preset.It runs slow but its great.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Complexity is pretty hard to "gain" without using lots of code :)<br />
      <br />
      I don't know about complexity as in tech wise, but my most slowest preset is on the way in Bitmapped II. It uses a lot of simple dm's a couple of picture's, a couple of APE's such as colormap &amp; convolution. Well anyway it uses many small effects to create the final preset, i consider it quite complex even tho it doesn't use code anymore than maybe 10-20 lines (superscope included)<br />
      <br />
      I vote for Zevensoft's Ocean 3, it might not be as complex as Matrix Reality, but it looks so fucking sweet and going underwater is gotta be a really hard thing to pull out.</p>

      Anubis2003 :weird:<br />
      that polihedron preset of yours can NOT be on that list even if it took you dunno how long (but as said in your comment,it didnt) Because it's just plain BORRING. And besides you didn't do anything that is hard to do in avs.:P</p>

      <p class="post-content">i agree, there are two main things that make a preset good IMO, first complexity and technicality like for instance that but the other part is making it a fun preset to watch, and that isnt. Youve only met half of the requirements, still nice work though. Besides this isnt the best preset done its the most complex so it is a contender.</p>

      <p class="post-content">If Anubis' 120-polyhedra is included, then we can include Atero's Hyper/Supercube and my Beat Counter. We all know that they all are basically point-positioning, not quite the complexity we want (Though Atero's 4th and 5th dimension rotation can be a little plus).<br />
      <br />
      Anyways, I'm thinking of UnConeD's WolfAVSstein 3D (Slightly like the 120-polyhedra problem though...), Jello Cube (Mostly good syncing - disqualification?), and well... that's about all that I can think right now...<br />
      <br />
      I have nothing too complex in my upcoming pack in play (That and none of my presets are too complex to begin with), so I can nominate none of my works...</p>

      <p class="post-content">If I do make those sides work eventually (I've dropped the project for now), I'm gonna make a really cool preset out of it and you can proceed in WOSHIPPING me. :D<br />
      btw, nic, don't forget the simplex and cross polytope - intro to tff1.0 contains the orthogonal views (easy to convert them to projections - i have them stored in a seperate file on my comp as projections). the cube looks cooler than the rest tho :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">i do hypercubes, cross polytopes, and simplexes - cube, octahedron, and tetrahedron in 3D; octochoron, hexadecachoron, and pentachoron in 4D. cubes are easy - it's just connecting all the points with coordinates (1 or -1, 1 or -1, ...) to any other point with only one difference in the coordinates. cross polytopes are also easy - just connect every point (of which only 1 axis has a coordinate of 1 or -1, the rest are zero) to every other point EXCEPT the one directly axially across from it. simplexes are also easy - every point is connected to every other point, and there's only n+1 points in n dimensions. it gets a lot more complex from there :)</p>
