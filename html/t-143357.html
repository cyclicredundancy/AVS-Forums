(or lower it, i actually don't know the exact amount.) so if anything is playing - and thus any signal being sent to avs - then your switch will be on. point being that if anything it should be getspec(0.5,1,0), and that might not even work. however, i don't really think that it should be a straight on/off switch because it would do the same thing for very quiet as very loud...which isn't exactly reactive. *unless* you're turning a scope off when there's no music. the only problem with this is that you get fps spikes when you turn a song off; you'll have to decide for yourself if that's acceptable in your preset or not.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2003 10:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ok, how about on=above(getspec(0,1,0),0.01)<br><br>im not sure what you meant excactly, but i cant see how getspec(0.5,1,0) would do anyhting of use, seeing as the bands are between 0 and 1 only, and this looks for 0.5 -&gt; 1.5<br><br>And i think he is looking for a way to turn the scope off completely , only when there is no sound, not necessairly no mp3 playing, if you follow.
