Code isn't everything but it sure does help a lot. I agree with what Jaheckelsafar said but I would also add that code lets you do what you want in AVS, ie. if you have a really cool idea for an AVS preset it isn't likely to be impossible with code.<br><br>The other thing that puts me off of noob presets is that I can look at them and see exactly what has gone towards making them without even opening the editor window.<br><br>Anyway, have fun in the world of AVS - and do use code, it is more than worth it.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd November 2002 14:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nic01 's giving a nice tutorial for starting coders.
