      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hi everybody</strong><br />
      Its been a long time, almost 2 years since i stopped making AVS presets. In fact, my computer use was limited to checking mail once a week. so, most of u guys might have forgotten me, many dont even know me.<br />
      <br />
      anyways, i have started again. i've forgotten most of the stuff and have to learn the new functions like megabuff, etc.<br />
      <br />
      anyway i was expermenting with waveforms and created 2 quite cool ones. its not a proper visualisation as such, just a preset to show the ssc's. the first one was created intentionally, it takes the average value of the waveform over a small period. the second one was an accident. take a look and tell me how you find them.<br />
      <br />
      they work specially well in pure instrumental or pure vocal songs. try the instrumental version of "in the end-linkin park"</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>hello</strong><br />
      i've not seen your work but i've heard about it from others. and also i hear you are pretty good the avs language and i was wondering if you would like to join Nanakiwurkz Inc aka Visualnoobs as the retro programer<br />
      to help create help files and junk to help the noobs learn avs better and faster then ever. if you decline thats alright but please consider it.<br />
      the reason for retro is because you know alot of the retro ways of avsing and well i'm just talking if you want a differnt pos just ask i'm currently open in every possible programmers position. even html programming for the site.<br />
      <br />
      just leave a message at the forums in<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ok, here it is, i made a small n simple preset out of these scopes. Nothing complicated, but i like them.<br />
      <br />
      the background scopes freeze to a new form everytime a beat is detected. looks quite good when the foreground and background ones overlap.</p>

      </blockquote>If you are using the modern winamp skin there is a button top right corner called “Video/Vis”, press it and you’ll get avs.<br />
      <br />
      If you’re using the old winamp skin press Ctrl-P, go to visualization, highlight Advanced Visualization Studio and press start and you’ll get the avs window.<br />
      <br />
      If you’re using the modern skin use the next and previous button to scroll through the presets.<br />
      <br />
      If you’re using the old winamp skin press "u" to scroll through the presets.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to start doing your own presets, you right click on the avs window and you click "Dock in avs editor". Now I am not going to start talking about how you are going to start doing you’re own presets.<br />
      <br />
      First you need to learn how to use avs and then you can start using avs for doing you’re own presets. Welcome to the wonderful world of avs.<br />
      <br />
