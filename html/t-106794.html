Even if you do gain speed from having to read less data, JPG is not very memory conservative when it comes to decoding it, so it'd be slower anyway.<br><br>As I said:<br><blockquote>A much faster approach would be to scale it once and keep that in a buffer (bilinear filtering anyone?)</blockquote>That pretty much explains it. Asidee from photorealistic images, AVS pictures tend to be low-color ones. Using a RLE scheme should give a minor speed increase as well.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Karnov</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th October 2002 18:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>BMP isn't good for ANYTHING</blockquote>i disagree<br>what if you are stuck at someone's house who doesnt have the money for nice editing programs, and doesnt have the bandwith to download them?<br>ill answer for you: You are stuck with MSPaint<br>that is one of the few occations when .bmp is ok<br>(and gif sucks) :p</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th October 2002 21:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Even paint can do GIF and JPG from Win98+</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Karnov</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">22nd October 2002 03:24 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">yeah but thats only if you are willing to navigate a pulldown menu<br><br>:igor: DoH! :igor:<br><br>(if forgot about that, and now i feel dumb)</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
