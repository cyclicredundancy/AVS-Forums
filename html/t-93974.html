class="post-content"><strong>wow</strong><br>Like UnConeD mentioned in your other thread, I didn't like it messing with the AVS settings. I must admit the flash intro was cool. Maybe a little overkill on the hype.<br><br>Man...How do people figure out how to write DMs like that?!?<br><br>I liked most of them (B&amp;W just isn't my thing). One that stood out &amp; caught my attention was yathosho__polydimorphium_(v.i.p).avs &lt;--- I liked it a lot. Another one I thought was very nice was venom. These were a couple of my favorites from the remixes 1 folder<br><br>I'd have to say the remixes 2 folder had some stuff in it that was waaaaaaaay better than the stuff in remixes 1. Especially the first 2 presets; after that, there was a streak that went to more like the remixes 1 folder. The next preset in remixes 2 that caught my eye was duo diode discharge (lux eterna mix). The next preset was a little too hyper and the colors weren't to my liking (even though the math in this and the other ones I didn't comment about being good is great math work-I'm sure of that. ----&gt;I don't understand it, but I'm just giving opinions on what I like to *look at* most, whether I understand how it works or not&lt;----very important sentence).<br><br>"Duo look in the mirror" was another preset I found visually appealing. Duo vertigo in the 60s I really liked (where's vertigo come in? I'm trying to figure out-but I couldn't even guess how to give the viewer the sense vertigo visually; I'd figure they'd just have to experienced it during a deep dive at night to know how it feels (I haven't personally, but my dive instructor has experienced the feel of it, (of course he knows how to figure out which way is up...just shine your light on the bubbles when you breath out &amp; see which way they go.)))<br><br>Enough about vertigo &amp; scuba diving...back to reviewing. s_kupers beautifully nothing was something...*laughs at own joke*<br><br>s kupers Exotherm is-...Wow!!!!- it's very appetizing to the eyes. If it weren't so insanely cool-looking, it would seem jerky. But it's nicely controlled. I hardly notice the low FPS on my computer, which is very nice.<br><br>s kupers lux eterna had a very nice DM. The more I watch it, the more I like it. It's cool the way it sometimes make a streak while it sometimes just re-replicates certain parts &amp; places them in other parts. Reminds me of looking at infinite copies created by mirrors across from each other, then changing into streaks instead of the copies. Very nice<br><br>nivea at first I didn't thinnk did too much (turned out it was just too slow to run on my computer at the window size I had been using on previous presets). Once I speeded it up, I saw it. Nice DMs in it (visually appealing; way to complicated DMs for me to understand...at least not yet).<br><br>Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...The next one is another I like as much as the first two in the remix 2 folder. A favorite! zen-x delirium (alien mind). Color combinations "too good to be true!"<br><br>The next preset I thought was quite sempiternally (look it up at dictionary.com) sweet was zen-x mathmos red (sunonoil rmx). :mad: I just wish I could understand how it works :) (jk about being mad). I like it<br><br>Smooth operator was a little hyper, but was very, very nice! (you keep surprising me by the quality of the stuff that I normally don't like!)<br><br>I'd like to know...What did you do!?!?! Throw an AVS party at your house? It seems so many different artists participated in this (either that or I'm losing my mind).<br><br>In short, an astonishingly great AVS pack! I'd love to hear some suggestions to improve some of my presets from someone with so much experience in AVS! :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th July 2002 14:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">thanks for the comment. actually a couple of artists took presets from my old full circle pack and remixes them. people came from netherlands, sweden, finland, united kingdom and the u.s.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
