      <p class="post-content">Haha this effect rules!<br />
      Though I would remove the front wall and let the ceiling/floor continue because it looks a bit weird when the light shines at the wall in front of the camera. If I were you I'd add some more patterns to the light (like non-square ones by blacking out some rays) and add a few more spheres floating around. The first time it crossed the beams I thought it was a bug. Or make the sphere larger.<br />
      <br />
      It looks pretty awesome when you add alternating high radius/low radius blurs w/ convolution to equalize the dots (see <a href="http://acko.net/dump/fsk%20-%20Vis%20Bizz%20(UnConeD%20Tweaked).zip" target="_blank">here</a>)<br />
      <br />
      By the way, is there any reason why the camera is not moving? If you're raytracing, what is keeping you from having the camera move around?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Some optimization tricks... replace:<br />
      <br />
      Det=-sqr(vb)+4*va*vc;<br />
      k51=(-vb+sqrt(Det))/(2*va);<br />
      k52=(-vb-sqrt(Det))/(2*va);<br />
      ...<br />
      ....if(below(Det,0), ...<br />
      <br />
      with:<br />
      <br />
      Det=-sqr(vb)+4*va*vc;<br />
      alpha=below(Det,0);Det=sqrt(Det);<br />
      va=.5/va;<br />
      k51=(-vb+Det)*va;<br />
      k52=(-vb-Det)*va;<br />
      ...<br />
      ...if(alpha,<br />
      <br />
      (sqrt is a slow operation)<br />
      <br />
      Oh and 'sqr(.5)' can be replaced by a constant too :). I'm not sure why dz=1.3/15 would be faster, but I think it's because of random fluctuations. Remember that depending on the position of the camera, AVS has to draw more and longer lines, so the speed can vary a lot during the preset. I think you got the wrong impression because of this.<br />
      <br />
      Also, I think it wouldn't be very noticable if you didn't raytrace the sphere in the volumetric beams scope, and it would be slightly faster. Oh and you need to make it so it is already moving at the beginning... a common mistake which makes the preset weirder on slow songs :).<br />
      <br />
      Now of course for the ultimate effect, you need to add a discoball on the ceiling that reflects the rays correctly... :rolleyes: just kidding (though reflections aren't *that* difficult actually), this is an awesome effect!</p>

      <p class="post-content">By the way, any reason you're using:<br />
      <br />
      k5=if(below(min(k51,k52),0),max(k51,k52),min(k51,k52));;<br />
      <br />
      and not<br />
      <br />
      k5 = k52<br />
      and thus<br />
      k5 = (-vb-sqrt(Det))/(2*va) ?<br />
      <br />
      Because of the way you calculate the quadratic equation (va always positive), -vb-sqrt(Det) will always be the positive intersection closest to the camera as far as I know, so you don't need to check for that explicitly.</p>

      <p class="post-content">And finally, if you replace:<br />
      <br />
      dx1=(3+ox)/(dx3);<br />
      dx1=if(below(dx1,0),-dx1,(3-ox)/(dx3));<br />
      <br />
      with<br />
      <br />
      dx1=(3/pp+ox)/(dx3);<br />
      dx1=if(below(dx1,0),-dx1,(3/pp-ox)/(dx3));<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then your box won't have black edges on the sides, but the rotation will not look squashed :).<br />
      <br />
      You seem to have missed a lot of common optimizations though. Don't divide by a constant, always multiply by its inverse (instead of x/2, use x*.5).<br />
      <br />
      Also instead of:<br />
      <br />
      x=dx/(1+(dz+8)/3)*pp;<br />
      y=dy/(1+(dz+8)/3);<br />
      <br />
      use:<br />
      <br />
      dz=1/(3.6666+dz*.3333);<br />
      x=dx*pp*dz;y=dy*dz;<br />
      <br />
      Multiplications are a lot faster than divisions, and doing a calculation once instead of twice is faster too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There two reasons for me not using all the improvements that you pointed out. The first is me not knowing enough about programing and math:),and the second one is the preset is not realy finnshed yet,I usualy edit the presets before the finnal publish in a pack and thats when I get rid of the devideing by the constants thing). I said this before and I'll say it again, I really had no programing experience before AVS, I got my comuter 3 years ago and started playing with avs about two years ago. At the time I couldnt even understand the examples in the SSC:D. I'm slowly geting there and Im loveing it. Thanks for pointing them out I REALLY apreciate it, I'll aplly all of them before the finnal realease and when codeing in the future:).</p>

      Tugg This is not really far away from a dm, actually its the same code just squezzed between a SSC grid and another projection, its like looking at a 3dDM from outside and at the end where the mapping usualy comes you calculate color valeues. You could easyly simulate a lamp and use the rays coordinates to calculate the texture(that would be static on the walls).I tried different stuff but this one had the best idea behind it :). You can make cool objects this way to.<br />

      <br />
      Youre code is very nice fsk. Very user friendly.. i cant find anything wrong with it that ucd hasnt pointed out..<br />
      though there are lots of optimisation thingys..<br />
      there is no reason why the volumetric beams should be that complex..<br />
      <br />
      i tryed to add more spheres, but i hit the var limit.<br />
      <br />
      heres a version with a solid sphere..<br />
      its not optimised yet though.. so its even slower than the orig.<br />
      <br />
      cant wait till you next pack man.. it will be something special..<br />
      <br />
      can we have another zvezda-ish scope perhaps?? i love that preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Try using deviantart I got pickin dim 2 from there. winamp.com is pretty weak for AVS because it is flooded with noob packs and because the serious artists tend only to release their major releases there.<br />
      <br />
      Take a look at all of the artists that you like there, you will probably find a lot of amazing AVS presets that you won't see anywhere else. For instance... on winamp.com I haven't published anything since J7, yet at deviantart I have about 7 or 8 newer presets.<br />
      <br />
      Also if you are serious about AVS you should get an account there because you will get *real* feedback (a decent amount of useful comments) from actual AVS artists there. Also you will get to see the AVS packs first, usually before they turn up on winamp.com</p>
