Also you might consider using different words than "noob" or gtfo, most people don't understand them. You could replace noob with "inexperienced" or "first timer", gtfo could be replaced by: "go find your answers" and all those DURRR's seem unnecessary, sometimes silence is stronger than mumbling. Also Jerk seems a bit weak of a word, try "stupid" or "idiot", they mean the same, but give a much stronger impression.<br><br>Overall, not bad PAK-9, but could use a bit tweaking :up:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Kar-mAVS</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th February 2006 08:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><font size="4"><b><u><i>THIS IS A JOKE</i></u></b></font><br><br>Edited as a compromise between Pak-9 and everyone else (Joking ;) ):<br><br>Hello, new and enthusiastic Jerk!
