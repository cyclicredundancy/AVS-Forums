If you are interested I have also made a rhombic dodecahedron which features in my Pack VI. My next pack will probably feature a couple of other solids, I did make a cuboctahedron but that ones already been done so I'm working on a icosidodecahedron (triacontrahedron with pentagonal and hexagonal faces - like a soccer ball) by using the golden ratio do determine its vertices and a rhombic triacontrahedron by using powers of the golden ratio.<br><br>Here are links to my the packs I mentioned above:<br><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/720677" target="_blank">Purely Platonic</a><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/743266" target="_blank">Jheriko - Pack VI</a><br><br>If you really want that animated gif as an AVS preset, I could do probably do it in wireframe, doing it solid would require that the vertices were ordered in a specific way (clockwise or anti-clockwise) but it is possible, I may give it a pop if I'm feeling mathematical later on...<br><br>Yeah your radioactive symbol was very good, if you want to fill it in I can give you some recommendations. To fill the circle the easiest way is probably to make your ssc go from the centre to one of the circle points, then back again, then to the next point on the circle... by using an alternating variable per point. I'd recommend that if you are going to do it, NOT to do it that way since although it is easy to code it will look like poo without a very high number of points, it would be better to make lines that zigzag across the circle by spliting it into two equal curves (vertical semi-circle then mirror it with x=-x would proably be easiest) and use an alternating variable to make it draw lines from the first point on one curve to the second point on the other back to the third on the first... and so on. You could fill the other shapes by mathematically defining them in a similar way since they are all symetrical, and since they are made of lines and circle arcs it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out.<br><br>:)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">3dino</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2002 00:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">jheriko :up:<br>very nice pacs!<br>hope, i will get more time for avs (shool work sucks! :mad: )<br><br>some nice links:<br><a href="http://www.polyedergarten.de/klintro.htm" target="_blank">http://www.polyedergarten.de/klintro.htm</a><br><a href="http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html" target="_blank">http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html</a><br><a href="http://www.georgehart.com/" target="_blank">http://www.georgehart.com/</a><br><a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/" target="_blank">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/</a></p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2002 00:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't suppose you happen to have any links which list polyhedral vertex co-ordinates, I'm gettig really sick of working them out, some of the larger ones take ages, especially when they have very little symmetry since you have to work out practically every vertex individually. :(</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2002 01:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Maybe you could model them in CAD/3DSMAX and export the coordinates as a textfile?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">11th October 2002 02:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Sounds like a good idea, but would those co-ords be nice numbers?

The degrees-to-radians conversion just uses pi or 1/pi, but no powers with absolute value above 1.
