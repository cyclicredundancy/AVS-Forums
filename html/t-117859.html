For those who don't know (maybe that includes everybody) i'm the author of pack like "Gonzalo's AVS Again" or "Gonzalo's OverRMXed Pack".... yeah... guess who... I'm Gonzalo. So if you downloaded any of these pack, i guarantee you'll see some cool things here. :)</p>

      Wow, man, you really know what you're doing - 4 star pack here. They really look like they could be sped up, but otherwise they're (mostly) original, aesthetic and (despite their lack of optimization) fairly fast. Three things though: If your preset needs an APE, include the APE (in the preset and the pack) and credit the author; number your presets and make your own installer; and make more presets - 10's kind of small for a pack.<br />
      BTW, how long have you been AVSing?<br />
      <br />
      Good luck, man :) I hope to see more from you.</p>

      Thanks a lot you guys, this really means a lot to me... now I know what to do next. I had some more presets ready just in case anyway... I've been AVSing since the beggining of this year, and I've relased 5 packs. Expect some cool aplha blending effects and such. Thanks a lot guys, you really gave me reasons to keep on doing this! Can't remember who said this, but, "Keep this digital art alive!" or something like that... Thanx, you guys rule :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Aah, great pack GMF, great indeed! Visually appealing and technically good.<br />
      <br />
      The fact that these are the first presets i see from you, impress me even more. Or... wait... i think i have seen your OverRemixed pack (or something like that), but i don't remember much from it and since i have deleted it from my avs folder... :rolleyes:<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, good work and hope to see more of it!<br />

      btw2. Yeah, maybe you should make a couple more presets, so there would be more eye candy for the viewers :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks there too :up:... I don't know why it crashes... Maybe the Color Map? Anyway... I think that Bumpy Carpet looks quite cool, but I'm not goin to discuss with Atero about me likin my presets or not... hehe. Ok I just need to know why don't you like Bumpy Carpet, cause the other one is out... Maybe I should optimize them? But they turn too slow, and that's exactly what I have to improve... Speed-up tips, anyone?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Include the pictures with the zip next time. I got them out of your previous zip but it would be nicer if I didn't have to.<br />
      Bumpy Carpet is alright. The carpet effect is nice, but it should change some or else the preset gets boring quickly. Also, the bubble stays centered on the screen; try making it move some.<br />
      Fractalish Colormania - The fractal has been done before, but I like your twist on it. The color effect is real nice.<br />

      Bitform Tunnel : :igor: (i dont feel so good)<br />

      Cromatized Slumps &lt;= I just love the movemest :eek:<br />
      Signs : Bit boring, make it more soundresponsible.<br />

      <p class="post-content">VisualAgnosia maybe the pictures aren't where they should be... check if hpipe.bmp and squares.bmp are in the AVS folder. Signs is only beat-responsive, I don't know how to make it more sound-responsive cause i'm no good at superscopes and i'm too lazy to learn, and there's no other effect I could think of to get that result. I think that's the thing that most of my preset kind of lack... the sound response. Brain Wash seems to be the most popular preset... That Biform Tunnel thing... I included it cause it was my first DM attempt, but it's kinda lame... that one's out. Thanks everybody for the support.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks there Anubis... and Atero yeah it looks ugly but I'm not too good at that... I'll do what I can, and I'll try to add more movement to the bump cause it's really static. The bitmap issue will be fixed when I relase the pack. I have a new version of 3D Cilinder ready, I think it looks a lot cooler... Enjoy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice work, good preset but maybe you could get it to move the lens around a little more. Artsy messy isnt bad, i made something similar a yesterday, i didnt think it was good enough but had potential, i ended up ruining it and not saving it, could use a little something else, like something more going on inside the lines or in the white bit. Anyway the rest of them are great, very nice work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I like bumpy carpet now, although I still think it would look a bit nicer if the shape of the carpet texture changed. The bump is now a circle, but it barely moves.<br />
      Artsy Messy is kinda boring. The color effects are nice, but it looks like I'm seeing the same thing over and over again.</p>

      <p class="post-content">New preset for you to enjoy... Some things to play around with:<br />
      <br />
      - If you want to see more action one slower songs, set the inner-most Fadeout to none. If you see way too much chaos, set that same Fadeout to something higher (Not too much though, cause you'll ruin the whole effect using too much Fadeout).<br />
      <br />
      - For some speed up, try disabling the 2nd effect list and the Brightness.<br />

      <p class="post-content">...And I was here thinking "Wow! I finally made a dynamic flow movement! And a cool color combination as well!"... I know nothing about Superscope coding, so I guess if I can't figure out some improvements for this one, that should be the end result (and maybe another preset out of the pack).<br />
      <br />
      And... I give up on Space Vert. I've been experimenting and thinking a lot to figure something out... but "3D" presets are just too much for my little mind. From now on i'll try to focus more on design... Sure, when get more knowledge (studying from other AVS artists and actually understanding the maths needed) i'll give it another shot.</p>

      <p class="post-content">nice, these look pretty sweet. Purple sunset is the best though, that is amazing 5 star preset there. Simplicity is too simple :rolleyes: you need to incorporate more shapes and change the colours a little more. Simplicity 2, same with this, it needs colour, this one looks a little better shapewise though. Good work overall :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Simplicity(1 and 2) - Too simple IMHO. Need something to make them more complex.<br />

      Those Simplicity presets are supposed to be that simple... I'll try to make them more interesting, but not more complex, to keep the original idea. And Purple Sunset is not synched cause I tried to make it as real as possible... You're supposedly not between two planes, just traveling through the water and the clouds just go where the wind leads them (maybe too fast, but it looks boring with a slower movement). Yeah, the sea and clouds are static, but I can't figure any way to make them move... They were made through static grains, but using moving grain looks ugly... Anybody has ideas on how to do this? Oh, and the DM on Simplicity is based on the Shiny Star alpha blend thing.<br />
      Thanks for the support everybody.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Zamuz, I would still do something to the simplicity presets. They are just too basic for me(it is all very predictable). Maybe if you had the shapes morph some more it would be better.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Made some changes... Lots of colors in Simplicity, and moving sky and sea textures in Purple Sunset. Well... they kind of move... it's more noticable without sound. Also, the movement range of the sea part is limited to prevent ugly edges between tiles (that didn't work for the sky though...) To make the clouds change shape slower, go to the inner most Custom BPM and set the arbitrary BPM to something lower. Enjoy.</p>

      <p class="post-content">They are lovely, zamuz.<br />
      Simplicity still has the same basic simplicity, but with an added level that makes for a very nice effect. - 4.0<br />
      Purple Sunset - The sky isn't static which is great. It kinda flashes some, but it is still very nice. - 4.0</p>
