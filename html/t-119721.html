It occurs in numerous semi-regular polyhedra because these shapes can often be derived from icosahedra and dodecahedra, sometimes in combination with other polyhedra.<br><br>For instance, if you wanted to find the vertex co-ordinates of a truncated icosahedron then you would start with the icosahedron and then figure out how 'far down' each vertex you must truncate in order to get triangles and pentagons of equal side length, once you know this then it boils down to doing 'vector type' math to find the x,y and z components of the line from the orignal vertex to the each of the five new ones in order to get the new co-ordinates from the old ones. What you will need to determine to do this is the internal angle of the icosahedron, which i can't remember of the top of my head but has something to do with phi too.<br><br>If you are still stuck then I can demonstrate how to do this for one vertex and then you can do the rest.<br><br>You can take the vertex co-ords from my icosahedron preset in my 'Purely Platonic' minipack.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2003 18:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks Jheriko, I finally figured it out though, I posted the truncated icosahedron already in this thread, as well as a 120-polyhedron in another thread.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2003 18:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">hehe... i just assumed that you still hadn't figured it out. sorry :P</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
