      <p class="post-content">Someone give me a huge stick, I need to beat VisAg in the head hard enough to change his personality. Either that or provide me with the ingredients, just replace the beef mince with a certain person.<br />
      <br />
      Anyways...<br />
      <br />
      No, you can't animate GIFs. Your best bet would be to make an Mpeg (Or was is AVI?) file out of it, and use it. As for Render/Slideshow, It currently crash my winamp... So I can't help you there.<br />
      <br />
      Hopefully that helps.</p>

      If I should be Banned, Mabey they should have a message at the front of the forums that says "A sence of humour that doesn't conform to Atero (or anyone elses for that matter) should not post comments HERE !" thus negating a large majority of AVS contributors which are needed to keep this whole thing going..<br />
      <br />
      I'll say what I like and in my own tast3 and if someone who my humuor is DIRECTED at is offended then I will withdraw it. But if you want to ban me I suggest you ban yourself and just close down AVS while your at it,<br />
      <br />
      And if your going to refer to my previous post by not helping or contibuting I can honestly say I didn't know but <b>if I did I would help</b> thats My way of saying "I dont know", It's still leaves the thread open for others...<br />

      FYI: You're not funny. In fact, you're completely useless. The reason I said you should do your own work is because it was a simple question that you could answer yourself if you had half a brain. If you don't have anything to say, then DON'T SAY ANYTHING. It's a waste of our time, and quite frankly if you have the time to write<br />
      "1 medium onion, finely chopped<br />

      our time is unimaginably more valuable than yours. Oh, and here's a tip: When you post something, try to have a point. It makes it so much more interesting to the reader.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hey dinamo h!<br />
      <br />
      But you can surely use an avi-file! if the pictures a not big it is ok<br />
      Use some compression stuff every windows-system has (Indeo 5 or something). You can do that with JASC Animation Studio for example...<br />
      Take a look at my old avs-preset to see how it works (I used the Cinepak codec, hope it works for you...) :</p>
