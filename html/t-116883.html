I've just read another 0 star comment on Whacko AVS VI, complaining that my presets suck once more. How nice. On top of that the writer is complaining that I voted on my own work. More detailed:<br><br></p><blockquote>That it is: Pride is excessive belief in one's own abilities, that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity. Your punishment in Hell will be: You'll be broken on the wheel.</blockquote>Aside from the fact that the author should get off his high horse and recognize that his stupid threats don't mean anything to a person who is not a christian fundamentalist, he's also irritatingly forgetting one thing: this is the only way I can reply to the people who crack down my work. There's no email link or any other way to contact a visitor who reviews, except to post a review yourself (which could easily be disabled by the admins if it was so bad).<br><br>If someone says my AVS presets suck, I'd like to defend myself (provided they use actual arguments), which is what I did. I didn't praise my work into the heavens, I simply pointed out some facts. Except of course the fact that I gave it 5 stars, because you're not allowed to give no rating, and because that's what the staff review gave me. The writer immediately concludes that I "can't stand critics".<br><br>What do you think about this? I think voting for yourself is overly enhanced by the fact that it says "blablabla gave it [5 stars]" which indeed makes it look like you're kissing your own ass. But then again, you must be dumb to ignore the whole slab of text below it that's validating those 5 stars.<br><br>Now onto another AVS-related issue... I'm tired of people complaining about reponsiveness in my presets when 90% of all AVS presets don't respond more than 'Use The Force' (all that is reponsive is the ship's rotation and shooting. Surprised?).<br>Seriously, take a look at the AVS components and how they respond to different things: moving particle is pretty random aside from radius; the 3D effect from dot fountain is usually so mangled by movements that you just see a bunch of swirly dots; etc. And as far as the oscilloscope or spectrum drawing scopes go, usually the signal itself is warped beyond recognition too. AVS is about things moving around, using the music as a generator for mostly pseudo-random movements.<br><br>I just don't see why people complain about this with my presets. Presets with just onbeat response have been around for ages, yet people seem to have the illusion that before complicated 3D presets, every pixel AVS calculated was 100% pure music. How come similar packs like Pickin Dim or El-vis' History (yes, it contains just as many unresponsive presets) get nothing but rave reviews, and I get stuck with assholes saying it's not true to AVS? Perhaps the answer is indeed "no style or visual appeal", but I'd figure I'd get nothing but 0 stars then.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">VisualAgnosia</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th December 2002 13:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>If I findem I'll knockem flat..</strong><br>Who said such a thing !!!!!!!<br><br>Hey UnConed If someone is havin a bitch because they have problems with their own life and think that someone who's proud of the work they do, needs a bit of a come down, it's probably because their father played the finger game with them too much as a kid.

Also, the user should be able to disable his own vote, like on DA. Lastly, no more than 1 vote per user should be allowed.

True, a lot of the more technical stuff (setting the code up to process information and render the graphics on-screen) are done by software processes (designed by Nullsoft's programmers) which interface with the drivers for the various computers we use (done by the makers of the parts for said computers), but those are the tools the artists (in this case, the preset makers) are given. What we do with them - and whether we share the art we create with others - is up to us.<br><br>Sure, some people may call our work poo-licious - that's their opinion, and they're entitled to share it, AS LONG AS THEY'RE POLITE ABOUT IT.<br><br>When it gets rude (as did the one jerk who threatened Unconed with "divine retribution", so to speak, for his [mocking_voice]"o'erweening pride"[/mocking_voice]), then I have problems.<br><br>The Winamp reviewers who looked over my presets said that they were good for a beginner in the AVS world (which is what I am), but they weren't rude about it - and I'll admit that next to Unconed, my stuff looks like redigested llama poo. If the reviewers had said what I just did, I bet they wouldn't be reviewers much longer! ;)<br><br>But I'm happy with my work - I think it's coming along nicely, although I stil have much to learn, and I'm happy with it. The reviewers who checked out my packs merely confirmed what I was thinking myself when I compared my presets to some of those done by people who've been AVSing for longer than I've been on the Internet! (Okay, so I exaggerated there - perhaps. It's still true!) So as long as people are polite when criticizing my work, I'll be happy - after all, I do my best to do the same when I comment on other people's work.<br><br>So I'd agree - have the user reviews moderated the way the forums are, and anyone who's rude and bashes the work they're reviewing should have their posts edited or removed, as well as having the rating they gave rendered null and void, and there should DEFINITELY be an option (for the component author at least) to abstain from rating his own work while still letting him defend it.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2002 19:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Obviously, you two have not spent hours on end trying to make your presets perfect, nor are you serious about your AVSing.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Clashman</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">7th December 2002 20:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Atero, Atero, Atero...</strong><br></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Atero</i><br><b>Obviously, you two have not spent hours on end trying to make your presets perfect, nor are you serious about your AVSing.</b></blockquote>It's not the amount of time spent, it's the outcome of the time spent. And no AVS routine will be perfect - after all, we're only human...except perhaps you, you seem kind of alien to me! ;)<br><br>The point of my post is this:<br><br>No matter what we do or how much time we spend tweaking this, fixing that, depixellating the other thing, adding alpha blending to smooth things out, removing the blur that makes things less defined, or whatever you do when working on a preset, there will always be a*holes who will say it still looks like crap, no matter what we do, and bigger a*holes who will threaten us with divine retribution/death/etc for defending our work.<br><br>Much as the one jerk who criticized Unconed did when Unconed defended the work he did on Whacko AVS VI, in response to some other idiot's much ruder version of the statement that the presets didn't react to the music as much as he would have preferred them to - and voted it no stars at the same time! I believe that the exact wording of this fundamentalist Christian <i>scheiBekopf</i>'s comment is in the post Unconed made to start this thread - something to do with being broken on a wheel in Hell, I think it was.<br><br>To paraphrase P. T.

All that it would need to do is store a load of stuff into variables from text boxes and then write that stuff to the file in the correct format. The slowness of VB wouldn't really factor much into that since you aren't going to be doing anything which is very processor intensive at all.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Clashman</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">15th December 2002 23:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hmm.

I'd be happy with 7/10, even. And don't assume that because I said that, I don't put hours of work into my presets, or that I'm not serious about it, because I do and I am. Maybe it's just because I'm new at this, and my opinions are worthless. :p<br><br>Anyway, I completely agree that there should be some way for the author of a pack to respond to comments without having to rate their own pack.
