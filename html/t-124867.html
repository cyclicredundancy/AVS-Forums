I already have turned down Ches Dragon's collab pack, but damn... i wouldn't want to miss this since i love devart and i spend most of my time there. Even more time than in the forums (sorry fellas, but you're not just that attractive ;))<br />
      <br />
      So devarts birhtday?<br />
      Deadline?<br />

      <p class="post-content">By the way here's the DeviantART logo traced as a superscope.<br />
      <br />
      u=i*.544;<br />
      f=below(u,.05);px=if(f,-.23,px);py=if(f,u*21-.61,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.05),below(u,.069));px=if(f,-.23-(u-.05)*21,px);py=if(f,.45,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.06899),below(u,.17));s=(u-.069)*31.4;px=if(f,-.61*cos(s),px); py=if(f,.45-pow(abs(sin(s)),.9)*.67,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.1699),below(u,.188));px=if(f,.61-(u-.17)*21,px);py=if(f,.45,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.18799),below(u,.209));px=if(f,.265,px);py=if(f,.45-(u-.188)*21,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.20899),below(u,.219));px=if(f,.265-(u-.209)*21,px); py=if(f,.0-(u-.209)*5,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.21899),below(u,.254));px=if(f,.065,px);py=if(f,.15+(u-.229)*21,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.25399),below(u,.294));px=if(f,.065+(u-.254)*21,px);py=if(f,.67,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.29399),below(u,.430));s=(u-.294)*23;px=if(f,.89*cos(s),px); py=if(f,.67-pow(abs(sin(s)),.9)*1.05,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.42999),below(u,.47));px=if(f,-.89+(u-.430)*21,px);py=if(f,.67,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.4699),below(u,.535));px=if(f,-.05,px);py=if(f,.67-(u-.47)*21,py);<br />
      f=band(above(u,.53499),below(u,.546));px=if(f,-.05-(u-.535)*20.1,px); py=if(f,-.695+(u-.535)*9,py);<br />
      py=py*.8-.1;<br />
      alpha=bnot(bor(band(above(u,.107),below(u,.117)),band(above(u,.3646),below(u,.3737))));<br />
      <br />
      The resulting points are put into (px,py) in AVS coordinates. 'Alpha' is zero where the lines should be black, and 1 otherwise. Because of this, the scope should be drawn with additive or maximum blending mode.<br />
      Depending on the amount of points you use to draw it, you might need to tweak the constants in the alpha line so that the scope's lines stop right at the D.<br />
      <br />
      If you're running low on variables: u and f are temporary variables and can be replaced by e.g. red,green,blue... If you don't need i elsewhere, you can even replace u by i (provided you keep the first rescaling line i=i*.544)<br />
      <br />
      I'm going to make an intro preset with this, because I don't have time to make a full on DevArt tribute... if no-one minds, this could be the pack's intro preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Jack: just make a cool preset... I'm sure you'll come up with something neat if you want to :)<br />
      <br />
      Btw here is my suggestion for the Intro. The scope is a 3D version of the one above, with connecting lines plus an optimized version of the beam effect from Whacko AVS III. Looks pretty rad :).<br />
      <br />
      I also added a credits scroller which will include everyone's name, and optionally some extra blabber.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The other preset is my submission for the tribute pack. I don't have much time to make a special preset just for the pack, so I took the hairy blobscope which I posted a while ago to demonstrate how to calculate normals. It's still pretty neat, and well Atero always said I should publish it as a decent preset :).<br />
      <br />
      Once this is published on DevART, everyone should immediately +fav it, so it will get noticed, get featured and give AVS a much needed PR boost :).</p>

      <br />
      Just wondering how many of you guys even are deviantart.com members and submit on the site? Im not saying it should be a criterion to participate on the pack, but im just wondering why are you willing to join into a tribute for site you don't even use? :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">UnConeD that is amazing. I was going to do about the same thing(without the volumetric lighting), but it looks like you beat me to it. The DA logo doesn't move very fast, so you may want to speed it up a slight bit.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's not like they *have* to be exclusive. If you want to release one in one of your packs, go ahead...just not before the tribute pack.<br />
      BTW, I do think it should just be people who use AND post on devART...<br />
      <br />
      Very cool intro, UnConeD. It's extremely slow, tho...I think that scope can just be somewhere from n=600-900 meself :) And there's the part where sometimes it rotates just a little to far, making the beam effect look really wierd....</p>

Here's a hint - the correct answer will always be less than or equal to the absolute value of your guess.<br />

      <p class="post-content">What about this one? And in Electric, to get circles instead of horizontal lines, go to the movement inside the 2nd Effect List and disable the "Rect. coords" box. If you don't like that either, just disable the 2nd Effect List. You get rid of the lines and get some FPS :)</p>

      </blockquote>The ATI Radeon 9700 pro only outperforms the GeForce FX 5800 when 4xFSAA is enabled, otherwise the GeForce FX 5800 is the faster card. Also the GeForce FX can manipulate 128-bit colors and is much faster overall when the hardware accelerated functions are used.

      <br />
      - Why do the arcs have a zigzag filling but straight lines don't? Inconsistency is generally a bad thing. Also, the bottom part of the D's arc and the upper part of the R's arc don't meet the end correctly.<br />
      <br />
      - The beginning/end of the arcs is missing the connection between the front- and backprofile of the letters<br />

      <p class="post-content">Fixing the aspect ratio means that you make your scope look right even if you look at it in a rectangular window. Otherwise your scopes will look squished, circles will be ellipses and rotation will look weird.<br />
      <br />
      You need to multiply x by h/w <u>or</u> y by w/h. Or you could use min(h/w, 1) and min(w/h, 1) and multiply both x and y, or use max.<br />
      <br />
      Depends on how you want to fix it (always stretch x, always stretch y, stretch smallest, squish largest).<br />
      <br />

      I like it a lot to. I have been trying to write simple and tight code to improve on my programing skils. This preset includes the tightest mosaic and solid scope code I can write at this time (any input on how to make it even better is grately apreciated). The only part that sucksorZ is that the scope and the (beautiful:)) squares can't be rotated:(.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well don't start bitching when the noobs m,iss the FAQ more as the forum is full of stickies. I culled a load of sticked in GD a while back and although not popular by some it was the correct thing to do.<br />
      Stickies are for important stuff/short term stuff IMHO.<br />
      <br />
      Still don't think these 2 'tribute' threads are really needed. Maybe it is also beacuse I hate DA site is there a slower site on the Internet.<br />

      BTW it is bad form to ask one mod and then ask another. It is like a 5 year old asking his dad for a special treat and when he says no he goes running to his mum.</p>

      <p class="post-content">As I'm sure all of you who intermittently check devart for notes und crap, Spyed has posted a link on your user page to two of his journal entries. Read them both if you haven't already :)<br />
      <br />
      Now then, I'm viewing this tribute as wholly more important as of reading them. If you're planning on doing anything...work your ass off. If you're not planning on doing anything, but you are a devart member/user, do something now, or else I'll shake my finger at you. :igor:<br />
      <br />
      The two things I'd request from EVERYONE is that 1) you start posting comments in their presets for this tribute, and that you post something for a comment on the intro; and 2) you keep your presets DA related.<br />
      <br />
      Now, anyone that's posted anything, please please PLEASE don't get me wrong when I say this. The only really good presets I've seen for the pack that are DA related are Nic01's probe (assuming he gets it fixed, of course), FSK's Squared remix, HF's Dreaming of That Green, and UnConeD's intro (I'd say my Cubism remix as well but nobody's commented on it yet). I have (or at least I think I have) seen all of the presets in this post. That's 4 (or 5) presets total so far. Keep making them! And if you posted and I didn't mention you above...make more! NAYAH BITCH.</p>

      btw: remove the multiplier (in *my* preset) and you got your ugly devart colors. :D<br />

      Due to the extreme and unadulterated laziness of you guys, we've got 13 presets (kind of) and something like 2 comments (kind of). I've washed my hands in this project. Someone else can pick it up if they want.<br />
