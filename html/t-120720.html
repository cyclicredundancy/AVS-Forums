      Okay...Here's the story:<br />
      I was working on this preset (Fistfight) for about an hour last night, getting everything nice 'n perfect, and while checking it, I switched from docked to windowed mode. Winamp crashed. Note that I was not editing code or adding any components or refreshing an editor window or anything like that - I was switching window sizes. This shouldn't cause any anomolies in the actual calculations (since I don't have any size-change triggered events). I reopened it, and it was on another one of my presets - the preview from TFF2.0, if anyone's interested - and Winamp crashed again. Assuming it was a problem with AVS and not my presets, I restarted. The preview from TFF2.0 works now, but Fistfight still didn't. I checked for too many variables and/or division by zero - there was none. I tried deleting vis_avs.dat, it didn't work. Can someone please tell me what's going on - if there's a problem with the preset (and if so, what), or if it's just my system?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Works fine for me. The only asumption I can make is that there is some resolution bug in the colormap.<br />
      Btw. its a very nice preset.</p>

      <p class="post-content">how can you tell? were you able to get it running?<br />
      i really want to figure out how i can get it running, at least temporarily, so i can fix the problem; right now AVS crashes when I load it.<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit&gt; This is really starting to piss me off: I moved colormap.ape out of the AVS directory (so it wouldn't load), and the preset worked fine. I proceded to delete the Colormap entry, and it continued to work just fine. However, when I remade the Colormap, it worked fine while i was watching it - but once I tried to restart it, it crashed! Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this??? &lt;/edit&gt;<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit2&gt; The saga continues. I was just able to load the preset without a problem, and reset it, and change window sizes, and everything. Even under different songs. Ay'm sho kunfyuszhedd.... &lt;/edit2&gt;<br />
      <br />
      &lt;edit3&gt; Well, it crashed again, but this time I was editing the superscope. I guess I'm not gonna do that anymore. &lt;/edit3&gt;</p>

      <p class="post-content">Atero, my preset "White Frame" originally had a colormap, but it crashed every time i tried to open it. While i was editing it it worked fine and the colormap would work fine, but save it and re open it and it would crash. Renaming the colormap, taking away the "unknown render" away while at it seemed to be the only way to remove the colormap and make the preset work again.<br />
      <br />
      I don't know the solution, but the problem seems to be the colormap. Just don't use it :p</p>

      <p class="post-content">yes, well, the problem is: colormap rox. and i wouldn't want to have to bug unconed into debugging it, since he's pretty much dropped AVS entirely (as far as I can tell) and has moved on.<br />
      (read: i want to find an easy solution that will let me be confident in the fact that i can release this preset (which, if you haven't noticed, kicks ass) without people bitching at me cos it freezes.)</p>
