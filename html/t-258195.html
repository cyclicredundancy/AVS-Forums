      hey,<br />
      <br />
      i'm a newbie and my question is probably stupid but i have read some and i don't have find an answer to my trouble....<br />
      so...<br />
      <br />
      in the configuration box of avs<br />
      i have put a nearly total alpha blending level<br />
      and it s ok, i have saved the preset and "load" in a hotkey<br />
      but when i m restarting winamp and start avs the level of alpha blending isnt good<br />
      i become as "default" alpha blending<br />
      <br />
      my question is "how start a visualization with avs with a defined level of alpha blending,..."<br />
      <br />
      sorry for this questions,... but i need some results....</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>alpha blending /isn't saved//commandline</strong><br />
      first i would like to say thank you for your answer, :)<br />
      <br />
      i would like give some explications...<br />
      else if i made the setting of the alpha blending level for an only one preset<br />
      i encourred a problem with alpha blending level :confused:<br />
      <br />
      if i have only one preset charged<br />
      and not in ramdom mode<br />
      my only preset is keeping on screen...<br />
      if i go in avs editor<br />
      in settings menu / display<br />
      and i put a alpha blendig level<br />
      for this only one preset<br />
      the screen is showed with the alpha blending i have put...<br />
      i save the only preset with a hotkey...<br />
      <br />
      now i closed the player,...<br />
      if i restart the player and call the visualization preset i have put my alpha blending level<br />
      it reappears with the alpha blending level by default<br />
      this is the same thing if i load the preset i have saved by the hotkey<br />
      the visualization reappears with the aplha blending level by default<br />
      <br />
      is there a possibility that the preset i have saved ( with the correct alpha blending level) reappears with the settings of the alpha blending level<br />
      i have put elsed when i restrart the player...<br />
      <br />
      is there a possibility to make the appropriate setting for the alpha blending by commandline<br />
      <br />
      i pose these questions for an idea for an integrated way in a<br />
      front end interface...<br />
      <br />
      thanks for the future answers,...</p>

      <br />
      and while your at it, fix all the bugs. kthx<br />

      <p class="post-content">Just out of curiosity: what does the use of hotkeys or the specific selection of the preset have to do with this?<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Alpha settings are set for the AVS window and are completely seperate from the loaded preset.<br />
      <br />
      a question in return:<br />
      - start Winamp<br />
      - start AVS<br />
      - open the AVS editor<br />
      - change the alpha blending<br />
      - close the editor (make sure random preset switching is off)<br />
      - close AVS (keep winamp running)<br />
      - (re)open AVS<br />
      <br />
      is alpha blending active now (it should) or has it been disabled?</p>

      Are you by any chance using any third party plugins? does it occur with all skins?<br />
      <br />
      If that doesn't help, then perhaps you could try a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=161361#clean" target="_blank">clean install</a>?

      <p class="post-content">sounds like something else might have a file lock on your configuration file, or otherwise that the file is read only. iirc the setting is stored in human readable form in avs.ini or vis_avs.ini. I am not at a computer that has winamp, or the ability to install it so I can't check :/<br />
      <br />
      I would recommend going into the file and altering the value by hand since this is where avs goes to look to find the alpha blending setting when winamp starts the avs plugin.<br />
      <br />
      If all else fails though, WotLs suggestion is probably the best. Do a clean install.</p>

      <p class="post-content">first thanks for your patience,..<br />
      <br />
      i have followed the advice of WotLs and make an clean install ...<br />
      <br />
      i have like result :<br />
      <br />
      when i restart winamp, avs restart with the good alpha blending level (transparency) :winamp: :up:<br />
      <br />
      but now i can't access to the alpha blending setting in the avs editor<br />
      i have put a "global alpha blending" to winamp and avs appears with this alpha blending.<br />
      <br />
      the result is the avs restart with the "global" alpha blending<br />
      i have put in the winamp setting alpha blending<br />
      <br />
      ...i have take a look into vis_avs.ini<br />
      it's readable for a human ( nearly ;) )<br />
      i have changed the transparency<br />
      (in the transparency in winamp preference<br />
      because now i havent acces to the alpha blending setting in avs)<br />
      several times and on each time<br />
      i have saved the vis_avs.ini<br />
      i have made a comparison between each vis_avs.ini<br />
      but i don't see any changes in the vis_avs.ini,<br />
      it s probably me who dont look good,...<br />
      or normal because the changes have been made in the<br />
      alpha blending setting of winamp,...<br />
      <br />
      ...after, i have put the different vis_avs.ini i have saved<br />
      in plugins folder of winamp but any changes in avs...<br />
      <br />
      i have take a look into the tutorials section but i havent seen informations about alpha blending for the display setting<br />
      for the effects there are some variables for the alpha blending who are explained but nothing about alpha blending in displays menu<br />
      <br />
      i need to understand...<br />
      <br />
      is the alpha blending setting for the modifications realised in the aplha blending setting in the avs editor<br />
      is stored in vis_avs.ini<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      ...<br />
      where the "global alpha blending" setting for winamp is stored<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      sorry for this situation but i need to understand what 's happens with the aplha blending<br />
      in avs and winamp...<br />
      <br />
      one more time thanks for your answers and your patience</p>

      <p class="post-content">Winamp's global alpha setting is saved in ..\winamp\winamp.ini<br />
      <br />
      It confuses me that the AVS alpha blending box <i>itself</i> has been disabled in the AVS editor with this new install.<br />
      I don't know what causes it but as long as that's disabled, then I don't think that even changing .ini's will do much.</p>
