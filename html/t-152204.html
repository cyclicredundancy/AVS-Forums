      OK spent some time integrating a few of Unconed and Tom Holden's simple APEs into AVS (Multiplier, Color Reduction, Channel Shift, Multi Delay, and Video Delay), and fixed a big evallib bug that was causing crashes. Now if you exceed the maximum variable count, things should fail very gracefully.<br />

      <p class="post-content">i'm using a resource-hacked avs.dll, which has quicker controls than the standard version, would be nice to see something similiar in the official avs.<br />
      <br />
      placing buttons will allow a way faster navigation, not only authors, also vjs will benefit from this. as you can see the new (kill) and "-" buttons were moved, so one can't accidently delete effects anymore (but i think the new avs has undo and a prompt now). i also recommend shortening or removing the full title of the avs-version in the bottom of the window, this allows to display longer preset-names.<br />
      <br />
      to save even more space one could replace the text of the buttons with symbols. since i made graphics that come with the official distribution of nsis, i wanna offer you making icons for these buttons... if required.<br />
      <br />
      would be nice to get some official feedback on this, justin!</p>

      <p class="post-content">man, if you can get things like colormap and texer in there, it'd really kick ass :D no more having to package them with every pack....<br />
      <br />
      btw what happened to 4 and 5? have i just not been paying enough attention?<br />
      <br />
      (oh, and can you make it so old presets will recognize the built in versions of the apes, so if someone doesn't have the ape (or does have the ape) it'll use the built in one anyway?)</p>

      <br />
      hey justin, it has been one of the oldest winamp bugs ever (since winamp 1.x!) and it still wasnt fixed.<br />
      <br />
      play the same track/playlist for several hours, and the timer starts counting the total time winamp was playing, instead of the time the tracks plays. i can't say at what point this happens, but it must be around 300 minutes :)<br />
      <br />
      or is this a feature after all?</p>

      <p class="post-content">lol, I never noticed that :). Two things: Can the Colormap and Texer put in it as well (since those are the two most-used APE's)? And a little more off-topic: Will wa5 have the multiple playlist ability as in wa3? That was one of the very few things that we're really good in wa3.</p>

      <p class="post-content">GREAT!<br />
      <br />
      Good to see someone's at least pulled it out off the dusty shelf and started some work on the mother!<br />
      <br />
      Good idea putting more coding hints inside the effect screens.<br />
      <br />
      Im finding it runs a heap slower though? Although I am having a few issues with my computer at the moment. My fps has dropped considerably, also, for some reason milkdrop now seems to corrupt whatever .dll feeds the sound input into winamp. Im not getting any beat detection. Ahh well... better get my fkn screwdriver out...</p>
