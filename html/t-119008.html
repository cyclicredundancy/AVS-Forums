      Actually there was no need, I just got bored so I came back and typed it up.:igor: Can't help it...<br />
      Well anyways,<br />
      Hope this damn one works...<br />
      You should know what to do with it and the fonts...</p>

      <p class="post-content">First of all, don't use fonts just because you can. Font effects are really boring, repetetive, and aren't useful for much since you can't display song names, etc. If you're going to use fonts (or APEs or bitmaps), make an installer. The Forward Flow 2.0 (get it <a href="http://atero.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">here</a>) contains an NSIS2 script which will install AVS, APEs/bitmaps, and fonts seperately, and for either Winamp 2.x or 3.x. If you have questions - which, if you don't know much NSIS2, you should - e-mail me at <a href="mailto:therealatero@hotmail.com">therealatero@hotmail.com</a>.<br />
      Get NSIS2 <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, my first thought is that you shouldn't do a bunch of monochromatic presets; instead do one color changing preset. Remixing one preset over and over again is just kinda tacky, especially if the pack is JUST remixes of one preset. Doing color-edits of the same preset and putting them in effect lists so it can be changed by the user are the best thing to do. Check out Degnic - Brock Flower, Nic01 - Elevated, and Tuggummi - Silk String 2 if you don't know what I'm talking about.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thnx man,<br />
      Like I said it was my first shot, you always gotta start somewhere. Now, where the AVS stands is an opinion left by the user of it. I rather like it but that's probablly because I made it. Hey at least I can get some feed back about it. As for NSIS I have no idea WTF I'm doing, hence why I just zipped everything and left it to the user.<br />
      <br />
      Well, I don't really care for song names popping up into AVS screen, that's why I turned them off. It gets annoying, you should know what your listening to.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, I don't really know how to cycle through a color list or something to make it continually change. I know some things have the option of multiple colors but not everything can do that. So, I guess I'll just have to work on it a bit.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ohh yeah,<br />
      Would you recommend putting an intro or something into it once I complete it? I see quite a few people that do that. I don't want to be a robotic slave copying everybody, but here it is anyway.<br />
      <br />
      Or does this just look hideous and should I take it out back with the 12 guage?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not really, intros aren't exactly necessary. But I would reccommend using an installer; the user shouldn't have to do anything extra (excluding downloading and opening the pack) to watch the AVS. I just posted the installer script on the general AVS forum last night, if you want to take a look at it. I would also reccommend getting some more presets in there (as in different ones), using less text effects, and using original code (instead of the example DDM)</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's really just a matter of fooling around and seeing what you get. Like I came up with a neat little AVS an hour or so ago. I think it's pretty cool. Thnx Again for the advice.:D</p>
