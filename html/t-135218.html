      Ok first you need to check out this component: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/components3/detail.jhtml?componentId=132995" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/components3/de...onentId=132995</a><br />
      <br />
      This guy just stacks up a couple of AVS packs and submits them in a collection, he does basicly nothing himself! All he does is to take others work and put them in a one download.<br />
      <br />
      I doubt that he has asked permission from the original authors and i doubt the original authors would give him permission.<br />
      <br />
      Can't the reviewers deny such packs from being published? Or do we always have to patrol the components section for such obvious rip off's like this one?<br />
      <br />
      And i don't care if it's an "award" thing or not, you don't go submiting others peoples work without permission!</p>

      <p class="post-content">The thing to remember is,not every reviewer knows every component/skin/preset that is published in the world, so it's very easy to publish something that is a direct rip off of someone elses work, I've done it myself on a number of occasions.<br />
      <br />
      If you see something that you know is a rip, and can back that up, head to the rip reporting forum and shout up.<br />
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=119" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/forumdispla...s=&amp;forumid=119</a><br />
      <br />
      Rips won't be dealt with on a forum by forum basis, thats what the rip reporting forum is for, to keep it all in one neat place that the reviewers can check without having to look through individual forums.<br />
      <br />
      Rest assured it will be dealt with if there is sufficient evidence to remove it.<br />
      <br />
      In answer to your other question, yes reviews can and do deny packs/plugs/skins from being published, but again it goes back to point one, they would have to know each and every single component that has ever been released, and that is a tall order for anyon</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, it's understadable. You have to be 100% sure. Also the reason why im posting this here is to ask did any of these persons involved gave permission to publish their packs in this collections.<br />
      Guess i should've used PM for that, but i also wanted to ask do the reviewers have any control over it.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the info.<br />
      <br />
      [EDIT]<br />
      <font size="2">In the collection there is work of the following people: Jheriko, Yathosho, Shreays Potnis, Gonzalo. It also includes the packs "Fr4Gs_AVS" &amp; "y-avs-pollution"</font><br />

      <p class="post-content">In the last period i`ve seen a lot of people trying to make packs like this one,filled with presets.Well,some of them DID ask for permission but why do a pack with other people`s work ? o_O Fast celebrity ?</p>

      <p class="post-content">first i thought there were only some presets of mine there, but my entire pack is there.<br />
      well, no one asked for permission to me but its fine as long as he gives credit to me...but since the entire pack with the installer is preset its ok with me</p>
