      VU meters, LCD peak indicators and spectrum analyzer. And some effects.<br />
      This is my first attempt. Dont' kick too much.<br />
      <br />
      BTW: I tried submit it. But got refused "not proper .exe file". Sure it isnt'. Looks like I must pack it and create .exe. But I have no even simple installer set. Where can I download it?</p>

      <p class="post-content">1: Good idea, one of the better VU presets I've seen so far. However, the background is crappy and the Timescope, being the ever-crappy component that it is, clutters things up and is extremely distracting. I don't like the color scheme too much either.<br />

      oh yeah, gourmet, u forgot to include the picture in the zip<br />
      i bet (hope) that the preset looks better when u add it</p>

      <p class="post-content">just skrink the picture down to 128x128 or 64x64 or less, that tends to make the file size reasonably small. If you are really stuck for space upload the picture seperately.<br />
      <br />
      Personally though I wouldn't use a picture for anything other than tiled textures or alpha maps.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, reduce the picture size. Most people don't run AVS above 400x300 anyway. Colour redution will help alot too.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Shrink down to size then. :)<br />
      <br />
      Try 128x128 and 256 colours.<br />
      <br />
      128x128x1=16384 bytes<br />
      <br />
      I cant remember how long the bitmap header is but that will be plenty small. You could even get away with 32-bit colour at that image size :)<br />
      <br />
      128x128x4=65536 bytes<br />
      <br />
      I tend to use 256x256 24-bit images though because they size in at about 192kb (256x256x3=196608) and compress quite nicely, sometimes down to 20-30kb in a zip file.<br />
      <br />
      I still think that the VU meter would look really cool if attached to a big spinning 3d speaker or stereo.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yea guys, sure I tried with small pictures. They look ugly when streched. I use AVS with 800x800 windowed and 1024x768 fullscreen.<br />

      I'll rework picture for smallest size. But dont' expect too realistic look.</p>

      <p class="post-content">800x800 windowed??? What kind of computer do you have a Sun box, or a Semiconductor Alpha? Maybe a Cray YMP could could get a reasonable framerate out of that. :P<br />
      <br />
      Is it pixel doubled? If so I take back the above and I'll assume you have a normal computer, in which case I'd say that 1024x768 pixel doubled is a good res, but I prefer 800x600 doubled. I think that everyone designs presets to run in low res like 320x200 or 400x300 because they are the most commonly used resolutions. To my knowledge very few people use pixel doubled windows and instead use small windows, I think that this is probably changing due to the very bad idea of having pixel doubling on by default with winamp 3 avs.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to upload the picture here to show off how nice it looks in high res then you could always make it into a jpeg and then we could save them to bitmaps ourselves. A realistic looking VU would be a good preset and a good inclusion for a pack, even if it needs a 400x400 picture. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Athlon XP 1600+ running on normal speed. :-) Of course pixels are doubled cause I set 1600x1200 in normal text mode on my 17". Small windows are too small for me. Without doubling it is tooooh slow.<br />
      <br />
      Ok then... Here first release of Classic VU-meter included. At final release I will include background with higher resolution. Of course I already made it and use on my computer. Heck... I think about ability to run _several_ AVS windows on same machine... Probably will add this to wishlist.<br />
      <br />
      Please look at Misc\Comment section of preset code.</p>
