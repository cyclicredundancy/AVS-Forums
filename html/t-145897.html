      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D X-Wing And Tie Fighters (Star Wars)</strong><br />
      This is new version of 3D X-Wing Fighter (Star Wars)<br />
      <br />
      This is simpler and should make it easier to appreciate the X-Wing in all its glory<br />
      <br />
      Changes:<br />
      replaced the background with more tie fighters<br />
      turned off subtractive2<br />
      made the colours brighter (slightly. Dark is good)<br />
      <br />
      Explosions occur after 16 beats and then start reversing after 4 more beats<br />
      The count is set back to zero after 32 beats<br />
      <br />
      Please allow some time for tie fighters to come close to the "camera"<br />
      <br />
      Why didn't Darth Vader ever think of synchronised flying?<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>Kind of like in the original trilogy before they made the Special Edition. :) You could see through ships during some scenes. Like in The Empire Strikes Back, when the transport ship is launched from Hoth, an X-Wing comes up and flys in front of it, and you can see through the X-Wing. :) This is on the original ones, I think they fixed that in the Special Edition.

      </blockquote>I know what you mean. Its a bit of an added difficulty in any 3d rendering - to either draw in the right order or hide lines<br />
      <br />
      I guess that's why I liked subtractive2 - it all became a bit "undeterminate" as to what what where - leaving the shading to help out the eye. Making the line thickness = 1 means a lot less problem with things in the "background" drawing over things in the foreground, but I liked it better with fat lines.<br />
      <br />
      There are infact 2 ways of seeing this object - at any time its eiher pointing towards you or away from you. Only the shading and minor perspective effects help out here. Without the shading - sometimes the XWing looks as if its getting smaller as it gets closer - until you realize that you looking at the situation backwards.<br />
      <br />
      I look forward to coming up with something new in 3D now

      <p class="post-content">The easiest way to make something look 'solid' is to use maximum blending and to make the points of the model darker the further away from the camera they are, since the foremost points are the brightest they will always be drawn over the darker points in the distance.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Maximum Blend</strong><br />
      Thanks Jheriko<br />
      <br />
      Well, Maximum Blend sure fixed that problem (hidden lines)!<br />
      <br />
      This version is the same as the last, but using Maximum Blend</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>3D X-Wing with Dynamic Movement</strong><br />
      The X-Wing is on Fire!<br />
      <br />
      This version's claim to fame is a cool backdrop, using a dynmamic movement<br />
      <br />
      Now the X-Wing is flying through a world made up of a floor and a ceiling<br />
      <br />
      I managed to get rotation eddies from 3D reflections and rotations<br />
      It has a lot of variation<br />
      <br />
      I think its pretty good</p>
