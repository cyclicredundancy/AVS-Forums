      <p class="post-content">you've got the movement down good but you need to sort out the part that displays the sides, its really broken so it makes those lines. The rest is good but that needs fixing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">the nice thing is that its a round tunnel so you dont have those ugly edges that you would get with a square one.Im working on it right now but try it with another texture and you`ll see it goes great.</p>

      <br />
      the tunnel's a bit wide, and the texture isn't showing up right (obviously). i blame it on the fact that it's not a real tunnel (judging by the code)...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well it's a tunnel preset... can't make them myself, but i think they are a bit overdone and you seriously need either a good idea, or a kick ass texture to make a good tunnel preset nowadays. This isn't that great, not bad, but not great either.</p>

      here's a fixed version of the dm, altho it looks dreadful. it doesnt even seem to be a tunnel. i also included a correct tunnel with it.<br />
      just look for the effect list after the dm and replace the dm with the dm in the effect list</p>

      <br />
      thats a nice DM phaze, i wouldnt say better than anything ive done :p cause its not finished yet. The texture is fucked up. the whole lines thing and whatevers alpha blended if there was nothing between the DM and the buffer save flashes across the screen ocasionally, excellent work now just finish it up and work on textures, you can have all the coding knowledge in the world but if you dont know how to make a good texture then its all worth nothing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">here ya go, there's REAL raytraced DM for tunnel.<br />
      Im just trying to figure the raytracing out and made the tunnel but i couldnt make it to move( <font color="red">*hint* *hint*</font>) to one direction AND i thing that there is something wrong with the solved k ( i guess that *k=sqrt(k1*k2)* is uncorrect) maping *chould* be correct.<br />
      <br />
      btw replacing the *k=sqrt(k1*k2* with *k=sqrt(sqr(k1)+sqr(k2))* gives nice tunnel thing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">you can load a texture and alpha-blend it to show only the alphabets, then use this as a texture for a tunnel dm.<br />
      <br />
      and Phaze, I think the tunnel dm is done before, because I saw something like that before, altho I dont remember where..<br />
      <br />
      and this is the third time I am editing this message...download my second pack, there you will find a rectangular tunnel which is quite simple to understand</p>
