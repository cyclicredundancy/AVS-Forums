question/request</strong><br>Hi,<br><br>I tried searching, and was coming up with zip, and a lot of .zip, but no answers:(.<br><br>If there was a forum for beginners where a few kind hearted, experienced coders would generously come in and check the posts from time to time, I would be posting this there. There isn't one, so I'm posting here. I must apologize ahead of time for how stupid my questions are, but I'm a beginner. I'm sure I'll get lots of answers that only bother to call me a n00b with n00b questions. Hee, tell me something I don't know:).<br><br>First of all if the answers have allready been given, a link would be greatly appreciated, I must be searching all wrong. Secondly I know you all are really busy, so I'm willing to wait patiently for replies.<br><br>Question 1: Is there a tutorial out there which explains how to make simple shapes? For instance when I open the avs editor one of the renders available has stars(nifty but I want to make different shapes:)).<br><br>Question 2: These questions should be in opposite order(I just realized), is there a tutorial for how to draw a line? I figured out how to make a line go across the screen by alterring one of the provided movements, might have been dynamic movement. So I realize it sounds like an awesomely moronic question.<br><br>I'm trying to make shapes which I could then move around the screen along x or y, even d or r(it's tricky to get the hang of, because I'm used to x, y, and z being parameters in 3d modelling and animation software, I'm almost positive it doesn't work the same in avs, which is why I'm asking here). I'm trying to keep from letting my pre-conceived ideas of how things should work from creeping into what I'm doing in avs.<br><br>On the bright side, I'm normally painting in Corel's Painter, or modelling and animating inside of either 3ds max or 3d anim8or. In fact 3d anim8or is an open source freeware application and they provide source code and tips for implementing it inside of other applications(like if you made a game and wanted to use 3d models and animations from anim8or, then you could, without tons of litigation about intellectual property). So that means, basically that while I understand almost nothing about avs, I understand things like color theory and perspective.<br><br>For example when using perspective, things appear to get smaller as they are farther away, and closer to the horizon. If we add color theory to the mix, cool colors(blue is an example of a cool color) recede, while warm colors(red and yellow are examples of warm colors) come forward, almost projecting themselves.<br><br>So you see, though I can't write much in the way of code(yet), once I understand how to code, I won't be mashing colors together that aren't complimentary to one another, or trying to force impossible perspectives. I tell you all this so that you can understand and see that I am serious, but also that it will take me some time to learn.<br><br><br><br>After all that, I'm sure you'll all be very relieved to see I'm not asking any questions about 3d(I don't think I am anyway). The reason is simple, imho you can't make a sphere without first knowing how to make a circle, and you can't make a box without first knowing how to make a rectangle(rememberring back in 7th grade geometry, how all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares).<br><br>I think once I understand how to make basic shapes and designs, it will be relatively easy to figure out how to implement the illusions that make them appear to be 3 dimensional or move within 3 dimensional space.<br><br>So basically I'm asking for help taking my first baby steps of making things. I have made some seriously ugly crap so far, so ugly that no, I won't share it, because I don't want to intentionally inflict pain on others. If they hurt my eyes, I know they'll hurt yours.<br><br>I'm coming at this from a non-coder's perspective(I'm learning how to code, but it takes time to learn, so I'm reminding myself to be patient). I have the box source from the sdk open in visual c++ and I'm copying it while studying a beginners' c++ tutorial I found in a websearch. Slowly I'm starting to understand what does what. Unfortunately the tutorial in the sdk looks to me like it's geared towards experienced coders and programmers. That's cool and all, since nobody probably figured on inexperienced folks such as myself even attempting to make anything.<br><br>What I need, is something similair, though not nearly as huge as that tutorial. Basically something that breaks it down with the // being before, not so much comments as instructions. So it would say something like // this does [insert what exactly the code does here] and then the following line(s) of code would do just that, really simplistically written so that even a baby could understand. Since when it comes to coding that's exactly what I am, a baby. However, I am positive I'm not the only baby out here.<br><br>Enormously grateful, I offer thanks in advance.<br><br>Thankyou,<br><br>Nolita *bracing myself for the towering inferno yet to come*</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th November 2004 10:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">First, Welcome to the wide world of AVS!<br><br>Second, are you definitively sure that you searched the forums for "tutorial" or some tantamount words? If so you surely made something wrong, cause there are many out there. I could give you tons of links etc (actually not tons but at least some ;) ) but you will surely find some (not all!) them on your own. Perhaps you should read some more threads around here before. Besides the "sticky" ones (very informative!), i saw a thread on the mainpage that was titled "Teach me". Though the author asked for 3D explanations he got many replies concerning general tutorials, explanations.. (and some more "noob-flames"! :mad: ).<br>Try again and be aware: there are many noob-flamers around. Oh, to late they're coming... Hurry up!:eek:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nolita</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th November 2004 11:42 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thank You,<br><br>I must surely have enterred the wrong search terms. Off to search again. Hey, they can flame away if they want to. It's okay. Heck I've seen some pretty hilarious flames so far. It's probably an initiation of sorts, instead of hazing, on the net we get flaming.<br><br>I saw the "Teach Me" thread, but didn't read the whole thing since I thought it was going to be nothing but a bunch of folks beating up on the guy. I'm going to give it another looksee, and see if I can't find the tutorials of which you speak.

There's not, so I'm back again, and so soon too:). Thankyou, ^..^(hope I spelled your handle right). When I was actually botherring to read beyond the flames in the teach me thread, I found the link to Pak-9's guide. I'm in the middle of using it. It's amazingly good. Couldn't resist skipping down a bit and looked at the 3d section, turns out I'm not nuts thinking in terms of x,y, and z coordinates:) Apparently I'm not the idiot I thought I was.<br><br>I noticed more replies when I came back to search for more tutorials. No I don't have Pak-9's entire guide commited to memory allready, but it is getting easier to remember stuff allready. I couldn't resist fiddling around a bit, and replaced a y with an r, put it over the blue hills.jpeg included with windows xp(just saved as a .bmp), made what looked like a rippling water reflection. It would be lousy as a preset, and I know a much better way of making a desktop wallpaper with rippling water, so it's just an "ooh you can do that!" thing for now. This learning stuff is very addictive, should come with a warning label.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th November 2004 15:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Pleased that you like it.<br>Have fun with it and good luck! :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Mr_Nudge</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th November 2004 01:53 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Question 1: Is there a tutorial out there which explains how to make simple shapes?

Still it may take you back to the day when you first saw Winamp and realized, hey yeah, I can do this. It's not the greatest but it's fun, good for your wtf? folder. As in Why the F_ck did I download this piece of crap?(hopefully it's not pure crap though, I mean I didn't grow the ingredients myself, but I did choose them carefully).<br><br>I think the important thing is, I had fun making it. It doesn't matter if it's not the most original preset ever, or if it's not perfect, or I didn't hand code all or even any of it, so long as I had fun, right? That's really saying alot since I'm bogged down with the flu right now. I had fun while coughing, sneezing, and hacking up, what I hope aren't any vital organs, and with a fever too.
