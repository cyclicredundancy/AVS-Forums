      <p class="post-content">Where do I begin?<br />
      <br />
      The very first Effect List has "Clear Every Frame" turned on, and then begins with an additive Buffer Restore. Under most circumstances, that would be a waste, since you can set the Buffer Restore mode to "Replace" instead, then you won't need the "Clear Every Frame" since it won't have any effect.<br />
      <br />
      All that is moot, though, because of something even more stupid: You never save a "Buffer 2" to be restored there. So forget all that and just delete your Buffer Restore. Later, you do the same thing with "Buffer 1". You're not saving anything anywhere, so using a "Restore" is just stupid.<br />
      <br />
      Setting an "Output blending" mode in an Effect List to "Buffer" does <b>not</b> save the output of that list to a buffer. Instead, it uses that buffer as an "Alpha map" to blend the output with the current image. If you don't save anything to these buffers, therefore, there is no output from these Effect Lists.<br />
      <br />
      Removing these useless Effect Lists (and their contents) doubled my FPS and halved the size of the preset.<br />
      <br />
      In the one remaining Dynamic Movement, you have code that reads: "r=t+tb/t+r+d/t-d/t;" ...Why are you adding d/t and then subtracting it again? "r=t+tb/t+r;" is much simpler.<br />
      <br />
      Of course, there are ways to further optimize this preset, but I think I got the main biggies.<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content"><font face="courier">By using 'reg' functionality, you are allows to load and save variables by generating a block of code which sets them, when loaded this block of code is executed. The code is easily readable and can be hand edited, you may declare variables and such, but they won't be maintaned after load or passed on into the main code.<br />
      <br />
      You also can create a master code using the 'reg' functionality. It can be set in numerical ranges (reg00 ---&gt; reg99).</font></p>

      <p class="post-content">:confused: errr... JaVS? what did you just say? It's a 'little' confusing.<br />
      Any way the 2nd paragraph says it quite right, although a bit complicated.<br />
      <br />
      Nuff said:<br />
      reg's are normal variables. The difference is, that they can be used anywhwere in any codeable component. They are indexed [as stated above] from 00 to 99. So you would define reg's just like any other variable:<br />
      <br />
      reg01 = sin(blabla*20)*.5+.5;<br />
      <br />
      Loading is just as simple as other variables:<br />
      <br />
      x = reg01+reg35*reg36;<br />
      <br />
      where the first line could be in one SSC in the beginning, and the other line in your final blow-away-Dynamov!<br />
      <br />
      You'd usually use reg's to calculate things you want to use several times throughout you preset for speed reasons. Also it's good for synchronizing things, like e.g. 3D SSCs.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Let me see if I can make it even more clear...<br />
      <br />
      The reg## variables, such as reg00 and reg99, work like regular variables, except they're shared globally. You can set a reg## variable anywhere, and then access that value anywhere else, even in a different preset!<br />
      <br />
      They're mostly used for synchronization.<br />
      <br />
      It is also possible to insert reg## variables into the text displayed by the Render / Text component.<br />
      <br />
      Another feature of reg## variables is that you can monitor their values with the AVS editor's "Debug Window". This can come in useful if you ever have to debug your AVS code.<br />
      <br />
      There. I hope that was helpful.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Me? Social skills. Bah. I think everyone who frequents this forum could probably do with some better social skills, half of you are barely able to communicate properly in the first place... :p<br />
      <br />
      I will be hard on anyone who comes along posting stupid questions because they deserve it. Every stupid question asked and answered leaves a stupid guy with some knowledge he didnt earn or deserve, which gives them less incentive to learn... which makes the global problem worse.<br />
      <br />
      If anything fastingaciu needs to learn social skills, his attitude of 'i expect help' is pretty unaccetpable socially.<br />
      its just a lot less nerve racking or embarassing when you ask stupid questions online than to a real person in person... so no lesson is ever learned by humilation or embarassment.<br />
      <br />
      people who only ever ask for help and learn nothing for themselves are annoying. they are MORE annoying in the real world. personally if I was a moderator here (thank god i am not) i would ban people like this after the third or fourth stupid question... they need to learn their lessons somehow.<br />

      Anyway, it's only natural for there to be people out there who don't know how to find the information they want. Yes, it would be nice if everyone with questions knew how to use the search function effectively, and the search function led them to all the answers they wanted. Unfortunately, not everyone is that smart... at first. And not all the possible questions have been asked.<br />
      <br />
      If we get the less-smart people pointed in the right direction, however; if we answer their questions, and also show them how to find the answers we have given others in the past (the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank">infamous search function</a> probably could stand to be more visible, by the way); once they start learning, and start figuring things out, who's to say what astounding things they could possibly come up with in the future?<br />

      </blockquote>I love these quotes. Mainly because there are hundred like it, and they seem so fundamentally correct on the face of it. I hate trying to explain why these things are wrong (I am sure I will offend someone with what I say :P), but I will give it a crack anyway:<br />
      <br />
      ----<br />
      <br />
      Every man who can learn how to fish for himself is more survivable than those who can't. Whats more is that fishing can be 're-invented' logically in very few steps.<br />
      <br />
      People who are taught to fish then survive better because they have been taught to fish by others. Not because they have the intelligence to work out how to be fishing in the first place.<br />
      <br />
      The advantage offered by extra intelligence is lost, and the offspring of the men who are able to learn fishing for themselves, have no clear advantage over those who lack this ability. Since more intelligence generally costs more energy, these people instead have a disadvantage as they need to eat more then those without this ability.<br />
      <br />
      So in at least one area of competition the evolutionary pressure on humans is no longer causing a net average increase of intelligence in later generatons.<br />
      <br />
      ---<br />
      <br />
      For all your desires to explain stuff to this guy, did anyone tell him that HE can figure out what makes a preset slow or fast by trial and error? No? And yet you went on to explain concepts which are more complex...<br />
      <br />
      You must learn to crawl, before you learn to walk. The same should apply when teaching people..., or as a more topical question:<br />
      <br />
      How do you explain the evaluation of a logical set of instructions without first explaining the logic they employ?<br />
      <br />
      "Teach a man to fish, and he will fish and feed himself as long as he was taught adequately, and as long as conditions don't invalidate the fishing method.<br />
      <br />
      Teach a man to learn for himself then he will teach himself and others, possibly how to fish, but more importantly how to learn to solve any problems."

      <p class="post-content">I suppose the question now is: By helping him with his immediate problem, and explaining some of the things he needed explained, am I also encouraging him to delve deeper into the mysteries of AVS? If he understands some of the more advanced concepts I've explained here, will he be more inclined to experiment with the more basic features, and thus learn more on his own?<br />
      <br />
      Let's judge how much he's actually learning once he asks his next question.<br />

And its not like just underneath <b>that</b> there is a thread called <b>AVS Frequently Asked Questions</b> or anything.<br />

Nah, sure it's not going to work too! The point is, they are so lazy to read all the important stuffs.</p>
