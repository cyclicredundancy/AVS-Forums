      I was sure that this feature is implemented: Select the next preset (also randomly with possible randomly chosen transitions) whenever a new song starts.<br />
      I searched here but could not find how to enable it. (Just how to switch presets after n seconds).<br />
      I still believe it must be there somewhere since it is not in the wishlist.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the link.<br />
      I did search, but the thread does not include the keywords I was looking for. Believe me, I'd rather have found a quick answer to my problem instead of opening a new thread and wait a few days for the answer.<br />
      <font size="1">It seems to be popular to answer every question that was asked before with eyes-rolling and "you should have searched", while I'm confinced that most people did so and would prefer to find the answer in the fist way or the FAQ.</font><br />
      And if I've found the link, I would still have asked if it has been implemented, since the request is three years old.<br />
      So I propose to put it on the wishlist, could one of the admins please move this thread there? (I don't want to next dude flaming me for cross-posting :rolleyes: )</p>

      I checked avs playlister and lost expectation of my life. This program is unusable, horribly designed, and crashed two times in 15 minutes.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Why does it require a plugin?<br />
      AVS already knows when a new song starts, you can see this in the beat detection section: There you can choose how to detect the beats when a new song starts (adapt or learn new).<br />
      So the trigger ist there.<br />
      All what it needs is to connect it to the switch preset section.</p>

      APEs can (and do!) run while not added to a preset, too.<br />
      here is an example <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7800156" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/7800156</a> :)<br />

      But:<br />
      It seemed to work the first few minutes, but than there was a transition in the middle of a song. Than I rememebered you wanted the random preset change disabled (why?) so I did and from that time I never had a preset change again.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Nothing. Not even a "ding".<br />
      In classic/modern/detached/attached<br />
      with "Random" on/off,<br />
      with "randomly switch presets" off/on and 10/30/100/1000 seconds<br />

      At least my bloodpressure did not go up, so I assume the program does not do any harm.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Problem with sound was because I sent a WM_SYSKEYDOWN message to the avs window instead of WM_KEYDOWN followed by WM_KEYUP.<br />
      Titule I really don't know what's wrong with you. Can some more people give it a try ?<br />
      <br />
      edit:<br />
      <br />
      I'm just looking at the include files of the new SDK and I see:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre>
<code>#define IPC_SETVISWND 611 // param is hwnd, setting this allows you to receive ID_VIS_NEXT/PREVOUS/RANDOM/FS wm_commands<br />#define ID_VIS_NEXT                     40382<br />#define ID_VIS_PREV                     40383<br />#define ID_VIS_RANDOM                   40384<br />#define ID_VIS_FS                       40389<br />#define ID_VIS_CFG                      40390<br />#define ID_VIS_MENU                     40391<br /><br />#define IPC_GETVISWND 612 // returns the vis cmd handler hwnd<br />#define IPC_ISVISRUNNING 613<br />#define IPC_CB_VISRANDOM 628 // param is status of random</code>
</pre><br />
      <br />
      So I think I can code it a proper way than sending keydown/keyup messages to the avs window after retrieving his handle with FindWindow/FindWindowEx<br />
      Time to go to work now, I'll update it this evening.

      <p class="post-content">sorry can't really follow. Actually i have no idea about real coding things. However the plugin works fine for me, although i found another bug: it seems as if you cannot deactivate it permanently. Everytime i deactivate it and restart winamp it is activated again. Is it supposed to be this way or is it really a bug?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Seems you never give up? Good, I appreciate that, but, sorry to say that:<br />
      No.<br />
      The configuration window and the version number has changed. (nice work, though :))<br />
      But nothing else.<br />
      I think now that it never worked and the first transitions I observed were the random transitions every 10 secs.<br />
      I got so unsure that I even pressed the "next" button to see if there are ANY preset changes (it worked).<br />
      <br />
      How can I help? Maybe you implement to write debug-output to a file that I can send you?</p>

      <p class="post-content">as the name says it should change to a new preset whenever a new song starts or the current song restarts.<br />
      <br />
      neither do you have to set a specific kind of transitions nor does the number of presets matter. When i tested that plugin i tried all different transition settings and i couldn't find one that doesn't work.<br />
      Concerning the number of presets: i guess the plugin recognizes when a new song starts and then simply tells avs to do the same that happens when you press space. So i don't think that the plugin cares about the number of presets, otherwise random-preset-on-spacebar wouldn't work either! :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think i know what is the problem with Titule<br />
      It's the prioroty of plug-ins. I had the same problem, but then i unninstaled some plugins and it worked.<br />
      Titule where you have your list of plugins in General purpose window, on which place is it, the AVS presets cycler?<br />
      On one computer i have it on last and it works, but on the other i had it on first place (dind't work) so I uninstaled some plugins (Nulsoft modern skin support, Nulsoft Global hotkeys and another but I don't the name, and I can't tell you why I unninstaled this plugins,) So this solved my problem, that may be the same as Titules.<br />
      <br />
      But on the 3'rd comp i have this problem. when i start winamp i have an error and it says:<br />
      <br />
      This application has failed to start because MSVCR71.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.<br />
      <br />
      I have tried reinstalling winamp, tried the updated version of plugin,<br />
      tried to use winamop v5.08e, latest winamp version, and still the same :(</p>

      </blockquote>This is because I compiled it with visual studio 2003. Get this dll at <a href="http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71" target="_blank">http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dl....shtml?msvcr71</a> and put it in your windows\system32 folder, should fix the problem.<br />
