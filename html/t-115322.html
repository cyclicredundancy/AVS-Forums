      <p class="post-content">I'll just give some comments:<br />
      <br />
      Roto-relaxer: very nice flow and very nice pattern. Definitely relaxing... it's very colourful, yet it doesn't look too busy.<br />
      <br />
      Somwhere in time: great idea to use a static starfield + water as a trippy background, I thought it was a picture at first. However I don't like the source mapped movement: looks much better without (especially because of the two lines in it).<br />
      <br />
      Space pressure: don't really like it, it's not very responsive and/or animated<br />
      <br />
      Up and down: don't like the colours and the pattern, not very responsive either<br />
      <br />
      Powerball: flashy colours, nice to use water to hide the ugly edges, but again, not very responsive<br />
      <br />
      Horisont is near: nice idea, but I don't like the flashy green, sorry ;)<br />
      <br />
      Fractals: very hypnotising and nice patterns.. feels very dancy, but otherwise unresponsive<br />
      <br />
      Hypnotising: pretty and it seems to have depth at the edges. cool :)<br />
      <br />
      Relaxoid: too bright for my eyes, and pretty static/repeating<br />
      <br />
      Fire in da hall: not everyone has to do a fire effect... it's a bit boring :)<br />
      <br />
      Fantasy volcano: original use of the dotfountain, but not very interesting<br />
      <br />
      Silk carpet: not responsive at all<br />
      <br />
      Metaballs 2D: hah funny, but metaballs are getting a bit :). Nevertheless nice preset, though it seems the motion is quite repetitive<br />
      <br />
      Crazy existance: whoa, veeery colourful. the movement is not bad<br />
      <br />
      Cosmobyte: a bit boring<br />
      <br />
      Reactor: great movement... but it would look better with a different pattern<br />
      <br />
      Bobble diving: idem as reactor<br />
      <br />
      Outrageous: very aesthetic... looks fiery<br />
      <br />
      Freak tonnel: strange colour palette.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      All in all, these are really not bad. Your dynamic movements all look great. The only thing missing is responsiveness: I don't really feel the music. Now this doesn't mean that everything has to have a spectrum or oscilloscope in it (because usually this causes ugly epileptic and shaky movement), but you should try make it dance some more. Something that moves in a playful way with onbeat changes can be much better than just a scope with 'v' in it.<br />
      <br />
      Oh and don't worry about your English: few people here are native english speakers. Just hang around and you'll be sure to improve. I would avoid using internet-abbreviations like 'u' for 'you' or '2' for 'to/too' because they make you sound like an annoying 12-year old AOL-loser :).</p>
