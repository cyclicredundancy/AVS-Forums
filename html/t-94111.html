The best bet for this kind of rotation is a 3D projection. Just use the regular rotation formula:<br>a2=a1*sin(theta)+b1*cos(theta);<br>b2=a1*cos(theta)-b1*sin(theta);<br>(where a1 and b1 are the original coordinates along the a and b axes, and theta is the rotation angle in radians) upon the planes <b>perpendicular to the axes rotated</b>. This means that a rotation around the Z axis would be upon the X/Y plane. Then, at the end...umm...actually I don't want to mislead you in this matter, so I'll turn it over to UnConeD, since he 'taught' me how to do this (even though I don't do what he said to do - i just try to figure out how to squish the stuff and it goes blah...yeah).<br><br><br><br>OR...If you're rotating around the Z axis, it's pretty simple. Just use the rotation for the Z axis, as there doesn't need to be any translation:<br>t=t+0.01<br>----------<br>x1=x;<br>x=x*sin(t)+y*cos(t);<br>y=y*cos(t)-x1*sin(t);<br>OR...You could just rotate it in polar coordinates and translate between them. The rotation is pretty simple:<br>t=t+0.01<br>----------<br>r=r+t;<br>And these are the translations:<br>r=atan2(x,-y);<br>d=sqrt(x*x+y*y)/sqrt(2);<br>x=sin(r)*d*sqrt(2);<br>y=-cos(r)*d*sqrt(2);<br><br>Glad to...uh...help ;)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">22nd July 2002 22:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Tonic</strong><br>By the way Tonic.. back in the AVS business? :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tonic</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd July 2002 08:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">UnConeD.

But if you want from me to be less modest I can. I may write you little history of my AVS life. I create AVS since v0.20a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=190" target="_blank">link for AVS v0.20a</a> and this was before near 3 years if I remember well I made my first preset in November or December 1999. I release my first AVS pack in <a href="http://www.deskmod.com" target="_blank">www.deskmod.com</a> in January 2000 of course AVS in this days are not as this in this days. In this time there was still no AVS section in WINAMP.COM. So when in August 2000 I made my first AVS Album with 130 presets I submit it in WINDOW and FULLSCREEN section. Then I start to wait to see how WINAMP staff will review my firs Album and for my great surprise they opend new section called "AVS presets" and thay open it with my Album. After that I release 4 more Albums under "Tonic" nick and one under "Gazirana Voda" nick.

And speed is very slow. I attached two examples you may use them to produce better result. In this AVS I fix problems with Distortions that Altero mentions with using Movement for reducing size of rotating object with .9 of screen size. And jumping rotation forward in the moment before distortions so there is no position where distortions can apear:)</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tonic</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th July 2002 15:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I forgot attachment or it do not work for me.
