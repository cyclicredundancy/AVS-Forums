      <p class="post-content"><strong>I'm a beginner!</strong><br />
      Hello. This is the first time when I show some of my presets to someone else. I like them a lot but I don't know if somebody else likes them also.<br />
      <br />
      What I want to say is that ALL the presets are made entirely by me, and nothing is copied (though some of them look copied :)) I have included all my presets in the archive, maybe you could tell me if there is something interesting among them all.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Do you mind not putting your files into a .rar file, but in a .zip file instead? Not everybody is using winrar.<br />
      As AVS filesizes are small anyway, the better compression ratio doesn't matter much.<br />
      <br />
      Wow! you may be new, but these presets are *really* good for a first internet-release. Not beginner-like at all!<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps you could make a selection of the best of these presets (like 15 to 25 presets or so) and submit it on winamp.com or create a <a href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">www.deviantart.com</a> page to release it there, where a lot of people can review it. (I have one too)<br />
      Installers can be easily made with <a href="http://www.visbot.net/index.php?p=15" target="_blank">pimpbot</a><br />

      <p class="post-content">Wow! I didn't expect such a good reaction! Thanks.<br />
      <br />
      Of course I will make a selection of all that, because there is a lot o crap there. Personally I think that there are about 5 "commercial" presets.<br />
      <br />
      Here are the files in .zip format :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">If we look at the coding, it's no beginner stuff at all :)<br />
      But usually presets need a lot more than just one single superscope or a dm. Though i don't know if this is just your experiment folder or what, but if you do plan on releasing a pack then i recommend you try to get on a preset more than that one superscope ;)<br />
      <br />
      Nice stuff and welcome :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">SWEET JESUS! This is all <b>your</b> stuff? WOW!<br />
      This is some awesome work! I love the fractal ones and your 3D work is amazing! Great job!<br />
      My only critisizm is this:<br />
      Try not to have as many black backgrounds, throw in an invert at the end or a colour map, and they'll look even better! That and try to build-up your dynamic-movement skills. I'm really looking forward to a finished pack!<br />
      Great work!</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well... Tuggummi you are right! That <b>is</b> my experiments directory and I know that it is not yet as good as I would like. And I <b>will</b> work on it and when I think it's done I will release it.<br />
      <br />
      I am very very glad that there are at least some guys who don't think it's all crap. Nice forum and nice guys you have here!<br />
      <br />
      Here's an unreleast pack, for the lazy ones, who don't like to unzip and stuff. This is an installer version, but it does not contain all of my presets.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Very very nice for a first post. Creative coding, correct aspect ratio and everything ;). Some of the scopes remind of Jheriko's stuff.<br />
      <br />
      The sferas are very nice their simplicity.<br />
      <br />
      A couple of things:<br />
      <br />
      - You don't use any Texer 2's anywhere. Any particular reason? Texer 2 comes with Winamp5 and is much better than Texer 1: it renders directly, supports scaling &amp; blend modes, ...<br />
      <br />
      - When you make your presets onbeat responsive, make sure they start off similarly to what happens after a beat. Many of your 'cub' presets zoom in until the first beat.<br />
      <br />
      - A good effect needs good finishing. You should try playing more with colors &amp; composition. Just rotating over the spectrum gives rather boring presets (I know I did that a lot in my earlier stuff). Also try doing more than just onbeat response. Vary speeds based on overall volume, make some elements connected to different parts of the spectrum, etc. A good preset suits any kind of music.</p>

      <p class="post-content">The very simple motive why I'm not using the Texer2 is that I did most of theese presets before the Winamp 5 and I simply didn't have time to play with it.<br />
      <br />
      As for the colors and other I will do my best. And I will try to make the moves dependent on the overall sound level. Thank's for the idea :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">you'r coding is definitely very interesting and different<br />
      sign that you figured stuff out yourself, and didnt use others presets, very good.<br />
      <br />
      Very interesting how you'r doing the cube, quite nice idea, and fake bf culled sphere is nice too.<br />
      <br />
      Its always good to check others presets to see how they do something, and later use ideas you got.</p>
