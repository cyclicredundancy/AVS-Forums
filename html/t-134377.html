      <p class="post-content"><strong>Hello AVS world!!!</strong><br />
      Hello people...<br />
      <br />
      this is my first thread to this forum...<br />
      even if I knew long time ago, winamp had this AVS plugin ... it is about 4 days now i found out how cool and powerfull is. Actually I think it is one of the easiest way to create impresive and fast graphics. I spent the whole weekend doing stuff and here is what I managed to do...<br />
      <br />
      all 4 files are mainly maths/prog.<br />
      I want to say that for the 3ds I used ELVIS preset, which I modified it a bit and add my 3d sphere with some interesting colors. I am sure it can be optimised a lot but I found out that if you put an extra variable to any of the paremeters in sphere creation you can create tons of cool things like the one in abstract.avs<br />
      I am also really proud for the interpolation one :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok, sorry about the editing ;)<br />
      <br />
      Some nice superscopes here, i think it's ok to use the El-Vis 3D engine, but many others on these forums don't think so...<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, i think you are doing well with the coding part on the superscopes, but i think the some of the presets need trans effects as well...<br />
      <br />
      <u><b>Interpolation</b></u> - Nice scope, and nice color coding. Tho i think it's a lot better with less fadeout and some other trans effects wouldn't hurt here either. Maybe a bit too minimalistic preset.<br />
      <br />
      <u><b>Bacround</b></u> - Uhm... it seems you forgot to attach the picture in the zip file for this preset...<br />
      <br />
      <u><b>3DFireBall</b></u> - This is definetly nice, but i think it would be better without the grow/shrink lines... Making the number of lines static would result in a better preset in my opinion. Also needs trans effects... And btw. using an effect list with Replace/Replace does nothing, it only slows down the preset. Don't stack up the effects inside an effect list if you're not going for an effect by it.<br />
      <br />
      <u><b>3dAbstract</b></u> - Nice wavy shapes, but the same things bother this one as the 3DFireBall one. Including the unnecessary use of the effect list &amp; line thingy.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Good to see some new avsers around here, and some good stuff too :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not bad. You've got a pretty good start here. My comments are pretty much the same as Tuggummi's are. If you include a picture or AVI in a preset, you gotta include it in the zip bacause chances are we don't have that picutre in our AVS dir.<br />
      <br />
      The reason peple her eseem not to like the EL-Vis engine is that feel it lacks customizability, and is slow. I just think it's a good exercize to make your own, so you know how it ticks.</p>

      <p class="post-content">first of all thank you all for your comment...<br />
      <br />
      about the backround.avs... it is not anything particular.... if u just put any picture u want it would be ok... it only a dynamic movement.<br />
      ok I'll have to work out my self the matrices for all the rotation... but i believe i'll follow the same approach for it...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Nice presets but still too blank. u see u have to use other effects also to make good presets. and like others said try to create the ssc lines static.</p>

      oh just one small thing,no big deal, ishan and cg can you just take your time when posting and type "you" instead of "u", it's a forum so you don't need to post in record speed so just take your time. Nothing big just make an attempt. Thanks :)</p>
