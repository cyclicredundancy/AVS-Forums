After all, the AVS syntax is not too far away from Java/PHP/Perl/C. But then, to make the whole thing effective, you'll *need* to compile the script parts to bytecode, so they can be executed on demand<br>This alone needs in-depth knowledge of the Java VM.<br><br>Next, you'll need to know how all the standard effect components of AVS work (like blur, dynamic movement, etc.)<br><br>If you're then done with all that work (after maybe 5 years or so :) ), Nullsoft will probably have released several new versions of AVS, and your work goes on :)</div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div><table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="alt2"><hr>I know that the sandbox is there only if you run an unsigned applet... did you know that?
