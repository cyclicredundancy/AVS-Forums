When that title is playied, AVS will look for that textfile in a specified location. If the lyrics are timestamped, Avs will disply lines of lyrics based on Winamps Song-time. Now do you understand?<br><br>LyricsAMP is a long time gone. It is no longer in Winamps Plug-in section. I had LyricsAMP for a long time. It never did place lyrics in the avs.<br><br>I am not looking for lyrics. I dont want nor need a program to display lyrics. I need some sort of add-on to the AVS that will display time stamped lyrics so that I can create AVS Presets with the curent song lyrics in the background.<br>This type of API (I think thats what it is called) will alow for presets to better flow with songs. This type of specific input for specific songs would also pave the way for custom beats, colors and even different presets for different songs loaded automaticly.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">1st April 2004 17:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Lyrics on AVS?

If you use a normal playlist, you could create some sort of database that contains the lyrics and information about how long every line should remain shown on screen.<br>Then there is the issue of screen resoluton, just as in the Text renderer.<br>Creating the APE and databases can be done, but especially the database would be a LOT of work, just imagine: re-writing the lyrics for every song you have, plus the time every line lasts. I think that every song would take about an evening, multiply that wiht every song you have (1400+ in my case) and that's the time you'd need...<br>But yes, it could be done... :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">truedarkshadow</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd April 2004 16:27 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I was thinking about how long every line would remain.
