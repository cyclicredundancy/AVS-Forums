      <p class="post-content"><strong>Some information about the Virus</strong><br />
      Hi,<br />
      <br />
      i just read about this virus on an German board.<br />
      It seems to try to delete Files and it scans your "My Files" Folder and then sends itself with some files of your "My Files" Folder to anyone in your Adressbook AND to any E-Mail Adresses in your Browsers cache. And I think that is why the 5 star authors get the most Virus Mails, their E-Mail Adress is on so many pages that so many people load.And as it comes with its own "E-Mail Client" it is very difficult to stop it. You may delete your E-Mail Adresses from all the Webpages, but i think that´s too late.<br />
      Hope nobody opened the attachments.<br />

      <p class="post-content">I got Sircam, and I can tell you what it does. 1) It is a virus that is in your recycled folder (C:\recycled\SCam32.exe is the file). The SirCam Virus has it's own SMTP mail server (outgoing mail). It then sends ANY file from your My Documents Folder to EVERYONE IN YOU ADDRESS BOOK. How Fun. Expunging it is much harder than sending an e-mail with it.<br />
      It is known as the "Friendly" Virus because it has the first line:<br />
      "Hi! How are you?"<br />
      and the last line:<br />
      "Thanks"<br />
      It originated in Mexico and that is why it is in Spanish.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Well, Virus makers are what help the anti-virus software creators create much better software. Heck, even old virus makers and developers are now anti-virus software manufacturers. AND the old virus makers are developing new virii for companies like Symantec so they have a piece of software that can stop ALL upcoming virii and could possibly download an update with out you knowing, so that you could be protected.<br />
