      <p class="post-content"><strong>Dedications</strong><br />
      I had this idea recently and I cant decide if its a good idea or a real stinker. I was thinking about how there's quite a lot of :up:self appreciation:up: in the AVS community... now dont get me wrong, AVS only has a small community so it needs that to a certain extent . Then I got to thinking about dedications, presets people make to honor other artists that have inspired them in some way, its a nice gesture...<br />
      <br />
      Then I though, wouldnt it be interesting to have a 'dedications pack', where people make a couple of AVS presets dedicated to artists who have inspired them or been in some way influential. Obviously some people would get a lot of dedications, but it would still be fun, people could make presets in the style of people they are dedicating to, and include a comment about how they have been helpful.<br />
      <br />
      There are already loads of dedication presets out there, probably enough to make a pack out of :D Anyway, its just an idea, comments?</p>

I used a heavily modded El-Vis scope in my 3d Scope 3 preset from my 4th pack... Does that count as a tribute preset ? :rolleyes: :rolleyes: :p :D :D :D :D :D.<br />
      <br />
      Shame I saw this thread just now, I would've done Nixa and Stardust tribute presets (and 2 more for someone I would think of)... not kidding there, kinda feel like making presets again. Unfortunately?, I'm going to Spain next week, and have no time.</p>

        <br />
        Also, where does everyone think I should release it... Wherever I put it (devart, wa.com) it will be under my name which is a bit naff. Plus whenever I submit stuff to wa.com something goes horribly wrong.... just try searching for my packs :rolleyes:</p>

        <p class="post-content">Yes, well, sometimes avs+visualisations doesn't work.... so I usually change both categorys to, and than it always works. If you selected just the primary, maybe the reviewer added the secondary. Or maybe you're just lucky.</p>

        <br />
        though i must admit, that i don't like the presets, i think you have some responsibility as a representive of nullsoft (you might not be employed, but still you do a job for them). you are discouraging people and are too subjective in your critic (i.e. "unremarkable", "boring", "ugly"). imagine that these people might use winamp just because of the plugins (like me for instance!), discouraging them the way you do, these people might look out for another player - and that certainly is not in the sense of nullsoft.</p>

        although "unremarkable", "boring" and "ugly" could be construed as subjective they give people an idea of what to expect in a pack. Presonally I'd prefer subjectivism to an elaborate objective description of the pack in abstract and vague terms which frankly is the only alternative. If every pack is just described, it makes it hard to know if you will really like them. Just my opinion.</p>

        <p class="post-content">Think of it this way... I get loads of single presets submitted here, and packs with bad installers. I used to write in every single review that they should make a pack instead, and that they should at least make the installers with proper paths and everything. And still, I get more, and often from the same "authors". You'd think they would get the point....<br />
        <br />
        I agree, those reviews might have been discouraging. But maybe they encouraged that person to try harder - to make presets that the staff won't think of as ugly or boring. It really depends on the individual. Maybe if I used abstract and vague terms (and I definitely could), the author won't understand me, especially if he/she is a newbie to avs. Or simply doesn't know english that well. I think everyone understands "boring" and "ugly".<br />
        <br />
        I could write far more, but I'm too tired now.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        And please.... that italian guy gave his preset a 5.</p>
