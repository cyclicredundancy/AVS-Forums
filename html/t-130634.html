      <p class="post-content"><strong>Erm, Atero? | XOR Blending</strong><br />
      As i said i was working through your Primer in order to get some more knowledge on 3d stuff. Well i figured out that something was missing.<br />
      <br /></p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>Originally written by Atero</i> <b><br />
        Minimum Blend<br />
        Uses the least amount of color between the two frames. I can't<br />
        remember where this is used, but it's not usable in effect lists.<br /></b>
      </blockquote>Its used in UnConeD's APE's (Picture RendererII and Corlor Map). I'd advise you to either leave this out, or to explain those APE's too.<br />
      <br />

      <blockquote>
        <i>Originally written by Atero</i> <b><br />
        XOR<br />
        Don't know anything about what this is, but it's trippy.<br /></b>
      </blockquote>To understand XOR generally we need to know that eXclusiveOR means nothing else than a boolean or - but excluding the and.<br />
      <br />
      The programming code woud be: x xor y = (x or y) and not (x and y)<br />
      <br />
      And here is a tabe to make this more obvious:<br />
      <font face="courier new"><br />
      x|y|result<br />
      -+-+------<br />
      0|0|0<br />
      0|1|1<br />
      1|0|1<br />
      1|1|0]</font><br />
      <br />
      As we know, the color channels are calculated seperately.<br />
      <br />
      Now we imagine x and y to be the two red-channel values.<br />
      <br />
      First, AVS converts them too boolean values which means dividing by 255 and rounding up or down.<br />
      <br />
      That means a color value of 128-255 is 1, a color value of 0-127 is 0.<br />
      <br />
      Then, AVS does XOR, as explained before.<br />
      Finally we need to get a useable color value as a result which means multiplying the result with 255.<br />
      <br />
      To put it in a nutshell, a value above 127 and a value below 128 will result in a full valued color channel with 255, if the values are both above 127 or below 128 this will result in color channel of 0.<br />
      <br />
      Well, i could also have pm'ed this but if Atero did'nt know about XOR there are probably more around who don't either.

      <p class="post-content">Erhm... You know there is a thread about the primer uptade already at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=121697" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread....hreadid=121697</a> Also you could've just PM atero , why make a new thread about it?</p>

      </blockquote>Ok, seems i to sorta missed the primer update thread.<br />
      <br />
      But anyway, this is not just about updating the Primer, but mainly about XOR Blending (renamed the Topic) and this way the 2-3 months old thread wont be revived.<br />
      <br />
      /Edit<br />
      And this way there may be more newbies profiting from it because they wont have to work themselves through 50 posts first. Anyway i dont think it would'nt kill anyone to have a new thread

      </blockquote>I think you as a regular already know what old threads are appropriate to be revived and what not, like take example the Tips&amp;Tricks (which eventually was made into a sticky one)<br />
      <br />
      But anyway... actually i have nothing to say anymore :p

      <p class="post-content">I don't think that that is how AVS does XOR, because then XOR would only result in a couple of colors being used, not the entire range that it does use.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I just checked that, seems you're right<br />
      <br />
      I found this out by testing it with large text letters in many color constallations and in most cases this rule works. Maybe it processes some color constellations in a diffrent way.</p>
