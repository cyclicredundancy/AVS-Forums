      <p class="post-content">You can't, unless you want to edit the preset so that it uses globvars.ape<br />

      but you wont<br />

      You'll want to use TomyLobo's <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/12811411/" target="_blank">eeltrans</a> too, as it may very well save you two months of work.<br />

      Bottomline: It'd be easier to make pigs fly, but, yes, it's possible (but you seriously don't want to).<br />
      <br />
      Suggestion: Start experimentating with creating presets from scratch. You can get ideas/inspiration by looking into other presets (give credit where credit's due!)<br />

      <p class="post-content">Thanks for the info. I'll be sure to read it. Yea i'd really like to try this. I'd definately be sure to post here if i make any progress. I work alot so it looks like weekends might be my only chance to work on it. But thats alright if i can get somewhere on it lol.<br />
      <br />
      Another question i have is, where can i find some more Dancing Girl AVS Plugins? I downloaded that one from here and i really like it. But i was wondering if there were anymore out there.</p>

      <p class="post-content">To be honest it wouldnt necessarily be /that/ hard, you could just dump the entire contents of the gmegabuf and every register to file; thats assuming the preset doesnt use the local megabufs a lot (which it might, I haven't checked). However globvars is a bit flakey so you wouldnt get an especially stable result.</p>

      </blockquote>There are no good ones that I know of; the closest AVS preset would be UnConeD's "Mr Happy" (from Whacko V)<br />
      <br />
      Are you sure you're talking about AVS and not some wildtangent adwaremagnet?<br />
      <br />
      But whatever. If you can find out how to optimize Architectural Design like you plan to, then making a realistic dancing girl would be a piece of cake.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Hey, let me be honest with you.<br />
      <br />
      I don't believe that anyone of us is motivated to help you since you're just new with AVS, plus that this task is uninterresting*) and bigger than anyone of us has ever done before (we're willing to help, not to do it for you).<br />
      <br />
      *) The only reason that we don't say that it is impossible is because in <b>pure theory</b> it could be done.<br />
      But realistically noone is stupid enough to do it. It's like building a working airplane with just empty soda cans. Plus that noone would want the plane when it's finished.<br />
      There are better things to do for us, plus that Architectural Design has very little to do with what AVS is really about: Visualizing music. In fact, AD is a very bad example of an AVS preset.<br />
      If you want a good list of presets, I recommend you get <a href="http://www.visbot.net/cat/VB100.zip" target="_blank">visbot 100</a> for you. :up:

      <p class="post-content">I just did a quick hack of AD to enable saving and loading of the construction. To open it just put "globmgr.ape" in the avs folder, and the other file in any subfolder of the avs folder.<br />
      To save: double tab n.<br />
      To load: double tab m.<br />
      <br />
      It's just a quick hack that dumps the contents of the regs and of the gmegabuf 0-100000, thus saving can be rather slow. At first I considered changing the format of the builing, because it's currently quite ineffective, but because it's such a big avs file I really couldn't be bothered with it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">@ThePimp yes it will allow saving. The building will be save to a file called AD4U.gvm. It can't save more than one building though, so if you want to store more than one, you will have to make some copy/pasting of that file yourself.</p>
