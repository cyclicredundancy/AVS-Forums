To quote the FAQ:<br><br><i>If you are a beginning artist, it's best to post your work in the AVS Presets forum as a regular zipped package first. The people there are also AVS artists and can give you useful tips on how to improve your presets.</i><br><br>First of all, I see no point in showing off the amount of presets... except in rare cases (like desibel+), large packs suffer from low quality. Throwing out the less-than-good presets will raise the quality of your pack.<br><br>Your installer is indeed pretty crappy and illegal on top. You extract the APEs in a subdir, which will not work, and you're using old versions to boot. Use the latest colormap/convolution/texer from Winamp5 (or the latest Pimpbot).<br><br>Yathosho is right about the clm files (I wrote colormap.Ape, so I should know): the CLM files are just for storing and copying maps, and are not required for the preset.<br><br>As far as the presets go: the only ones that seemed somewhat interesting were the Nighthawk ones, where at least some effort went into aesthetics and colors. But even those needed a lot of work to be good. Most of the presets are either simplistic, overly slow, or both.<br><br>Finally, there's a bunch of ripping going on: the DM in Photonic NRG is by skupers, and this isn't mentioned anywhere. Back in the Box is an el-vis remix. New Galaxy is a remix of an old newpicks preset (I think katmandu-commercial). I didn't dissect every preset, but I'm sure there are more. Roma seems to be the only one giving some credit, but I doubt you asked skupers for permission if the others are rips.<br>I'm amazed that if you say you've been skinning for so long that you still don't respect other's work.<br><br>Here are a couple of my favourite AVS packs that you should check out:<br><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/2512760/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/view/2512760/</a><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/1776153/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/view/1776153/</a><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/2194656/" target="_blank">http://www.deviantart.com/view/2194656/</a><br>And mostly anything at:<br><a href="http://visbot.net/index.php?title=RELEASES" target="_blank">http://visbot.net/index.php?title=RELEASES</a><br><br>If/when this gets published at Winamp.com, it'll get removed because it is a definite rip, which is not allowed.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Skins</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2004 16:03 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">all of the ones that were remakes, were commented with the original comment and the author (unless they were done by my friend, im not sure what he did exactly)<br><br>ok, im going to work on the presets some more before i re-post this, i pulled the submission from winamp, imand im going to do the samew with my pack on my site......that still dosnt help me with pimp bot though.....<br><br>Im going to go through them now, and ill )hopefully) put the new Zip file up....</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Skins</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2004 19:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ok, here is the updated "Leagal" version of it (zip)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fragmer</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">2nd January 2004 23:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Optimizing tips</strong><br>This is getting better. But why did you remove "Cubex - Anarchy Smoke Fire"? It was one of the best presets :)<br>You still have a lot to learn, ripping is normal for beginners, it's part of learning.<br>Here are some speed-up tips:<br>- Instead of using 4 fadeouts with low velocity, use one with higher velocity.<br><br>- Set lower grid size in simple DMs, for example if you're uning DM for simple shifting or zooming, why calculate same thing 16*16=256 times?<br><br>- In DMs/SuperScopes don't calculate on Point/Pixel things that don't change. For example: You have SSC and per-point you have "r=i*2*$PI". But "$PI*2" never changes, you can calculate in on Inizialization of the preset. Or if you have variable "t" in SuperScope, every frame you add some number to it: "t=t+0.05" and on point you use the sine of it: "x=sin(t)". For example you have 800 points. So your CPU does 800 same calculations every frame! Calsulate sine of "t" every frame instead: "t=t+.05; st=sin(t);" and on point use that value: "x=st;".<br><br>- Try making your own movements, like this:</p><pre>
<code>r=r+sin(d*$PI*5);</code>
</pre>...instead of 10 "swirling both ways at once" movements.<br><br>- Use faster APEs insted of slower analogs. For example: Convolution instead of Blur, Multiplier instead of (Fast-) Brightness and ColorMap instead of Unique Tone.<br><br>- Don't use THAT many effectlists, they don't realy do anything most of the time. I attached an example how it is possabile to optimize the preset by removing 90% of effectlists. Isn't it easier to edit like this?<br><br>BTW, UnConeD, do you recognise "The Core"?
