Still, it is clean and asthetically pleasing<br><br><i>The cave</i> - You NEVER, repeat NEVER need 6, count em, 6 dynamic movements one after the other. The effect is kinda cool but OMG what were you thinking! 6! I'm too appaled to go on...<br><br><i>Dragons flight</i> - The best preset in the pack, a cool effect, but it really needs to be synced with the ground. And the old 'totally superfluous DM' thing is creeping in again<br><br><i>Plant vision</i> - A nice effect, just a solid preset, but by this stage I was already sick of the replace mode texer2 effect.<br><br>Generally: Nice pack, could do with some optimisation and that 'sine wavey replace mode texer2' effect is quite overused.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Mr_Nudge</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th September 2004 10:29 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">WOW, this is your first pack?? This is really good work!<br>Your going places my friend :)<br>The tentacle is a little overused and try to get some brighter colours (there was an overall greyness to them), but apart from that great work! Keep it up.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Oshango</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th September 2004 21:45 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the great critique PAK-9. I was admittedly confused about integrating the different DMs. It occurred to me after your post though that I could translate the DMs that are using polar cooridinates into rectangular coordinates and thus be able to mesh some together. I still haven't figured out how to take a seperate alpha DM and movement DM and put them together without having to add a buffer save and clear screen, but I'll play with that and see if I can't get it to work.<br><br>I'm going to change the names of "Cave Intro" and "The Cave", to "Cave Part I", and "Cave Part II". Cave Intro isn't the intro to my next pack, but to the next preset after it, The Cave. I think changing the names and rewording my comment will make that clearer.<br><br>On the squareness of the cobra, I agree with you entirely, I would love to be able to make it a bit more round. On my Texer II wishlist I asked for the ability to load a separate bmp as an alpha mask. This would make it possible to make a cobra with a more elliptical body; not to mention all the other endless shapes that could be played with. Then you guys will really be sick of seeing my endless tendril permutations. :)<br><br>Again, thanks, I'll give your comments some more thought before making my executable. Yathosho's new posting of PimpBot 2.1 was very timely.<br><br>--<br><br>And Mr. Nudge, thank you also for checking out my pack. Color has always been difficult for me, finding that balance between muted elegance and colorful excitement. I'll keep working on it though.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
