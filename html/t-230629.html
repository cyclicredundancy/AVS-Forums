      <p class="post-content"><strong>triangle</strong><br />
      Just wondering to myself aloud why *some* presets with triangle won't show. Seems they are working alright, judging from the frame-rate counter in the editor, they just don't show (its black). This is with unmodified presets got here, and I have tried modifying everything that I *know* of (:) ) to make them visible. Don't think this is a h'ware or config problem, since most do work.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I recently had some similar trouble concerning a small number of presets that didn't show anything. The solution was to reinstall the "AVSTrans Automation" APE (included with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=229794" target="_blank">one of the packs</a> that had this problem), since I apparently had an older version that lacked one particular feature. (And it wasn't updated automatically like the other AVS components.)<br />
      <br />
      Can you give us some examples of presets that don't work?</p>

      <p class="post-content">some of this is also down to my global variables ape as well as eeltrans. the new eeltrans fixes my problems here... unfortunately i lost the source to global variable manager... so i cant fix the bugs in the loader. sorry guys...<br />

      <p class="post-content">If I'm recalling correctly, the affected presets with triangle did not include trans Automation. Also, no I cannot recall any specific preset, but I'll keep my eye out and post an example or two (maybe more). I have been deleting them, but I'll keep them in a separate dir from now on. Thanks.</p>

      </blockquote>Odd. That preset has always worked fine for me...<br />
      <br />
      Why rename it btw, coned might take offense :P

      <p class="post-content">It works for me as well. It's pretty cool, too.<br />
      <br />
      At this point, there's not much I can suggest... It might be a good idea to make sure you have the newest version of the triangle APE, in case there's an earlier version that can't handle that much code at once.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Hmmm, I'll try the triangle.ape angle and see what happens.<br />
      (so, what's it supposed to look like?) :)<br />
      <br />
      As for renaming, well I had NO intention of ever posting someone else's preset here, then this happened. For myself, i just wanted a collection of cool presets here for my own use, but found the naming conventions cumbersom, so what I have done is group them by the majour function within the preset, giving them names accordingly, that's all.<br />
      <br />
      Whenever I get ready and comfortable enough to post any myself (and that's a long way off) rest assured that I will not be infringing on anyone elses work.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks so much for helping.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Checked my copy of triangle.ape, and indeed it was the one from Nov., 2004, where I see the latest (?) was from Dec., 2004 (pls correct me and point me to the right place, if wrong). No joy.<br />
      <br />
      However, I did find that going from 32-bit colour to 24-bit did help *some* presets with triangle, but not all, and even then did not make them fully visible in most cases. Weird.<br />
      <br />
      So, I guess I'll continue to play with it and see what happens, and report any cures if they happen.<br />
      <br />
      Cool new pack, Tug.</p>

      here is the latest one.<br />
      <br />
      also, avs uses 32-bit rgb0 internally so the external color settings shouldnt really matter that much...</p>
