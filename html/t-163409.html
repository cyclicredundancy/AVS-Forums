      <p class="post-content"><strong>AVS 2 LED wall APE</strong><br />
      For long time i am using avs and every kind of great APE.<br />
      Now i need help in creating an ape that outputs the generetad video in realtime to a vb-application controling a LED-wall (about 200x160 triplepixels, rgb) .<br />
      i have seen that someone created a great grabberape but this usefull ape writes an avi. i hope someone has an idea about building an ape that can simulate a webcam :) (for the wdm reason).<br />
      Such kind of ape could be usefull to transmit/stream the avs-output over a lan to streamingclients (my client in this context is my LED-wall controller).</p>

      <p class="post-content">YEah I saw one used REALLY well at a massive attack concert. Don't know much about them though. Im pretty sure they take straight video data and the led wall has a converter built in. (I had a quick peek at the VJ rig -seemed like a simple flash mixer)... mrrll...</p>

      <p class="post-content">Um you might want to say what you need help /with/. The APE is SDK is available on NSDN (click tab above) &gt; WVS. Oh and remember that you will need to have your ape in every preset. You could hack this up through code I think, but I haven't tried it.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>ape in every avs</strong><br />
      &gt;unconed<br />
      i have seen that whit the hotlist application from magixx:) (great guy) a beat detection ape is added at runtime to every avs.<br />
      maybe it is possible to add a list of apes for dynamic insertion in hotlist. so i will play trough hotlist.<br />
      unconed, you are the developer of one of the grabber apes?, is this right?</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>the LED wall</strong><br />
      i have sold my LED wall to an italian Hockey stadion:) and i will build a new bigger ledwall with more powerfull LEDS and with more resolution. i think about 800 x 600 and 7 meters divided into segments of 1m x 1m .. the electronic isnt the problem.. the problem is to have a simple software interface without building a vga to matrixconverter. i wrote code to convert bitmaps and videos to output on the wall, but it isnt nothing realtime nor elegant.<br />
      it would be great to manage the stadions ledwall with avs and hotlist. imagine the effects playable on "goals" or on beatdetection:) very coool</p>

      <p class="post-content">I'm not sure how hotlist does it, probably by simulating button clicks and such.<br />
      <br />
      I'm curious about your led wall though ;). Any details on the operation? I'm curious how you'd address something like that, and what the refresh-rate and style is (switching only like an LCD or constant signaling like a CRT).</p>

      <p class="post-content">you would need a dual-proz. server for few thousand bucks to make complex AVS run fast at 800x600.<br />
      Also many presets actualy look ugly at high resolution because they were originaly designed for normal PC use.<br />
      You should have a lot of money and time (and brain of course) to make LED walls.<br />
      Sorry, I'm not good at C/C++ I wish I could help you...</p>
