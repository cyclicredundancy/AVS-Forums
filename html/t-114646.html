You have to use a lot smaller resolution like 320*240 which is believe it or not, a pretty high resolution for avs if you want it to run smooth.<br><br>With that kind of machine you should be able to view most of the presets around with a decent 25-40 framerate with that resolution, but yet it depends how complex the avs preset is.<br><br>And avs isn't only about beat detection, it is up to the avs preset how it visualizes music. Some presets are beat responsive and others react to sound, some visualize music with a scope or have patterns that react to sound/beat. It is all about what kind of preset you are viewing.<br><br>If you are still looking for high framerates, try a standalone visualization plugin/component rather than avs, but don't expect that there is as much variety than in avs.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">blazer1504</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th November 2002 16:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">If it has ABSOLUTELY no beatdetection, check 'advanced beat detection' from 'settings' ---&gt; 'beat detection'</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mikm</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">19th November 2002 00:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>also...</strong><br>Also remember that AVS is done in the processor, not your graphics card.

I've written some very optimized filters for AVS (Colormap for example). Each one contains a minimum amount of MMX instructions that processes whole pixels at a time (texer does 2 at a time because less processing is required). Processing this sort of stuff in software is SLOOOOOOOOW. And rewriting it for hardware is not as straightforward as you would think, because you have to rethink your entire model. Plus, only recently has it become possible to do your custom effects on the GPU using pixelshaders, and most people don't have a capable card for that.<br><br>So far, the only component of AVS which has been proven to be very inefficient is the scripting language (I've been poking around a disassembly of AVS, see the thread 'AVS Mysteries'). But then again, this was never meant to evaluate complicated stuff. For the rest, fast MMX code is used to processes entire pixels at a time as fast as the CPU (and more importantly the system RAM) can handle them.<br><br>I'm perfectly happy with 320x240, because AVS' visuals keep on being interesting. If you want fast visuals, try Milkdrop. It's also customizable to a certain degree and runs hardware accelerated.

People have been so bullshitted by marketing hype that they think they have become experts. You claim the end result of AVS is useless and a waste of time. Yet tons of people are enjoying AVS visualisations all around the world, even using them for projections at parties. And in my own experience, flashy visualisations like dancing 3D girls tend to capture people's attention for a couple of minutes, but put something like AVS on, and people will stare for hours and the endlessly varying and uniquely responsive visuals. I've seen it at parties, where the main audience is people who are complete outsiders to the visualisation scene. And that's even with 'low-resolution' AVS stuff!<br><br>On the other hand, if people think 320x240 or 400x300 is unacceptably low, then I won't try and change their opinion.<br>In fact, We KNOW that most of it is actually in the head and just pure non-sense:<br>we've had people here claiming that 'turning on pixel-doubling has improved everything because it allows them to run at higher resolutions'. If you don't know what pixel-doubling is, it's an option in AVS that resizes the image horizontally and vertically by 200% by making every point 2x2 pixels large, because older cards sometimes don't support resolutions below 640x480 at 32-bit.<br>So in fact, 800x600 pixel-doubled is the same as regular 400x300, and people *have* told us that the first looks better.<br><br>My take on the whole thing? I don't care. If someone says to you "You know, we put a guy on the moon nearly 35 years ago. And now we still don't have a lunar base or have visited Mars! That's rediculous!" how will you reply to that? Do you still feel the person shouldn't care about what was 'going on behind the scenes', about the political, social and economic events that lead to the space race in the first place?<br><br><br>If your car is overloaded with stuff in the trunk, then you might have trouble going up steep hills and such. Will you still complain to the manufacturer that 'suddenly your car got a lot slower for no reason'?<br><br><br>You keep yapping on about 'customers', but you seem to be forgetting that the whole point of a customer is that he chooses what he wants to buy or use. And contrary to what marketing dogma seems to teach, sometimes it's better not to have a customer. If they don't like it here, they are free to go elsewhere. AVS is a free product with no warranties or guarantees.<br><br>And you don't seem to have made a solution either. Should Nullsoft 'pull-an-AMD' and introduce its own resolution scale like AMD did for the megahertz thing (people were only looking at megehertz)?<br>"It runs at 320x240, but we call it 640+480++ because it offers as much enjoyment as a regular plug-in at 640x480".<br>People just have to deal with the fact that AVS doesn't run at high resolutions, it's that simple.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">encina</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th July 2003 19:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">UnConeD: I don´t understand your point!<br>What is it I don´t understand? - Have I claimed to be an expert? - Have I claimed that AVS isn´t impresive? No! AVS is impresive and nice looking, I just claim it´s a damn shame it kills my CPU while being it, resulting in that I will not use it.

The wishlist (not modified since June 2002) still isnt fulfilled, and its more than a year now.<br>And btw, you can always bitch about it in 'The Bitchlist' :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2003 09:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Just want to add that a 3.06ghz p4 with loads of superfast ram can run the majority of avs really smoothly at 640x480.<br><br>The whole thing with avs being slow is that it is really complex in ways other than graphical, most of what makes it slow is the fact that it has to interpret your code and use custom values... etc. if avs were taken as it were now and all of the effects were made hardware rendered i don't think that there would be much of a speed boost because of this.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">encina</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2003 11:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Ohh finally I succeded in making you understand my point, instead of thinking I was bitching you out :D<br><br>And UnConeD - yes I admit that sentence was unambiguous, but I was only trying to illustrate that as a developer you must accept the fact, that if a user/customer isn´t happy with your result, telling him that you spend 1000 hours doing it, he will still not be happy with your result. He would just think "Glad it wasn´t my time that was used for it" :(<br><br>shreyas_potnis - I´m beginning to understand that Nullsoft never looks through these files! I´ll remember "The bitchlist" :D<br><br>jheriko - Are you saying that AVS is a scripting language?<br><br>I´ve noticed another thing about AVS. I also read another threat about it. It seems to use 90% CPU resources no matter what resolution it runs in. The smaller the res the higher fps are achived. The threat was about fps-limmiting. If there is no proper object to use for wait() in AVS then you can never achive a fps-limmiter that doesn´t use the cpu! Meaning that no matter how you run AVS, how you write presets for it, or how big a CPU that is used, it will always use 90% CPU power!<br>Isn´t this correct?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">shreyas_potnis</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2003 17:37 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">AVS is partly scriptable, only ssc's, m's, md's, ds's, bump's, ddm's or any other i might have forgotten</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Phaze1987</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th July 2003 19:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">...shreyas means superscopes,movements,dynamic movements,dynamic shifts,bumps and dynamic distance modifiers.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
