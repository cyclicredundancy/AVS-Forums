      <p class="post-content"><strong>Bah! I thought I understood input/output and render order, but it would seem not...</strong><br />
      This is not making any sense to me. Here's how this preset is so far:<br />
      ---------------------------------------------------<br />
      Main 'clear every frame' UNchecked<br />
      <br />
      Effect list - 'clear every frame' checked<br />
      Render/Moving Particle - yellow<br />
      Trans/Water<br />
      Trans/Blur<br />
      <br />
      Effect list 'clear every frame' checked<br />
      Render/SuperScope - waveform - lines<br />
      ----------------------------------------------------------<br />
      Now, obviously my trouble is in the input and output blending<br />
      for the effect lists. I swear I tried every combination possible.<br />
      The scope is at the bottom of the screen (representing grass)<br />
      and the moving particle (which I plan to have a bunch of) is supposed to have the blur and water effect (representing fireflies).<br />
      Now, I thought that the way I have this set up, I would have the scope unaffected by anything, and the particle(s)with sort of a tracer effect. I'm not trying to get anyone to figure out my preset for me, but what the hell am I doing wrong? If you need, I will put what I have in a zip file. Sorry for the noob question, but I am trying to learn. Thank you in advance for your help. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">there is a really big problem here: you have your effects beside each other, with the effect lists. you have to put the effects INTO the effect list, not just before/after them! here is a modified and working version, just as to show you what you had wrong (and how i like it better ;)).<br />
      <br />
      Play with the inputs/outputs so you see the differences.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Damnit, okay I am confused about something. What the f%$# does the little plus or minus next to the effect list mean? I copied the preset exactly as you had it, hboy, except my effect lists had pluses instead of minuses. Okay, I clicked effect list again which gives me the one with the minus, but what is the point of having to add another? I even made it so I had it JUST like yours, with the minus signs, but when I opened it (after exiting AVS) they were pluses again! I realize I am confused on some fundamental 'nesting' concept as concerns effects lists, please help me understand it! Maybe there is some very basic bit of knowledge that I missed, I don't know. By the way, hboy, I saw a thread where you were pissed at somebody because they didn't want to take the time to learn for themselves. Please believe this is not the case with me. I have coding tutorials and effects tutorials right here on my desk, and I have read them a few times. *frustrated* :(</p>

      </blockquote>i dont really understand this, but i try to. the signs beside the effect list (EL from now on) is just a view marker, by + it means you have a closed look, by - you have it opened, just like in windows explorer folders. it has no effect on the preset if it is open or closed, if you restart AVS it will show every EL as open anyway. I dont know how you got "pluses" when reopening AVS, have no idea really. I always get minuses (that means the open view). But they dont really matter anyway.<br />
      <br />
      [edit]<br />
      <br />
      Note that empty effect lists always have a + sign beside them.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      and i did flame someone some time before, but he was a bit too unintelligent to understand what the whole forum tried to say. since then he's cool anyway :)<br />

      <p class="post-content">ok, thank you again hboy. I still am not sure what my trouble is, because I copied the way you had the preset faithfully, and it didn't look the same. But I'll be damned if I'm giving up. I will figure it out. But really thanks for what you have done. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">You know, I believe I have discovered the root of the problem I am having. when I double-click on an effect list in hboy's edited version, the list opens and closes the view of all the effects in that list. In mine, the effect lists all have a plus next to them and double clicking them does nothing at all. Now, maybe that only has to do with the being able to see the effects or not, but all I know is, I reproduced mine EXACTLY as hboy has his (except for the little plus or minus sign), and it is different. If anyone has any ideas as to what might be causing this, please share. I am going to try re-installing winamp (Oi!) but I don't know if this will fix the problem. If it doesn't, maybe I should move this thread to the actual winamp bugs section? Or, even though I am apparently the only one experiencing this 'bug' maybe someone at Nullsoft are the only people able to adress this sort of thing? Not taking anything away from you guys of course.:)</p>

      <p class="post-content">WOW! How freakin weird!! I didn't re-install winamp, but 'magically' it's ok now, I see the pluses AND minuses, double clicking works. Who the hell KNOWS what may have caused the problem, but all I know is, now I have to re-create all the presets I've made so far (yes, they are all 'stuck' with effect lists NOT showing or unshowing effects) and pay close attention to the way my presets go in the future. Sorry for this thread, but If I had one wish, it would be for someone to acknowledge that they can understand why I was frustrated! :P<br />
