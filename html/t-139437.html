It would make a big difference on the final outcome. Personally, I don't think they should be accumulative. If we did do it that way, then I don't think that we should kick anybody out each round. Just go 3-5 rounds and then take the final scores and determine the winner. But since we are kicking people out each round I don't think the scores should continue to add up.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th June 2003 20:26 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Good decision anubis, just slightly offtopic here but shouldn't it go to the point where there are quarter finals, semi finals and finals.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mikm</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th June 2003 20:56 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">wow...i'm amazed. :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">27th June 2003 20:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Could you guys please start next round not before tuesday?

Example:<br><br>First round is someonenotgoodatmath vs. UnConeD and the subject subject is krazy cool ray traced crap. Someonenotgoodatmath might be able to beat UnConeD while making any other type of preset, but he just happens to get this one and get knocked out unfairly.<br><br>I say the best contest would be: judges say "make a preset with just a superscope, a preset with no custom-programmable parts, a remix of BLANK, a copy of El-Vis's style, a preset that is clearly inspired by the title "giant orange hippo wearing a tutu", a good use of XOR, and a flow preset. No re-using old material. start NOW, submit your pack within fifteen days." and then after fifteen days the judges look through all the packs and gives each preset a score out of 10 points. The sum of each of the judges scores for a pack = the pack's total score. The judges can't talk to eachother or anyone else about the quality of the presets until they have all submitted their scores to the head judge (who doesn't vote and is a trustworthy person). The head judge releases the total scores after he recieves all the other judge's scores.<br><br>I think that this would be the fastest and fairest way to do a competition...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th June 2003 18:13 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">it's really too confusing for me:(</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Raz</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th June 2003 18:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice idea for a comp but i still like my isea, so what if people get knocked out straight away, they should've been better in that area, and anyway, it shouldn't be raytracing because only a few can do that, it should be a title, you know something anything can be done with.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Runar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th June 2003 18:38 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">A knockout tournament would have to be combined with a league, at least if this tournament's contestant amount is something to go after.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">13373571</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th June 2003 18:55 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Again raz, what if someone who isn't that good just happens to come up with a really good preset based on "satan's fearsome sci fi space furby" one round and knocks out someone who otherwise would've won the tournament but just couldn't come up with a good interpretation.

The root of Seraphim comes either from the Hebrew verb saraph ('to burn') or the Hebrew noun saraph (a fiery, flying serpent). Because the term appears several times with reference to the serpents encountered in the wilderness (Num. 21.8, Deut. 8.15; Isa. 14.29; 30.6), it has often been understood to refer to "fiery serpents." From this it has also often been proposed that the seraphim were serpentine in form and in some sense "fiery" creatures or associated with fire.<br><br>It is said that whoever lays eyes on a Seraph, he would instantly be incinerated due to the immense brightness of the Seraph. They are described as very tall, with six wings and four heads, one for of the cardinal directions. One pair of wings are for flying, one for covering their eyes (for even they may not look directly at God), and one for covering their feet (which is almost certainly a euphemism for genitalia). They are in the direct presence of God.<br><br>In Isaiah's call-vision in the Temple, he sees Seraphim surrounding the throne of God, singing praise to God; the "Thrice Holy" hymn (ch 6). In this instance they are angelic beings but in the Book of Numbers, seraph-snakes are sent to punish the Israelites.<br><br>Some of the Seraphim are Metatron, Kemuel, Nathanael, Gabriel, and Lucifer.</blockquote>Required:<br>- Bitmaps: skupers_lp7_01.bmp, skupers_lp7_02.bmp (included in the zipfile)<br>- Fonts: Arial (not included, it should come standard with windows, if you don't have it, just ask and I'll send it to you)<br>- APEs: Texer<br><br>Optimal resolution 320x200 for text, the actual preset will work in any resolution.<br><br><b>Read the comment inthe preset for more info about the preset!</b></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd July 2003 20:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice :), though I don't see what it has to do with the topic, except the nice story you added.

Should indeed have taken you quite some time to find that all out. Sorry skupers, I didn't mean to be so harsh (or wathever the word is, in Dutch, which you understand: lomp). Also the preset looks great, it also contains a shitload of quite some nice skills. It just didn't look like an angel to me, but then again, nobody knows how they look. I guess I expected something with wings and a golden ring on it's head or so. So, I take all my words back, and my excuses to skupers. It's a great preset with the best background I've yet seen.

We can open signup for it now already, I'm quite confident Raz will be in again, and so will I. It'll take some time for everyone who wants to to join in, so maybe open a new thread for it? That is, if there is enough interest in it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th August 2003 09:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I'm ready for it.

But yes, I agree on you becoming judge, you did a nice job previous tournament.<br><br>[edit]<br>so should I open a new topic for it? I guess almost everyone except previous round contestants don't read this topic, if we want more and new contestant we have to draw some attention ;).<br>[/edit]</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">sidd</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th August 2003 15:25 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ill be in again.<br>Though i seem to be spending too little time online, and too much time in the cinemas lately.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th August 2003 17:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">:) good to hear you're in, enjoy the movies.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
