      - Fixed the doublesize mouse issues.<br />
      - Optimized evallib more (woo fun shit writing stuff that generates x86 asm), generated code is now 40% smaller and slightly faster.<br />
      - Added evallib code stats in debug window.<br />
      - Reduced overall memory use.<br />
      <br />
      Woot. Thursday's gettin closer! hehe.<br />
      I think I am also gonna add setmousepos(x,y) soon, so that if the avs window has focus, the script can reset the mouse position, in order to detect movement (i.e. for mouse controlled relative movements)...<br />

      <p class="post-content">I'm experiencing a very weird bug with this alpha (using rc9).<br />
      Occasionally when loading a preset, the first 'n' components of it will be missing. Sometimes the entire preset is even entirely empty, and sometimes only the last component remains. How many components are missing seems completely random, even for the same preset.<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to figure out what causes it, but it's happening only occasionally.<br />
      I.e. if I flip around a lot with next/prev, it will occur sometimes.<br />
      <br />
      It happens both on large and small presets, on presets with or without effect lists and with or without apes.</p>

      and i just realized this...since when is there a limit on variable name lengths? if it was implimented after 2.6 it could cause problems for old presets. imo this is a really stupid idea in the first place...yes it does discourage cluttered code, but it can cause trouble if don't know about it in the first place....</p>

      </blockquote>Now I think about it, I do remember a few times where I thought I set a scope to lines, but later it was set to dots. I thought I just clicked wrong or something, but maybe it's a bug like you said.

      <p class="post-content">I just realized you implemented a rather big change in alpha behaviour for DM's... a gradient between alpha=0 and alpha=1 will not be the same as a gradient between alpha=-1 and alpha=2.<br />
      So basically AVS is interpolating between the coded alpha values, and clamping the interpolated result to 0..1.<br />
      <br />
      The previous behaviour was that alpha would clamp the gridpoint's alpha before interpolation. Some situations do benefit from the new style, but it should be a toggle not to clamp alpha before interpolation IMO, with old presets retaining the old behaviour. There are many presets that depend on the old style to pull off some visual tricks (like Retrosquares, which is included in the Winamp5 picks!).<br />
      Add alpha=max(0,min(1,alpha)); to the end of the point code in the first DM in Retrosquares to see how it should look. The second DM in retrosquares does benefit from the new behaviour, so it would be handy to be able to toggle.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      There was an alpha clamping bug, but this was not what was meant...<br />
      The bug was that when you get large alpha values, it starts toggling on/off randomly. You'd need to clamp alpha for this, however for the new alpha behaviour (if togglable) to be useful, you couldn't clamp at 0 and 1. I suggest determining the upper/lower limit for alpha based on code, and clamping at that.<br />
      <br />
      To see this in action, try this:<br />
      * Render / Clear Screen: White<br />
      * Trans / DM: No Movement, Blend only. Per point code: alpha=10<br />
      <br />
      Now add more zeroes to 10... sometimes the alpha will invert, for example at 1000.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      By the way, just letting AVS play in Winamp on random preset mode is enough to make it crash after couple of minutes.<br />
      The cause is reading a nullpointer. I'll see if I can figure out where.<br />
      <br />

      </blockquote>Actually, I didn't do what you thought, and make it clamp at each interpolated point... rather I was just fixing the clamping to clamp to 0..1 at each eval point. But my code was fucked, so clamping was disabled altogether. Oops. Here is the fixed version:<br />

      The exp1 (err now exp2 fixing the deadlock bug) is because this uses my new evallib version which has some pretty major architectural changes (supports unlimited variables yay!)... So if you notice any new eval related bugs let me know, and I'll either fix or revert to the old code if need be.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Justin could you make the text have codable x,y,size,on/off and it would be extra cool if it could be used as an array (would return length and you could set the index for the rendered word) multiline text would also kick ass but if you do the others that wouldnt be hard to do with code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not a bug but to consider:<br />
      <br />
      In previous version of AVS the image is lost on resizing the AVS-window. Now there is this option "reuse image on window resize" found in display settings which is turned on by default.<br />
      <br />
      I do not know if this thing really makes sense here. Especially when doing SSC/DynaMove-coding depending on w and h it is comfortable to get an empty image after resizing to start back from "black" with the new res. Plus with some extra-code one can check for resizing and then start drawing from the very start, i.e.<br />
      <br />
      Frame:<br />
      new=if(equal(resold,w*h),0,1);<br />
      resold = w*h;<br />
      ...<br />
      <br />
      Now with this new option some unwanted leftovers of the previous res stay on the screen which causes some of my presets to look ugly.<br />
      <br />
      I think this new option should be better placed somewhere inside a preset i.e. inside "main". So one can decide for every single preset if the image is kept on resizing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Using effect list coding you can do your own check though, and make every effect 'first frame/resize only'.<br />
      <br />
      By the way it's probably better to check w/h separately rather than their product.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's better to use h*1600+w instead, no one's really gonna run AVS at a higher horizontal resolution of 1600. Or if you can spare the division, h+1/w. This puts the height on the left, and width on the right of the decimal point, as we know that both w and h are integers.</p>

      <p class="post-content">True but FP multiplication and especially division are still slow. I'm not sure if branch prediction will have an effect on such a single piece of code.<br />
      <br />
      Remember though, due to the evallib changes, a lot of code that used to be slow will be fast now (best example: Neon Coaster which runs 3-4x faster).</p>

      when clicking the channel shift winamp crashes without even showing the menu, it happened in the final that came with wa5.<br />
      <br />
      *edit: nevermind, spotted the problem... the channel shift ape was still in the avs directory, this is what makes it crash.</p>
