      <p class="post-content"><strong>some presets...</strong><br />
      well here's my first presets, i'm just kinda curious to see if people like them at all.<br />
      <br />
      Also, i was wondering if anyone could tell me where i could find some information of doing dynamic movements and better superscopes, to get the 3d-like effects that the good avs people can do, because looking at the code for them is just plain impossible for me to decypher what's going on. :(<br />
      <br />
      oh, btw is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=66395" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=66395</a> the best i'm likely to find?<br />

      <p class="post-content">Hey, It's better than most starter packs I've seen. For me, the two best were "superguay" and "okay". You seem to have an okay grasp of 2d superscopes. The 3d stuff is harder (well duh :rolleyes: ). Nail the 2d stuff down pat first, cause everything in 3d is 2d, only with height.<br />

      <p class="post-content">An artist must decide whether to be a pioneer or to make stuff according to what people currently like. If an artist decides to become a pioneer, they have to decide on a style that people will like in the future. Some styles aren't destined to become popular, and some are. As an AVS preset developer, that choice is up to you.<br />
      <br />
      First off :) my personal preferred style doesn't match your style-so I don't want to come off as a grouch. The decision on my suggestions are up to you.<br />
      <br />
      Here goes: I'll start off with the positive. I thought the colors in the superscopes were especially cool in colorscope. My personal preference is to look at things a little bit less hyper than your preset. If you're not sure how to slow it down, I posted a suggestion. Aside from the business, I really liked its overall color effect.<br />
      <br />
      Again, your taste for hyperness is just a tad bit more than mine in the first SSC in Pool, but I liked the little SSC that went around and exploded. The color in the tunnel of the first SSC was nice.<br />
      <br />
      On superguay, I you did a nice job on the colors. I'm sure your next pack will be even better! You might consider adding a movement, but it's up to you<br />
      <br />
      I liked your preset Okay-because it had a dynamic shift, wasn't too hyper, and I found it quite a bit more than "okay" :)<br />
      <br />
      I saved the best for last: My favorite was kinda trippy! Great job on that preset. It isn't too hyper, its colors are superb! I wouldn't dare try to make suggestions for kinda trippy (that's quite a compliment-because I'd probably mess it up too much)<br />
      <br />
      I hope I didn't end up being too much of a grouch :)<br />
      <br />
      For a first pack, not bad!<br />

      Oops - Jaheckelsafar beat me to it :). I originally thought I would be the 1st post, so I wrote a more detailed thing. Now my post kind of seems out of place :D. Sorry about that.<br />
      <br />
      Peace to all of you AVS makers out there on this stormy night! (severe weather where I am, at least; and tornadoes to the NE of us)<br />

      <p class="post-content"><strong>thanks</strong><br />
      thanks for all of the responces, in responce to some of them...<br />
      <br />
      well, first off I found it kind of suprising that 'okay' was liked so well, that's actually my first preset (before i knew what a superscope did :)).<br />
      <br />
      2ndly, the reason a bunch of my presets don't have movement, is because the superscope seems to become lost. For example, in 'super guay' i wanted to add some simple movement, but whenever i did, the ability to see what the music had done a few seconds ago was lost.<br />
      <br />
      third thing: with 'color scope' i was trying to see if i could make a scope that you could see the music in by using the colors (obviously :)), and it kind of worked, although i admit is quite hard to... well follow the music? if you know what i mean..<br />
      <br />
      finally, 'kinda trippy', if you didn't notice (it's hard to from the angle which you see the scopes at) uses that cheap 3d effect, of where you have multiple 2d shapes intersect hence creating a thing that is suspossed to look 3d... i always thought that 'kinda trippy' might look cool from differnt "camera angles" and other such things beyond my skill level to implement well.<br />
      <br />
      once again thanks for all the responces and suggestions!</p>
