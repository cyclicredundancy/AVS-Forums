      <p class="post-content"><strong>Visualization only showing basic info of the song</strong><br />
      Hey<br />
      I wonder if someone could create a vizualisation showing all the info of the song thatÂ´s playing<br />
      Just something simple showing the CD picture, the album name and date, artist + song name<br />
      iÂ´ve been looking for something like this for a long time.<br />
      thanks for considering it<br />

      <p class="post-content">You're looking for a plug-in, not a visualization.<br />
      <br />
      But to reply to your question, I'll give you the picture of what you call 'simple':<br />
      <br />
      This plugin would have to have a database with every song from every album or single ever made, with images and all. Updated every minute of course.<br />
      <br />
      I highly doubt that anyone would be willing to maintain such a database</p>

      <p class="post-content">Excuse my ignorance there :D<br />
      Maybe something could read the ID3 tags en display them. IÂ´m just comparing with windows media player (and iPod) where you can see the album name, artist en stuff and even the album cover picture. Dunno how they did it there but itÂ´s something iÂ´d like to have for my winamp. Winamp only shows song name and artist and iÂ´m looking for a bit more info when i play a song.<br />
      I think the album picture is stored somewhere with the musicfile or something like that so i donÂ´t think making such a database is necesary.<br />

      <p class="post-content">WMP (is crap :p) and also when you rip a cd with it (to crappy formats) it downloads pictures and crap about that arist and put it in the folder where the album/music is saved.<br />
      There are plug-ins for winamp that will display the cd picture as well (but I'm not gonna look for you :))<br />
      And I don't think AVS is gonna a get a decent update any time soon which would accomodate getting extended song info. :weird:</p>

      <p class="post-content">AVS only reads the tracklength + position, playlist position number, artist name and the track title, nothing more.<br />
      <br />
      The cover image is not stored on a CD. WMP just sends your track information to one of Microsoft's servers to compare your track information with the information in their database (with also stores images). So, they also know what music you're playing, which is a very bad thing.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to have the cd cover for printing purpouses, I'd say just google for it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">There is an online database for doing this sort of thing - CDDB. I don't know if you need to pay to use it or not, or if it contains cover art, but everyone here is right that implementing something like this is not trivial. Looking up track names in ID3 tags is not a reliable way to identify a track, for instance. Even using file sizes is flakey since there are usually many rips of any given track... as well as user defined formats etc... MD5 hash goes out for the same reason, with the added reason that .mp3 files are often corrupted without anyone noticing (they have good error correction)... I've often wondered exactly how some of these technologies work that identify a song from a generic file... maybe some kind of huge FFT with some fuzzy logic?<br />
      <br />
      EDIT: apparently CDDB and FreeDB only work on cds, and they only work by generating a hash (almost unique id) for the whole CD, not individual tracks.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Not that hard?</strong><br />
      To my insight, it shouldn't be that hard?<br />
      Why can iTunes show the cover art of the files it is playing and more info? Because the information is already at your PC :) (or Mac for that matter ;))<br />
      <br />
      In other words, is there a plugin or visualisation that can show the Cover Art, Playtime, Track title, album and artist when you've correctly tagged them? (my collection is al properly tagged, with cover art)<br />
      <br />
      Thanks in advance.</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Re: CD Art Display</strong><br />
      Okay looks like a nice application, but it isn't a visualization in any way... so IMO this thread still belongs in TechSupport (like I said 2 years ago :weird: ) - where you were also more likely to get a good answer.</p>
