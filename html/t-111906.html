      <p class="post-content">Jesus Christ this sucks!<br />
      <br />
      1: Help opens in the browser window closest to the top (BIG no no)<br />
      2: Edit console not nearly as user friendly as AVS's<br />
      3: Control console ""<br />
      4: Default presets are even more boring than AVS's<br />
      5: Mocha:AVS::MacOS:Windows, in that Mocha may be better but AVS is still more widely used/developed for (so developers will get better criticism and 'mere mortals' will get a bigger variety of presets).<br />
      6: There's no 'hard' render (this pixel = this color, instead of this pixel = the color of that pixel over there plus a little bit of the color of this pixel here...) that I can find.<br />
      7: Is it just me, or is this thing hella slow, considering how little code it is processing?<br />
      <br />
      The list goes on. There's no worth in going to that site guys, it's a waste of time.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mocha is three years old or something and it ruled back then. Now AVS is a lot better :). /me did a lot of mocha presets :)<br />
      <br />
      Mocha had a lot of things that AVS doesn't even have, partially because the guy who developed it usually implemented suggestions pretty fast:<br />
      - Native Hue/Sat/Lum support<br />
      - Bitshifting operators<br />
      - Syntax highlighting<br />
      <br />
      Plus it has the ability to auto-remix presets (mutations). Though this can produce some really neat results, it also resulted in some totally unskilled people getting their 'Ã¼ber-leet' presets published, even though all they did was let it mutate until it looked cool.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sure there's more, but I can't remember out of the top of my head. Just because something is not AVS, it can still be good Atero :P. Just like Geiss isn't spectacular today, or Chtuga.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Personally i think it sounds interesting although i haven't checked it out... yet :)<br />
      <br />
      Can someone give links to mocha sites? (like where to publish presets)<br />
      Im at school and my time is limited, also im a bit lazy to find out myself :D (please don't hate me! *runs for cover from the flying knifes*)<br />
      <br />
      But plugins like Acidspunk (the only one i have actually checked out besides avs, if we don't count women that jump up&amp;down in tight shirts) that are totally un-cus-to-mi-ze-ble (phuck, is it how you spell it?) are a big no no :down: Sure you can get incredible framerates, but they get old really fast /me thinks.<br />
      <br />
      Long Live AVS!<br />
      <br />
      uhm... was this just <i>slightly</i> off topic? :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, mocha sounds interesting and i want to check it out.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well both AVS and Milkdrop whoop Mocha's ass, but nevertheless it was a neat plug-in :).<br />
      <br />
      In fact, a Mocha-ape (i.e. per-pixel formula) would be really cool for AVS. Perhaps with a variable grid size so that it renders at half/quarter/etc resolution for speedup reasons.<br />

      <p class="post-content">nixa, no Acidspunk is a plugin for wa2 i believe it is still in the most downloaded list at classic.winamp.com and you can't customize it like avs, only choose a resolution or something like that (hey it was a long time ago i checked it...) And the preset was "Techno Punk" and yes i kind of got the name from acidspunk :p<br />
      <br />
      And i don't think i will ever test milkdrop with the computer i have...</p>
