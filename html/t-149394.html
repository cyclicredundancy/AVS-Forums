      OK just want to give you guys the latest build<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~deadbeef/avs27pre3.zip" target="_blank">http://genghis.winamp.com/~deadbeef/avs27pre3.zip</a><br />
      <br />
      what's new:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>fixed memory leak in evallib introduced in 2.7pre2</li>

        <li>added seperate debug window with register watch, compilation error listing</li>

        <li>made variable clearing on recompile optional for development</li>

        <li>woo undo/redo system (thanks largely to mig) - not ideal but definately handy</li>

        <li>fixed/upgraded the trans / movement functionality, pretty usable for starting with a particular preset and editting</li>

        <li>added blend modes to misc / buffer save</li>

        <li>made effect lists expanded by default on load</li>

        <li>made y/u nav wrap again :)</li>
      </ul><br />
      Going to add Unconed's simpler APEs soon, I think.<br />
      <br />
      Also, for the eval help, will probalby just include a .html (AVS primer stripped down?) and have AVS spawn on demand, perhaps to the right section. Sound good to ppl?<br />
      <br />
      (edit: oh yeah, need to add Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y for undo/redo eh)<br />

      With this version of avs(pre) I have experienced some very weird crashes this happens allways (with one exeption) when I'm coding a ssc...<br />
      I can not say what causes this but I'm sure there is a bug in it (d'uh)...<br />
      This crash even sucks more than usual onese :P that give me a chance to save my preset :hang:, i must say this REALLY sucks.<br />
      <br />
      If it's needed i can send the preset whan i was/am working on, it has crashed allready 3 times.<br />
      If i get more info about those crashes then ill let you know.<br />
      Oh, once it crashed when it was loading preset, it cant be varjable limit... prolly it is about global varjables... or maybe not.<br />
      help... :(<br />
      <br /></p>

      </blockquote>personaly i think it would be better to add it to 'expression help'... and add a tutorial option...<br />
      well, maybe its not that good idea...<br />

      <br />
      Mind my english if its really bad :p

      <p class="post-content">I really like the solid grid, though nothing seems to go wrong here. I played around with your code a bit, most of the time fucking it up, though nothing weird like crashes. Also I loaded the presets about 10 times. No crashes at that as well.<br />

      1) more scratch area or global variables, enough to allow my midi recieving plugin to transmit a whole 16 channels of midi events<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Don't think this was mentioned before, but entering variables with charector lengths over eight, store the variable using only the first eight charectors. ie: abcdefgh=0; abcdefghi=1; If you would then try to recall abcdefgh, it would return 1, and trying to use abcdefghi would result in your code not working.</p>

      <p class="post-content">2 small wishes for AVS 2.7, hope they'll get in. Other people, let me know what you think of them.<br />
      <br />
      1. the next/previous buttons on the AVS window, like in winamp 3.0<br />
      2. Extra ability for coding: to format variables to a certain number of decimals. For example, to format a 10 decimal variable to a 2 decimal variable. It can be useful together with the global vars, for example to trigger a different scope if 2 others are at a certain location.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Heres a bit of a bug with the effect list on the left thats always really pissed me off.<br />
      <br />
      Clicking and draging an effect, but not moving it from its position (so you get the 'move here' thingo to show up.. but still in the same position as before), results in it being moved one spot down the list. Even though it will still appear in its original position on the list. It only shows up in the correct position once you restart AVS.<br />
      <br />
      There are also a few other weirdiums like this that generally result in stuff appearing in the worng place. So perhaps the best idea would be to just make the list auto refresh from the avs file, rather than ironing out all of the bugs.</p>

      <p class="post-content">well one odd bug i just found this afternoon...sign(x) doesn't return the sign of x. it returns something slightly smaller than the sign of x, but still within the bounds of avs's required accuracy to be called 1. for example: sign(1)=0.9999900001, and sign(16)=0.99999937500039. it appears this number gets larger as the argument does.<br />
      also in this process i found out that avs disregards anything past the fifth decimal point - including 0's. thus, 0.99999=1, and 0.000001=0. this is true for all of the boolean functions (equal, if, below, above, bor, bnot, and band.<br />
      <br />
      speaking of band...you oughtta get rid of that nastyass indent in the expression help :)<br />
      <br />
      speaking of the expression help...you oughtta document use of whitespace and the old comment chars - any charachter above a certain number, forget which...but it includes alt+0160 (hard space).</p>

      <p class="post-content">Seems there is one line drawing bug which I had forgotten about.<br />
      <br />
      Diagonal lines don't seem to get clipped into the view window correctly, because there is noticable slowdown with lines spanning huge coordinates.<br />
      <br />
      E.g. Set render mode, line width=100, Superscope, n=2, draw lines.<br />
      <br />
      If you use the following for per point:<br />
      x=(i*2-1)*100000;y=0;<br />
      There is no noticable slowdown (this is a horizontal line).<br />
      If we change it to:<br />
      x=(i*2-1)*100000;y=i;<br />
      however (which is almost 100% the same in the visible area), the preset is slowed down a lot.<br />
      <br />
      This is annoying for line-heavy scopes because you have to include some basic clipping into the code.</p>

      <p class="post-content">After a night of AVSing I've come to the conclusion that this version is a LOT more unstable than 2.6.<br />
      <br />
      Crashes have happened when:<br />
      - Adding a new component to a preset<br />
      - Starting to play music in winamp<br />
      - Changing code around<br />
      <br />
      In all cases, AVS attempts to read from an almost-nullpointer (i.e. probably a nullpointer to a struct/object that is being used).<br />
      Unlike AVS2.6's code crashes, after this happens it's impossible to save the preset by moving the 'this program has performed an illegal operation...' box away and using the AVS editor dialog before clicking 'close'. The editor *is* still responsive to mouse/keyb events, but saving causes a hang and after restarting AVS it turns out the save did not happen at all.</p>

      2- you dont understand what i mean at all. when the screen is drawn it often displays 2 frames seperated by a horizontal 'tear' because it doesnt sync or double-buffer, 'wait for refresh' doesnt seem to have any effect at all. i know a lot of you guys like using fullscreen mode which DOES doublebuffer but i like to tweak presets while they are running.<br />

      <p class="post-content">The new APE 'SDK' is great, the ability to access the global registers and use 'evallib' is great.. its a shame that there is no documentation or example of adding 'evallib' to an APE. The lazy half of me made an ape to demonstrate how you can use code in a SSC or DM to 'send' an ape values via a global register. This could be a good alternative to including a messy code box on a 3D ape, when you could infact send ox,oy,oz,rx,ry,rz vars through global registers to synch the APE rendered object with superscopes and DMs and such.<br />
      <br />
      Maybe everyone already noticed.. but I think that this is probably the best thing about this version of AVS, making APE more powerful will help make AVS much better in the long term than anything else.<br />

      Contents of zip file:<br />
      <br />
      ape.avs<br />
      avstut00.ape<br />

      Don't go about using this APE for anything, or distributing it.</p>
