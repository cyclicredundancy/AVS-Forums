Usually I know who made what, even if the author's name is not in the filename, but there are some I don't know who made them.<br><br>So here's are two requests:<br>- Please save your preset as 'Author - Preset name.avs'. This makes it much easier to organise and find your presets. If I'm looking for a Tuggummi preset, I just hit 't' until I find it.<br>I think this one is pretty easy to do, and offers a huge advantage for everyone.<br><br>- Secondly, and this will probably get more resistance; When posting, put your preset in a subdir with your name in it. Organising presets in the root, even with the author's name in front of it, is still very messy. So make a folder named after you, and put your presets that are not packaged yet in there.<br><br>These guidelines would only apply to single (or few) presets posted here of course, not for entire packs (which should have their own subdir anyway).<br>It would make it much easier to organise and enjoy everyone's work. :cool:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st September 2003 14:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Your wish is my command master! :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Rovastar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st September 2003 14:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah good idea.

So you'd put all your single stuff in Tuggummi. I'd put all my single stuff in UnConeD, etc.<br><br>Note though, the second guideline is very optional and only useful if you post a lot of stuff, but there's no real reason not to use the first.<br><br>The main problem I have is that if a preset has bitmaps with it (quite common these days), I cannot extract it into a subdir myself, without going through the trouble of making sure the bitmaps are in the AVS root.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st September 2003 14:51 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Well anyway, i expect everybody will be taking advantage of subdirs as soon as wa5 comes out. Then i will move all my own stuff under "Tuggummi" folder with the pack folders separetly and then the singles folder. So singles would go to "avs\Tuggummi\Singles" and packs would go to "avs\Tuggummi\packname". Im not sure yet will i uptade the old packs installers tho... seems like a lot of work for 18 packs :(<br><br>Also organizing presets of other people will require quite a bit of work, but if everybody would agree to some similiar naming system, then i think it would be easier for everyone to start using subdirs :) This would of course require every artist to uptade their installers...<br><br>I don't know, is it better if we each individually organize our presets as we please, or would a common 'agreement' help cut down the work?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">anubis2003</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st September 2003 15:28 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">This sounds like a good idea.
