Well, I don't want to be rude, but do you think that 640X480 @ 256 colors looks good? Resolution and the number of colors are the only things that matter when it comes to video. Pixel doubling looks terrible! I can run Q3 at 800X600 32-bit color and get 125 fps(and that is OpenGL accelerated).

AVS fps counter uses black voodoo magic that is far beyond my understanding, but it seems to measure it based on buffer updates somehow. I would dig in the source and find a definite answer, but I'm far too lazy for that...<br><br>I don't think this ruins the benchmark anyway. Stuff like vsync and double buffering are a part of the system configuration and their effects should be measured by a benchmark as much as stuff like CPU and RAM.</td><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></tr></table></div></div></body></html>
