      <p class="post-content"><strong>Figure this one out...</strong><br />
      Okay, I have two different versions of a dynamic movement. One of them works fine, the other doesn't work when you first load it; you have to cut and re-paste the contents of the "pixel" box. The problem is that I don't like the way that the one that works looks. :cry: Can somebody spot why the other one's not working?<br />
      <br />
      The one that works:</p>
      <pre>
<code>Init:<br />int=acos(-1)/4096;t=0;fs=1;fc=1<br /><br />Frame:<br />t=t+int;<br />st=sin(t);sy=sin(y);ct=cos(t);cx=cos(x);<br />cs=st*sy;cc=ct*cx;<br />fs=fs*.7+cs*.3;fc=fc*.7+cc*.3<br /><br />Pixel:<br />x=x/fc;<br />y=y/fs<br /><br />blend off, wrap on, rect coords on, BF on, grid 1x1</code>
</pre><br />
      The one that doesn't work:
      <pre>
<code>Init:<br />int=acos(-1)/4096;t=0;cs=1;cc=1;sy=1;cx=1;st=1;ct=1;<br /><br />Frame:<br />t=t+int;<br />st=sin(t);sy=sin(y);ct=cos(t);cx=cos(x);<br />cs=st*sy;cc=ct*cx;<br /><br />Pixel:<br />x=x/cc;<br />y=y/cs;<br /><br />all other options same as previous</code>
</pre><br />
      If you're wondering why all those "xxx=1"s are in the init in the second one, it's because I was trying to make sure that it wasn't trying to divide by zero.<br />
      <font size="1">By the way, I don't care if you don't like how this DM looks. I'm not asking for your opinion, I'm asking why it doesn't work. Thank you very much.</font>

      <p class="post-content">What's with having sin(y) and cos(x) in the FRAME: area? That will always be the same(just the sine of the last y value and cosine of the last x value). Also, you don't need to do that "xxx=1" stuff, because AVS will just ignore divide by zero's. One possible error is because the second one multiplies 2 trig functions, which can fairly often result in a very low number.</p>

      <p class="post-content">-I figured that calculating the sin and cos of y and x in the "frame" box would recalculate the values every frame (because wouldn't x and y be different for every frame?)... or maybe I'm just a dimwit... :p<br />
      -I didn't know AVS ignored "divide by zero"s... thanks for the tip.<br />
      -A resulting very low number still wouldn't explain why it works if you cut (i.e. remove) the stuff in "pixel" and then put it back in...<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for the help anyway. :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Actually, in an earlier version of the not-working one, I used the same variable names (fc and fs) as in the working one. It still didn't work then, but the variable names do work, because they're in the current working one. *reads that back and gets all googly-eyed* :S I will try changing the variable names, though. ANYthing to get this damn preset working. :hang:<br />

      <p class="post-content">Oh and clinical, the only thing that may make sin(x) and cos(y) different each frame is the fact that you assign new values to them, but I still don't think that it will be different.</p>

      <p class="post-content">not those, others. wierd ones like "spdx" (outta the blue, don't ask) don't work in SOME scopes, but work in others. very odd indeed. if you've checked your math and your syntax a hundred and seventeen times over and it still doesn't work the way it's supposed to...find where the errors start and change the name of the variable. nine times out of ten it'll work like a charm</p>

      </blockquote>Actually, even I'm not quite sure what it's <u>supposed</u> to be. It's one of those presets that you'll hate if you don't like intensely "flashy" presets. I used a couple bass spins, a scatter, that dm, and a dynamic distance modifier (in case you didn't know, I'm not really "about" technically impressive presets). My friends and I think it looks pretty neat, and that's really all I care about. :) I'll try changing the variable names tonight, thanks for the help everyone.

      <p class="post-content">As a matter of fact the simplest variable I know which doesn't work is 'ch', weird though why it wouldn't work. Another weird thing is that the variable 'b' (which is used for beat detection) is only set at the start of a frame, and can have any value you like between then. Odd.</p>

      </blockquote>Forget it. Some of my best presets had no point when I created them. Maybe it's not your style, but ordered chaos works fine for some people. :p<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, I think I've solved the problem: AVS hates me. I tried changing the variable names to several different things... nothing. I tried rearranging the equations... nothing. I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that I created the original preset in WA2 and am running it in WA3... nah...
