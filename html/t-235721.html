It's my first time here, as you may notice, and I just got a little question about the <b>vis_avs.dll</b> file in Winamp. Turns out that I got a PI machine with 32 MB of RAM Memory (before you say it: yes, it's juuust crappy), and when I try to use the latest AVS plugin, a message pops out and tells "CANNOT RUN AVS - GET THE NON-MMX AVS VERSION" or something like that... I know what's MMX and why mi computer can't use it, but I just wonder if you know anything about a <b>Non-MMX Version of AVS 2.81b</b>, or I just have to keep using the good 'ol AVS version 2.5 (I think)... Thanks anyway...<br><br><br>(PD: I apologize miself if I didn't make miself understand, my english... well, sucks XD...)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">PAK-9</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2006 20:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">You have discovered AVS, that <b>is <u>wonderful</u></b>, AVS can offer hours of fun and amazement, it is a fun tool to play with and it is a great thing to watch at while you play your favourite music.<br><br>However you have asked a AVS related question that has been asked &amp; answered several times before. Here in the AVS forums we respect and value such skills as:<br><br><b><u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/search.php" target="_blank"><font size="3">Searching</font></a></u></b><br>Simply put: Search before you post, you might have already seen the <b><font color="red">bold red letters</font></b> above the posting window, or you might have missed them for some reason, maybe red isn't a striking or alarming color to you. By searching for the answer you're looking for, you will get the answer you want <b>immediately</b>, instead of posting a question that has been posted before and <b>waiting</b> for a reply which usually takes several hours, sometimes even <u>days</u> to get and it might not even be a reply you will appreciate.<br><br><b><u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82567" target="_blank"><font size="3">Reading the FAQ</font></a></u></b><br>If you didn't know, FAQ stands for: <b>F</b>requently <b>A</b>sked <b>Q</b>uestions, it simply is a list of questions and answers to questions that over the long period of time have been asked multiple times. Since answering these questions each time they are asked can get boring and time wasting, we prefer usually not to answer them directly, but rather point you to the FAQ, where a pre-written and descriptive answer can be read. The FAQ explains the situation and solution much better than a quick reply by someone else.<br><br><b><u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank"><font size="3">Checking out the tutorials</font></a></u></b><br>Striving to be an AVS artist? That <b>is <u>wonderful</u></b>. Have a question about how to make something in AVS? Before you post this question it is recommended and <b>expected</b> by other AVS artists that you read the AVS tutorials enlisted <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=209060" target="_blank">here</a>, before you post your question. The tutorials are a wonderful source created by long time AVS artists to learn the basics and sometimes even the more complex features of AVS. Realize that since this is a hobby for most of us, no one is going to hold your hand and teach you AVS from ground up. Believe it or not, but <b>all</b> of us have learned AVS by <b>ourselves</b>, some of the people who have been AVS artists for years didn't even have these wonderful tutorials at disposal and we had to learn everything by experimenting! You are indeed <b>lucky</b> to have such great resources available to you, use them well and wisely, but most importantly <b>read them</b> before you <b>ask</b>.<br><br>Remember these guidelines and you should have no problems in your AVS future. And welcome to the AVS forums :up:<br><br>- :winamp: Winamp AVS team</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">AntaresMHD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th January 2006 20:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks!!
