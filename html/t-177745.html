I especially enjoy AVS option, and if you permit, I have a suggestion that perhaps may make people dance in front of their computers.<br><br>The suggestion is that you add a "user input transition" to your two present transitions: random and music. I mean making some user interaction such as Keyboard, mouse or gamepad, available with AVS. I think that would be a simple thing to do.<br><br>But think about it; people would be playing against their FAVORITE music for some acheivement. And that would make people's brain dance with their favorite music through their finger tips.<br><br>I am eager for such a product. Since AVS has advanced so much, thanks to Lord, I would prefer to have "user input transition" added to AVS, and be an end user of it this way easily. I might have created a whole new program and sell it myself, if there were not such facility as AVS available.<br><br>Thanks for your product,<br>And Thanks for your attention,<br>Kayvan Barin</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mikm</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd April 2004 22:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">AVS does have keyboard/mouse support.<br>I don't understand what you mean by "music transitions", though.<br>If you want to manually cycle, use Y and U.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd April 2004 22:43 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">It's still up to someone to code the presets.

"I want the preset reward me for pressing a key" you have to admit that does sound pretty vague :)<br>Some people will think this as the pump/zoom effect (think blitter feedback) Some may consider it as some short-time jiggly movement, some may think it changes colors...<br><br>If you're going to request someone to do this for you, you should be more specific as to what effects you want the preset do from different key presses. But coding this in AVS would be a pain in the ass indeed, currently avs artists seem to concentrate on making 1-3 different interactive features on a single preset, so making a preset that would react to every possible key on the keyboard would be a enourmous ammount of work and im not just talking code here. The concept &amp; design would be a workload also and im not sure so many people with knowledge of avs would be so interested in making it, sorry :( But then again this is only <b>i</b>n <b>m</b>y <b>h</b>umble <b>o</b>pinion</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">K1Barin</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2004 19:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Sorry you guys for my poor English, as well as my lack of knowledge. But let me say it again:<br>When you program a preset, i believe effects can be manipulated in two ways, random or music (spectrum, beat etc.). What i am proposing is another means of effecting preset as well: user interaction. making an interface like that and have all the effects available to that i think would not be that difficult.<br>the rest of the job is by the author of preset to manage a harmonious interaction of finger tips and anybody's favorite music.<br><br>K1Barin</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mikm</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2004 21:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yes, it is possible, but like we've said, the author of the plugin would have to code it directly into the preset, which would be extremely hard code-wise.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">TomyLobo</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">24th April 2004 22:00 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">i think you are referring to the built-in effects...<br>there are also fully customizable effects, so-called codable effects.<br>these include Superscope, Movement, Dynamic Movement, Texer II.<br>You can do nearly everything with them, including getting user input with the "getkbmouse" function. click the "expression help" button on any of these, click Functions and scroll down to the "getkbmouse" function for its description.<br>if you don't know anything about coding, read the faq thread in the AVS forum, search the forums for Atero's AVS primer and pir's tutorial</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">K1Barin</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th April 2004 14:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for your information. If you permit I make a reduced wish for AVS:<br><br>AVS internals have means of detecting music (beat, spectrum etc.). And there is always possible to trigger anything by random or these music related things. If it would be possible to add another source of triggering any effect (etc.): user input, then that would be very simple to incorporate what I was suggesting in the first place.<br><br>Anyway it may be not that popular, and it would not be worth the trouble. When I was watching the AVS's, I imagined myself interacting with them, and it felt like dancing. Now this would be my final version of my wish.<br><br>Regards<br>Kayvan Barin</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mikm</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">25th April 2004 17:07 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">When AVS detects a beat, it goes into the "b" variable- 1 = beat, 0 = nobeat.<br><br>AVS sends music data into the "v" variable (0 - 1 for spectrum, -1 to 1 for oscilliscope).

With codable effect list's it is very possible without much of a slow down. I.e. One push would activate water filter for a period of time, one would change the brightness with the color modifier, one would add bump effect etc. That is possible, but you can't change the effects with it, water filter will always do only one thing and it can't be changed (it can be altered with different blendings with a effect list, but that's not the point).<br><br>Uhm what im saying that if you took it up to make it and learn how to do it, you could eventually do something like that :) I doubt too many people would be willing to do it for you.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
