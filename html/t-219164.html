Or maybe even so that when a person is sleeping, and their computer is in their room, the monitor may end up not producing so much lite if any at all.<br>I don't like my monitors to actually turn off, nor do I really use a screensaver, my comps are set to show a BLANK screen, so that when not in use, it looks off.<br>So yeah, it really would be handy if AVS disabled the screensaver or monitor off functions.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th July 2005 23:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I like the idea of having AVS as screen saver.<br><br>One issue though..<br>- Screen savers are only used to have something to look at while your pc is in powersave mode.
