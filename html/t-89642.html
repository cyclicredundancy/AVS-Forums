So when you type:<br></p><pre>
<code>red=blue</code>
</pre><br>AVS will register the variables r, re, red and b, bl, blu, blue.<br><br>The library doesn't remove unused variables (or AVS doesn't), so the only way to get rid of them is to save and reload your preset. I've also noticed that sometimes (when you already have a lot of variables) AVS won't register new ones. Again, the only fix is save/reload.<br><br>Milkdrop doesn't have this problem because you have to hit CTRL-ENTER to apply your code (or at least it doesn't suffer from it as much). I don't think there's ever been a MD preset that hit the limit. In AVS though it's much easier, for example if you wish to store a point in a 3D superscope, you have to use 3 variables (x,y,z). It adds up easily.<br><br>I guess you could try and see how many variables MD and AVS can take... you'll know you hit the limit when it crashes :D</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Rovastar</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2002 18:14 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">:)<br><br>MD is different to AVS the expression library is nothing to do with the variables.:)<br><br>We do have a limit of about 30-40 variables and when writing presets sometimes we hit the limit.<br><br>But the way MD works is that if you have gone over the limit those subsequent variables no matter what you have assigned to them are as null, well zero.<br><br></p><blockquote>AVS will register the variables r, re, red and b, bl, blu, blue</blockquote>Urrrgh that is truely horrible. :eek: :igor: :weird: :down: :eek:</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">thejby2k</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">3rd June 2002 22:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>sucks like hell</strong><br>its sucks as bad ass your face:down: :down: :blah: :blah: :p :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ryan</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2002 01:08 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Im glad we just have shunuchs to deal with Rova =), they got this guy.<br><br>BTW Rova heres what it says in Ryan's preset guide about this...<br><br><br></p><blockquote>....Following is a list of the functions supported by the expression evaluator.<br>The list was blatently ripped from the help box of Justin Frankels' AVS<br>plug-in, since MilkDrop uses the expression evaluator that he wrote.</blockquote></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">YaPoNDeeZzZzz..</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2002 01:12 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>haha</strong><br>dude this foo is funny = thejby2k<br><br>i think he a envious bitch though...but he does make me laugh ..how stupid can he be calling UnConeD stupid ? lol:p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">ryan</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2002 01:15 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>look to the left..u see my icon..yes..do u get it?..no?...let me explain...im from YAP..a small island next to guam...so im YAPESE...<br>YA peace PRIDE</blockquote>Best sig ever :D :D :D :up: :up: :up:</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">thejby2k</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2002 01:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>fuck you</strong><br><a href="http://www.fuckyoubitches.com" target="_blank">www.fuckyoubitches.com</a> i find out that your stupid so your name is in the hall of fame jackass:D :D by the way it sucks dont download it!!!!!!!!!:down: :down: :down: :down: :down: :down: :blah: :blah: getting tired of sayinf it:o :o :o :down: :down: :down: :down: :down:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">4th June 2002 01:57 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah YaPoNDeeZzZzz's avatar is cool, except that the "Ya" looks like "Yo" to me.
