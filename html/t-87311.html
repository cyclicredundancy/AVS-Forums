This is for width wpix = 2 / w and for height hpix = 2 / h<br><br>To fill an horizontal SSC all you need is to draw a line to a music value in y then make the next point go one pix right on x and back down to zero on y and then go for the next music value and so on.<br><br>So every music value needs two points to be completed which leads to n = w * 2<br><br>All values need to be set in FRAME since they are affected by changes in screen-resolution i.e. by switching from windowed to fullscreen mode.<br><br>All we need now is a switch which makes the two steps ( music value and then back to zero ) happen ( ct in the following example ).<br><br>Gradients in a SSC simply could be achieved by using the sine of i on setting the colors.<br><br>So here's the complete basic solid-gradient-SSC setup:<br><br>FRAME:<br>wpix = 2 / w ;<br>n = w * 2;<br>xp = -1 ;<br>ct = 0 ;<br>fr = fr + 0.02<br><br>POINT:<br>ct = bnot ( ct ) ;<br>vv = if ( ct , getosc (i , 0.1 , 0 ) , 0 ) ;<br>xp = if ( bnot ( ct ) , xp + wpix , xp ) ;<br>x = xp ; y = vv ;<br>red = abs ( sin ( i * 2 + fr ) ) ;<br>green = abs ( sin ( i * 3 + 2 * fr ) ) ;<br>blue = abs ( sin ( i * 4 + 3 * fr ) )<br><br>The look of the SSC is changed by manips of the second line in point. Check out these for example:<br>vv = if ( ct , getosc (i , 0.1 , 0 ) , - vv ) ;<br>vv = if ( ct , - getspec (i , 0.1 , 0 ) , 0 ) ;<br>vv = if ( ct , getspec (i , 0.1 , 0 ) , - vv ) ;<br><br>The gradient here is very simple. To make it more random you may wish to setup some beat reaction like this:<br><br>BEAT:<br>b1 = rand ( 20 ) / 100 - 0.1 ; i1 = rand ( 6 ) ;<br>FRAME:<br>f1=f1+b1<br>POINT:<br>red = sin ( i * i1 + f1)<br><br>Have fun in experimenting with this basic setup.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">EL-VIS2</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">10th May 2002 11:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Sorry,<br><br>realized too late that there is already a threat on this started by montana38.<br><br>So I tried to delete this here and add it to Montanas thread but access to deletion was denied...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th May 2002 23:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I think a couple of things in this post can be misleading.

I think what's important is to set n = w * 2 and do this in FRAME to make shure n is always twice the screen width. It is important to do this in FRAME and NOT in INIT since INIT is only done once on startup and then never again even if the user switches from windowed to fullscreen mode which may differ in width.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">l TylerDurden l</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th January 2004 10:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Yeah! :) I've finally found the thread I was looking for. I had been trying to make a ssc which would look like the solid simple spectrum render but have faild due to my stupidity and lack of experience :) Now... I've tested every solution posted here: they are grate, unfortnately don't work the way I'd like them to. Ok what I mean is: if I set render mode to 10 pixels and add a solid simple spectrum render it looks quite nice. But that doesn't seem to work with any of the examples posted in this thread. What I get this blocky type simple (which I'm aiming for) but every block is finished with a short, thin line (which I am not aiming for :) ) Is there a way of getting rid of it?

You can probably do more effecient solid scopes using the newer AVS features like skip. Many of the optimization tips in code here are also not valid anymore due to changes in evallib behaviour.<br><br>I suggest you post your preset in a new thread so people can look at it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">shreyas_potnis</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">12th January 2004 12:30 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">You can also use this.
