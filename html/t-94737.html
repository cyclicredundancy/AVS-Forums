      I dont know how farfetched this is but perhaps we can have some kind of limiter so that no matter how fast that persons computer is it cant refresh at more than XX FPS?</p>

      Are you referring to a limter for all the AVS presets or for a variable that could be accessed in the presets themselves for the authors.<br />
      <br />
      Either way I do not know how useful it will be. Although both are very possible to do.<br />
      <br />
      For general I do not see the point. At least not at the moment. What presets would you be referring too and what monster machine to you have?<br />
      <br />
      Unless I suppose you are running them in a very small window....otherwise just up the res.<br />
      <br />
      More the presets themselves a current FPS would probably be more useful as it would be more versatile. You could adjust the complexity of the presets depending on the FPS but this is pain for the authors and I do not know if many/any will do it.</p>

      </blockquote>now i'm speeking with an avs artist with an really slow computer, now whatta fuck are you talking about, boy?<br />
      <br />
      i know what you mean but still when sertain artist begs for more fps, then nobody tries to say why can't we have fps limiter,<br />
      certain presets looks good at fast fps so knock it off.

      my computer sucks. There's some presets that lose the effect if at too high fps. I'm quite sure that everyone here has a faster computer than me. I dont know how my presets are going to look at 50fps. Im sure it will be different than what im seeing. Since you're saying its not too much trouble, is there any harm in just adding one? If just for me? :)<br />
      <br />
      Oh yeah to questions.<br />
      <br />
      yes this would be for the author. Like I may want to say I dont want this person to see this at more than 30 fps, or in most cases just leave it off.<br />
      <br />
      This would be seperate for each preset, im not asking for a limiter n the program, im talking about something I could add (like from the misc or trans menu).</p>

      <p class="post-content"><strong>Agree with Wizard_cev</strong><br />
      My computer is not that fast either, however that doesn't stop me from creating good presets. I asjust them till they are perfect on my computer. But there are some effects that are very FPS sensitive (like the values in the Per Frame fields). For example: if I have t=t-0.5 (and t makes the, let's say, SS change position) in the Frame field and it looks great on my omputer, then the person with a computer that is x3 faster may see nothing but vexing jerking.<br />
      <br />
      Perhaps an FPS limiter could be in the Misk. You can use it in the preset if you want (like the BPM). You could set the FPS limit and that's all. Or it could me in the 'Main' under the clear every frame option. Turn it on if you like and set the limit.</p>
