I was thinking you could render part of it with the raytrace SSC and render part of it with plain SSCs (like the danger stripes) for higher detail. The only thing which seems wrong to me is the normal map for the left/right walls which seems to be too exaggerated. It looks wrong next to the flat danger stripes (or, you could try implementing parallax mapping *g*).<br><br>Also, I had another nifty idea for the adaptive sampling thingie... bump up the resolution to x2, but for pixels further away than a certain distance, set the odd pixels equal to the last pixel. If you wrap all the code in an if block, you should get a nice speed improvement without losing detail in the lighter areas.<br><br>Though what's up with that interface...?

      As far as the preset goes, I love techy presets. I'm a sucker for them so this one is great for me. I agree with unconed that you could fix some of the normal mapping to make it look a little bit better. Have to say I dont like that split on the walls very much... I think you were just trying to break it up with something but I dont think it looks good...<br>
      <br>
      There's something wrong with your stretching too... At certain screen sizes I get columns or rows that go black. Also, maybe you should make the resolution variable. I tried to fix your code a bit to make it the full resolution (used multiple scopes so it could be a larger size window too) but the different scopes got messed up which probably has to do with your time adjustments but I didn't feel like digging that far into it. I'd love to see this in full resolution!</p>
