Firstly we need to be aware that there is no inbuilt support for complex numbers. This is not a big issue though since each complex number can be represented by a pair of real numbers, and AVS does support these.<br><br>The basic operations can be done like this in maths and code:<br><br>Where w, z are complex numbers a + ib and c + id respectively:<br>w + z = a + ib + c + id = (a+c) + i(b+d)<br>w - z = a + ib - c - id = (a-c) + i(b-d)<br>assuming we have variables a, b, c and d containing our complex number components we can write this in code as:<br></p><pre>
<code><br>// addition<br>result_real = a + c;<br>result_complex = b + d;<br><br>// subtraction<br>result_real = a - c;<br>result_complex = b - d;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Multiplication is slightly more painful, we also consider the special case of squaring which is useful for generating the Mandelbrot set.<br>
      <br>
      wz = (a + ib)(c + id) = ac + iad + ibc - bd = (ac - bd) + i(ad + bc)<br>
      ww = (a + ib)(a + ib) = (aÂ² - bÂ²) + i(2ab)<br>
      <pre>
<code><br>// multiplication<br>result_real = a*c - b*d;<br>result_complex = a*d + b*c;<br><br>// square<br>result_real = sqr(a) - sqr(b);<br>result_complex = 2*a*b;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      If you want to optimise you can use result_complex = a*b; result_complex = result_complex + result_complex; I think it is marginally faster.<br>
      <br>
      Division is slightly more painful since we need to do some "algebraic juggling" to get the expression into a friendly form. We also need to make use of the idea of <i>complex conjugate</i> which is usually denoted with a "*" but sometimes with a bar over the top instead.<br>
      <br>
      w* = a - ib<br>
      <br>
      The conjugate has the property that w + w* and ww* are both real numbers:<br>
      w + w* = a + ib + a - ib = 2a<br>
      ww* = (a + ib)(a - ib) = aÂ² + bÂ²<br>
      <br>
      We use the latter property to simplify w/z :<br>
      <br>
      w/z = (a + ib)/(c + id)<br>
      w/z = wz*/zz* = (a + ib)(c - id)/(c + id)(c - id) = (ac + bd + i(bc - ad))/(cÂ² + dÂ²)<br>
      <br>
      This is quite hard to read so here is an image with nice formatting:<br>
      <a href="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8943/complexdivisionfs1.gif" target="_blank">http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8...ivisionfs1.gif</a><br>
      <br>
      <pre>
<code><br>// division<br>divopt = 1/(sqr(c) + sqr(d));<br>result_real = (a*c + b*d)*divopt;<br>result_complex = (b*c - a*d)*divopt;<br></code>
</pre><br>
      <br>
      Remember that divisions are very expensive relative to other arithmetic operations so we do it once and then use multiplication to apply it, rather than doing it twice.<br>
      <br>
      We can also define a function Abs which uses the conjugate:<br>
      Abs(w) = âˆš(ww*)<br>
      <br>
      Notice that if there are no complex components this is the same as taking the absolute value of a real number. This function also has a property if we look at the complex plane, it is the distance of a complex number from the origin.<br>
      <br>
      When iterating to generate the Mandelbrot set we are interested in those points which do not diverge. Lets use w_0 = 0, w_n+1 = (w_n)Â² + z to stick with our current convention for the complex numbers. I have again done the maths as an image since in text it is pretty horrible to make readable:<br>
      <a href="http://img177.imageshack.us/img177/8118/mandelbrotrealjv8.gif" target="_blank">http://img177.imageshack.us/img177/8...rotrealjv8.gif</a><br>
      <br>
      Now, if Abs(z) &gt; 2 the w_n are always going to diverge. There is a nice geometric argument for this based on the geometric properties of the complex number product. You can expand out the algebra above to check this, but Abs(z*w) = Abs(w)*Abs(z). At first glance it looks like z &gt; 1 is sufficient for divergence since the repeated squaring will always increase the distance from the origin. However we have to consider the z which is used to generate the w_n as well. Complex addition is geometrically like adding a little arrow to the point where our number is which is the arrow from the origin to the number we are adding with. With Abs(z) &gt; 2 the length of this arrow is greater than 2, but the length of the arrow from squaring is going to be Abs(z)*Abs(z) &gt; 2*Abs(z), i.e. more than twice as long. So no matter how we add the final arrow, we always end up further away from the origin in the second iteration than in first iteration.<br>
      <br>
      The same logic then applies to subsequent iterations.<br>
      <br>
      This is easier to understand with diagrams... but I am too lazy for that :p<br>
      <br>
      Hope this all helps. I think I included everything you should need to know.<br>
      <br>
      EDIT: Just noticed a typo in the complex division, it should be ac <b>+</b> bd and bc <b>-</b> ad, that came through in the .gif as well and I am too lazy to fix that. Just be aware of it. I copy pasted my multiplication without thinking hard enough. :)

      <p class="post-content">Well thanks for the two avs and the code.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Nanakiwurkz thanks for the help and not trying to be mean but the one you gave me was not realy a fractal if it was I could have put thos types of avs up a log time ago. No the color bar on the side is a nice trick I would have never thought about doing that.<br>
      <br>
      Jheriko thanks for the code I have not had a chance to look all the way through it. And agen not trying to be mean but I have only done one other AVS pack before this one and that was all the work I had aver done with avs.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Agen thanks to the both of you.</p>

      </blockquote>Not trying to be mean, but if you can't work it out from the code, the complex arithmetic i explained above, and the mandebrot set generator function then I will be totally out of ideas as to how to provide further help.<br>
      <br>
      The only other thing I could think of is that you might not understand what code does, in which case read PAK-9's AVS programming guide. It is an pretty thorough introduction to programming for AVS.<br>

      IFS stands for<br>
      "Iterrated Fractal System"<br>
      which technically renders a dot fractal in 3d.<br>
      there is 2 apes that render fractals.<br>
      one is called IFS and the other well nvr mind the other its crap to. but IFS is a true fractal system based on the Julia set. the reason it runs very well is because its just dots.<br>
      *note* "fractals are more then just pictures that repeat themselves infinte. you have more then one type of fractals.<br>
      my fav has to be the Sierpenski Curve fractal and IFS fractals."<br>
      <br>
      sorry if that sounded mean.

      Wikipedia has a pretty down to earth guide of how to implement the mandelbrot set: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#For_Programmers" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelb...or_Programmers</a><br>
      Keep in mind that writing loops in avs is a real pain, in order to write a conditional loop performing sevral tasks, you basicly need to write something like:<br></p>
      <pre>
<code>loop(somenumber, if(below(xx+yy,4),exec3(<br>    assign(something, tosomething)<br>  , assign(something, tosomething)<br>  , assign(something, tosomething)),0));</code>
</pre><br>
      Which as you can see, is really ugly. Therefore I encourage you to look up Tommylobos AVSTrans, if you are serious about implementing the mandelbrot fractal in AVS (most other iterative fractals are at least as tough to write).
