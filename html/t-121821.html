I played AVS for about 6 hours with 3-4 shutdowns. I played on a single monitor because I didnt have the cable to connect the projector via TV-out<br>(it's not very plesent if winamp shuts down in the midlle of the projection, even more so if you have only one monitor:D). At first I played under windows 98 because my sound controls in XP were still on the other monitor from the last projection:). But after a couple of sistem crashes I tried using my monitor as the secondary monitor to get the sound controls (which was all OK),but then I couldnt reach the display controls which were now on the other screen:D. So I had to get it back by randomly pulling from the other screen which is not easy. Then I noticed that the cursor comes back with the selection rectangle (when i missed the window) or without it ...and the point is XP is a lot beter because only winamp crashes:D.<br>Anyway I played a lot of presets, like I said at least one of everyone on my comp:)(2725 presets curently installed) and people loved them, some even said that those were the best visuals they ever saw:D YAY.What they liked the most is the fact the visuals reacted to music and they obviusly didnt mind the fact that all I could do is switch to next, previous and random:D.<br><br><br></p><blockquote>Im sorry - I really can't get excited by unmixed avs in a pub.

About that VJ part, I do it to get out every once in a while:) and free boze backstage is nice to:D. I do play my presets as well, there's just not enough of them for the whole night:). And yes I know there is a lot more to learn, there is allways a lot more to learn:).<br>What I cant understand is why were you there if you think it was borring, I mean there is a clear shot of you on picture 11 :D<br>(im sooo bad:D).<br><br>This has to be my lognest post I ever wrote, probably the most borring one as well:D.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaak</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">29th January 2003 19:20 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">YAY!<br>Good job, keep it up and say **** on minor (or major) difficulties!<br>HEH!
