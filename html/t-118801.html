      <p class="post-content"><strong>May I have your attention please... (next pack)</strong><br />
      I've decided that NDD4 will be a remix pack. You know what that means...<br />
      <br />
      Start tearing my presets apart!<br />
      <br />
      I've already got one that I'm definitely using (Zevensoft's 3D translation of Stick Disco).<br />
      <br />
      Here are links to my packs to save you the trouble of hunting them down:<br />
      <br />
      <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/419982" target="_blank">uNDefineD 0 - Brentyn</a><br />
      <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/415612" target="_blank">uNDefineD 1 - Explosion</a><br />
      <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/698782" target="_blank">uNDefineD 2 - Advantage</a><br />
      uNDefineD 3 - Radiance will be up VERY soon. 24 presets down.<br />
      <br />
      I just need you to stick to three teensy weensy rules:<br />
      <br />
      1. Name your remix like this: uNDefineD - presetname (yourname nameofremix RMX)<br />
      2. Add a comment above mine telling the date you did the remix and what you changed/added/whatever.<br />
      3. Post your remixes in this thread.<br />
      <br />
      As usual, I'm making the target 30 presets, plus an intro (that I'M doing :p). So you're welcome to submit more than one (just keep it reasonable, I think 3 is a decent limit). If activity slows down, then I'll open that limit a bit more. I'm going to be doing a remix or two as well.<br />
      <br />
      I look forward to seeing what you can come up with. :)</p>

      <br />
      BTW if anyone can figure out that bug I would be most appreciative. I have an updated version of the preset with a different morphing into the two planes... one which doesn't destroy the 3D effect of the tunnels in the process, but, there is no point in me posting it if the morphing is still broken.</p>

      I didn't remember how to name the presets so im sorry for that... not that it matters since the "remixes" don't have any names, just my name.<br />
      <br />
      Im also sorry for not remixing these properly (i think) and i completely understand if you don't want to put them into the pack, because 2 presets are just slight edit's and 1 preset is just completely done from scratch without using any of your stuff :(</p>

      Gandalf's Vision - Also nice. Love the flowing (although it kinda hides the beat detection). Adding an on-beat brightness might work well for this.<br />

      Thanks. :) At this point, I'm really just going to use anything, because there's still lots of room to fill. And don't worry about the name thing, that was only to save me from naming them all the same myself. So I'm a total obsessive, AND I'm a lazy bugger. :D<br />
      <br />
      Anyway:<br />
      <br />
      - Black Hole Flipside is awesome, especially the scopes (Why didn't I think of that?).<br />
      - Hmm, Gandalf's vision didn't shift around in the movie, but it's still pretty cool.<br />
      - Mercury Ocean: yes, it's definitely staying in. :) Only prob is that the ocean itself is a little too dark.<br />
      <br />
      So, the count so far is:<br />
      Me - 1 (I remixed Static void from NDD1, don't know what else to do)<br />
      jheriko - 1<br />
      Zevensoft - 1<br />
      Tuggummi - 3<br />
      Total - 6<br />
      <br />
      Jheriko--<br />
      Thanks too. Didn't really notice that much of a problem, but anyway.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok here are the slightly uptaded versions. Although you probably won't even notice that they are uptaded, but they are. Even Gandalf's Vision is a bit different (removed the green starfield :p)<br />
      <br />
      Anyway i hope they are now better, and if they need slight adjustments i trust uNDefineD to make the changes :)<br />

      <br />
      == (copied this from the intro to the pack which is finished) ==<br />
      <br />
      I'm going to make a series of small packs with a specific "theme" to them, maybe 10 presets each, like a miniseries. I've already got a few ideas lined up. I'm going to take a break for a month or three after that, then I'm going to start REALLY researching the techy stuff. Using those skills, I'll start work on the next pack: uNDefineD 5 - Immersion.<br />
      <br />

      BTW: I am gonna do Just The Basics next, I wasn't joking.</p>

      Wow, pretty damn cool. Can't say I agree with the colour scheme for the ship though. :p But anyway, as much as I hate to say it: no more from you. (Sounds way more negative than it really is, doesn't it? :))<br />
      <br />
      Dragon--<br />
      Personally I'd stop at 30 or so, but whatever floats your boat. You've still got 2 spaces left, which will bring us up to <b>25</b>. I look forward to seeing what you can come up with again.<br />
      <br />
      BTW--<br />
      Just an update on the MiniPak series: the packs will consist of 10 presets each with an intro. I'll finish them all at once then release them at 2 week intervals. The packs are:<br /></p>

      <ul>
        <li>1 - Fast (hi-res stuff)</li>

        <li>2 - Renderless (obvious)</li>

        <li>3 - Black and White (also obvious)</li>

        <li>4 - Remixes (my remixes of others, I'll be compiling my request list soon)</li>

        <li>5 - Windows MP (WMP visualisations converted into AVS)</li>
      </ul><br />
      And Tuggummi, just in case you're wondering, the James Taylor pack was dropped. I just couldn't remember all of them, and they weren't turning out as well as I'd hoped.<br />
      <br />
      4 out of 50 presets down. It's gonna rock!<br />

      <p class="post-content">i dont even know, im not 100% satisfied with any of them. My skills have not yet developed enough. Im such a lazy perfectionist it drives me insane. meh im still studying DMs so i can turn my perception into something similar to unconeds zero g maze and complex scopes so i can basically make nice presets. Go ahead use that movement im not using it in my pack it dosent have enough expansion possibilities for my liking just some credit and go nuts :D :up:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yeah, I figured I'd keep it kinda n00bish. If I didn't, then it would have been an entirely different preset. I did replace the interference with some colored SSC's and a DM, to make it a bit more controllable.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It's a fantastic anime about a girl who had a friend commit suicide, and through that she discovers how closely the real world and the "wired" world (read: uber-Internet) are linked. Very confusing.<br />
