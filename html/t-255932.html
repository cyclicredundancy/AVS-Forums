I made the oscilloscope orb, and decided to make a core to go along. I made a background that was origionaly a plain, but then I decided that If the orb were rushing through a tunnel, It would look 20x better. I just didn't know how to raytrace a tunnel so I looked at a tunnel by UnconeD, simplified it and put it in my preset with my own texture and everything else.
