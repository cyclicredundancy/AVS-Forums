What are the picks usually? Bunch random colection... Well my idea is to make a whole community pack, contains one theme. For example - japaneese theme (look out for AVSociety's last minipak), or something else... Ofcouse that would be pain in ass for us in comparison with random picks, but that would be more cooler. So let's discuss what theme can be used.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">13th May 2004 20:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't think choosing a theme is a good idea.

Well, it really differs from the community pics, cause in case picks = 20 Skupers' presets, 20 Tuggs presets, etc... and only the rest of them will be from other artists... So themed pack would completely fix that (nobody will make arond 10 presets with one theme, agree with me)... And then all the community can make somthing, not just most famous artists. Genres? Hmm... Everyone is listening what he like, isnt it ;) ?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Too-DAMN-Much</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2004 07:54 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">sounds ok, most of the big ones can be lopsided, and it would give people who haven't really gotten exposure a chance to breakup the (starting line-up)......</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2004 07:59 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Well i've said this before and i will say it again: It's your own damn fault if you can't select for a community pack other than unconed or skupers :hang:</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Yathosho</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2004 09:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote><i>Originally posted by Tuggummi</i><br><b>Well i've said this before and i will say it again: It's your own damn fault if you can't select for a community pack other than unconed or skupers :hang:</b></blockquote>/me agrees</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">vanish the dude</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th May 2004 14:11 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Dammit Tugg :mad: , i'm not saying that i don't like that YOU or UCD are in picks, i said that there are <b>damn alot of talented artists</b> and we just will give them a chance...

No themes, no restrictions on how many from each artist, no other obfuscations..<br><br>all that matters is how many people think it's a leet preset. You think some preset is one of the best, and it doesnt get voted in, then it is because people disagree with you, not because its not a preset by UnConeD or skupers or tuggummi or what-the-fucking-ever.<br><br>Besides, from what we have seen so far, there is lots of other people's in there, degnic, shock-value, el-vis, fsk, zamuz etc.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
