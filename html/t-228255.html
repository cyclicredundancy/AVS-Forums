      <p class="post-content">:| this will be serious fun... anyway, so, to make things clear, Brian has no visuals. maybe his car had some but i can not fucking remember so try to describe that effect.</p>

      <p class="post-content">I think hboy wasn't asking <b>where</b> that visualization was playing but more <b>how</b> that specific visualization looked like. Cause at first not everyone in the world has seen that movie and secondly not everyone who actually HAS seen that movie can remember how that certain visualization looked like. So you have to describe it to us in order to get an answer.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Not too many people have the skill to make something as complex as that and im not sure the ones who can will go for it at all, so basicly you're pretty much screwed (you can always ask nicely though, or bribe someone to do it)</p>

      <p class="post-content">That remindes me a little of UnConeD's "Goldie". That was in a pack called "Community Picks". It's not very much like what's in that screenshot, but it's still pretty cool...<br />
      <br />
      With the right motivation (as in a hefty bribe), I probably could make a preset that looks like that screenshot, but, having not seen that movie, I can't guarantee that I'll get the motion (or anything else) quite right. At least it'd be an opportunity to practice with "Render / Triangle" some more!</p>

      <p class="post-content">that shit? oh man. i remember the movie (sucked bigtime), but that thing i didn't even remember until you showed it. i guess you just can forget about seeing that one...way too boring. as stated above: go for "goldie" from unconed. waaaaaaay better looking.</p>

      <p class="post-content">It wouldnt be a particularily big deal to make a preset like this provided you are fairly competent with triangle ape. It is always rendered from the same direction so you could forgoe the z-buffer and just draw from back to front. However it wouldnt produce a particularily interesting or exciting visualisation so I wouldnt really recommend anyone bother.</p>
