      <p class="post-content">except that they are only 3 presets...<br />

      do you want some feedback or is it just to show that you're still working on avs? :confused:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Dear Matt,<br />
      <br />
      First and foremost, these suck.<br />
      A single SSC is not a preset.<br />
      Secondly, as ^..^ said, there's only three.<br />
      Now I'm not saying that there's absolutely no hope for you,<br />
      but why not quit while you're ahead?<br />
      If you must continue, you really ought to work on<br />
      adding even a little bit of visual decency.<br />
      <br />
      Hope this helps,<br />

      <p class="post-content">okay...i know matt's an ass, and i want him to go away as much as anyone else (mainly because of his unmitigated stupidity). that having been said, you are a total fucking cunt. avs is already dying, we don't need you flaming people on account of their artistic efforts, no matter how bad you think they are. i don't really give a damn about flaming, unless it's the kind of cold bullshit you just pulled. if i were you, i wouldn't be educating other people on the concept of "decency" - and i shouldn't have to tell you that your opinions don't have nearly enough clout on this forum for you to form them the way that you did.<br />
      <br />
      so don't fucking do it again, prick. :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">To Matt and Atero:<br />
      For whatever it may be worth, I apologize for my complete lack of morality. At the time I had not taken notice of how thoughtless the intent had been. I have no excuse for my actions, but I promise that in the future I will be much more careful in what I say.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well, I truthfully don't mean any real harm to anyone. At the time I had just thought it to be funny, but looking back it really was a cold and deceitful thing to say. Matt, I hope you can forgive my heartless actions, but if not I'll certainly understand.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Okay, matt, I will not say you're the worst idiot i've ever met.<br />
      I will not say these presets are the worst I've ever seen, and will not say that you should quit AVS'ing.<br />
      <br />
      But I am going to say that all other members on this forum are a lot furhter advanced than you are and that you have no right to dictate them, rather listen to advice instead of always choosing the defence.<br />
      I repeat, listen to advice. Especially about things that have been mentioned before.<br />
      <br />
      About the presets: You've advanced but I sure won't be adding these to my permanent list. They're just not attractive.<br />
      Try fiddling around with movements too, instead of just rendering (i.e. quickie).<br />
      And a missing bitmap after even a second release.. now, that's bad :(<br />
      <br />
      and oh yea, a little offtopic but your artist name is neither in the presetname nor in the comment (as there is none). You might want to add that too.</p>

      <br />
