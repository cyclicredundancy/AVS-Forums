Some scenes change quite fast (1 sec changes) which is quite effective and some stretch out for longer... hmmm... perhaps a manual change setting with some unique transitions?<br><br>I kind of like the transitions in R2E although you'd need open GL to power them.<br><br>ADDITIONAL EFFECTS - YESS!</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">18th November 2003 10:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I thought of something like additional filters or movements which you can control in shape and intesity directly through the hotlist interface.<br><br>I'll probably end up writing a control-&gt;regXX ape. So you can set your reg values by using trackbars to control whatever you like. 10 values should be enough I think.<br><br>Shouldnt be too hard to do this, but i guess this will be something for v2.4<br><br>Technically, i'll have to do it the following way:<br><br>-Ape sends message to Hotlist, submitting information about this value (to set by the user as a reminder e.g. "x-axis rotation") and requesting a value<br>-Hotlists displays the information and sends back the requested value.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">fsk</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">19th November 2003 14:17 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>fast remote text display could also be cool</blockquote>YES,this would kick ass. I realy like puting text on and the current way of doing it is cumbersome to say the least.<br><br>which remindes me:<br>this friday I had a gig in the biggest club in slovenia and I made a big pupu out of it:D. Didnt eat during the day because I was buisy and forgot. then during the projecting i drank cca.2dl of vodka and experienced a power failor in my head:D. all in all i played about 3 presets and put on the text 'i will fuck you all'. I then proceded with blacikng out and leaving the screen blank. When i came to eveyone was pissed off and i couldnt figure out why because i dont remember a damn thing. I got banned from the club and got laughed at on a local techno forum:D.<br>I also heard that i was danceing with my keyboard (which is missing about ten buttons and the connector) and tried to throw my monitor on the dance flor. Luckaly i was stoped by someone. The leason here is dont drink on an empty stomach or even better dont drink when on a job(even if you get a lousy salory):).</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Montana</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">19th November 2003 20:02 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">ummmh, fsk, ummmh, lol</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Magic.X</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th November 2003 08:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Fsk, you didn't attend the "how do i promote myself" course did you? :p<br><br>For myself, i made up 3 rules:<br><br>Rule #1:<br>No Drugs when i'm in charge of something at a Party!<br><br>Rule #2:<br>Don't even think about bending rule #1 in any fucking way!!!<br><br>Rule #3:<br>If rule #1 and #2 and seem to fail, set yourself a limit so you're still able to act professionally.<br><br>It worked fine until now.

Nevertheless, this was also the first time that i really got paid - 150€ including gas so after all there's still 100€ left for my A64 :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">legohead</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th November 2003 09:44 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">FSK - YOU ROCK!<br><br>hey man you can't tell me that iggy pop was made a super star for sticking to softdrink all night aye? :P<br><br>Then again... who the fuck wants to be iggy pop...</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">S-uper_T-oast</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2003 02:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice job Magic, making a 100 off of one night, whenever I VJ I always seem to end up with less money then when I started, and I am usually getting paid too, hummmm, maybe it is just me.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st November 2003 09:32 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">One tip, S-uper_T-oast, drink less expensive drinks ;).
