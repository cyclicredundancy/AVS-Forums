      <p class="post-content">hey, what's up with all the hate?!? I know I've been gone for a while from the AVS forum for a while, and I may be gone some more, but give the poor guy a break. He's just a n00b, and weren't we all there once?<br />
      <br />
      You should look at the FAQ, or if you did, say that you looked at it but couldn't figure out the answer for your exact question. To turn off the random preset picking, just type "r" with the main AVS window open. For a guide, forum search should help. The subject "AVS Primer" comes to mind. There's been several other AVS guide webpages put out by some users. I don't have a webpage, but as soon as I get my other computer back, I'll post a small section of my guide. I admit I'm a very slow writer, and I am easily distracted. So my guide (anyone remember when I first mentioned I was working on it?) is taking a very long time to complete because I don't work on it for very long at a time, and I don't work on it often. But it's a help, right?</p>

      <p class="post-content">Just for the forum's information: The second paragraph was written for Berghutze. I forgot to address him, so it probably sounded a little weird talking to some of the people who wrote replies to this thread and suddenly start talking with the starter or the thread.<br />
      <br />
      I thought UnConeD's comment was pretty funny.<br />
      <br />
      Berghutze: Just FYI---Atero is the guy who wrote the thing I mentioned called "AVS Primer." It's an AVS guide that covers each element of AVS. To get a general understanding of what goes into making a preset, it's a very good idea to take a look at that. (hint hint).</p>

      <p class="post-content">It indeed gets a little annoying reading the same questions over and over and over (etc.) again. But what I notice is that it happens a lot that newbies just look over the FAQ-section and jump into the forums. Perhaps (webmasters, listen up) that could be mentioned in the signing up...</p>

      I solved the problem myself; i reinstalled winamp3.<br />

      <p class="post-content">Ahhhh! I see we had a miscommunication! If you'd told us up front that you'd looked in the FAQ and it couldn't solve your problem, there probably would never have been all the derogatory comments that you got.<br />
      <br />
      If we know you did your homework before asking your question, we almost always are happy to help you with any problem. As long as you tell us what you've done to try and find the answer, this won't happen.<br />
      <br />
      Feel free to ask questions! We like answering questions, but we worked hard to put together the various guides for AVS, and we like to know that people are looking at them.</p>

      Berghutze: A lot of people come though here and ask a question the is in the FAQ. At first glance, your question looks like question #9 in the FAQ, hence the flames.<br />
      <br />
      The problem you describe is a winamp 3 AVS thing. I don't know how to solve it. Perhaps double clicking the AVS window will work. That's another way to close the editor.<br />

      - A crappy component for reading old DSP/General WA2 plug-ins, which was quickly removed.<br />
      - When a bug in my APE caused Winamp3 to crash and corrupted its DB (but removing the DB dir fixed this).<br />

      <p class="post-content">The only reason I use WA3 is for its video-playing capabilities. Media Player has an awful way of handling playlists (have to add the videos to the media library first, then make a new playlist). In Winamp3, you just drag em into the list, useful for multi-part videos and such.</p>

      <p class="post-content">WMP doesn't auto hide the mouse on fullscreen like WA3 either.<br />
      <br />
      WMP is a perfect example of how *not* to make a media player. It has awkward functionality which is crap, you need to know more than an asm programmer to make a crappy visualisation for it and you need to slave away for several years to produce a skin for it. As if that wasn't bad enough it has awful error handling and has tons of missing or limited features.<br />
      <br />
      In short - I hate WMP because it sucks pig testicles.<br />
