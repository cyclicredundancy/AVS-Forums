My question is do I need to get permission from everyone who's stuff I used before I can release these. The thing is these are not just minor changes, in every case I have mixed at least 3 presets together and radicaly changed each of those presets, so the end results are extremely different then the individual presets I started with.<br><br>Of course I plan to give all of the original AVSers credit in the readme and in comments as well as list which presets went into which remixes. But there is like more than 20 people I would need to get premission from if I need to get permission from them all. I have often seen remixes that were only minor alterations, and that I am sure no permission was given for, that have been up on the main winamp site.<br><br>Finaly, I really want to release these only because they are SICK!! I gaze in fear and awe at the deeply twisted things I have aranged in these remixes. Oh man...:igor: I can not begin to describe what I have done and I can only say that there is no way I could have made the presets I started with so I am deeply gratefull for the wonderful work that so many have done. That said, I have rearanged these presets in ways that I think may surprise and amaze you. I don't even want credit for these at all really, I just think it would be a shame not to share them. :p</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Deamon</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 10:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">I don't know any people around here who will bother if you publish remixes of his/hers work as long as you leave some credit that the original is made by him/her.

I have quite a few that are done but there are a couple that I still need to finish before I release them. I am pretty busy for the next couple weeks so I only get to work on them a little at a time. I will try to get them all packaged up and released soon though - maybe a week or two.<br><br>Thanks guys. Oh and Tuggummi, I have used some of your stuff in several of these remixes so I'll take this oportunity to thank you personaly for some brilliant visuals - I love your work. When I release these I hope you will take a look at them.<br><br>Man I really got sucked into this stuff. I started messing with the settings in AVS and like 12 hours later, mind realing, vision blurring, I stare in awe at what is going on before my eyes. Hardly able to believe that this imagery has emerged from what I started with. That was just the first one and the remixes I have done since then are on a different level so that first one won't even be in the release. It's CRAZY. Hats off to you people that make these presets from scratch though, I would not even know where to begin if it weren't for you guys.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Tuggummi</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">8th October 2003 11:18 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"></p><blockquote>Thanks guys.
