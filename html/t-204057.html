By doing the rotation first you are rotating the world then shifting its position. The 'camera cordinates' could be got back by rotating the 0,0,-2 vector backwards I suppose... but thats expensive.<br><br>When using 'camera code' the idea is to take this method and expand on it a bit. Basically you take the camera coords ox,oy,oz and shift the whole world by them, like x1=x1-ox;y1=y1-oy;z1=z1-oz; then you rotate by the angles you want *the camera* to rotate by, remember that to start with it is looking down the +ve z axis (assuming you are clipping the negative values... otherwise you get ugly line bugs). In essence you are shifting the world and rotating it around the 'camera' to achieve the effect. When doing the final xyz-&gt;xy transform you no longer need to shift the z axis since we have already set up a fake camera to setup our viewpoint. all we need to do is x=x1/z1;y=y/z1; or even better (faster) z1=1/z1;x=x1*z1;y=y1*z1; using a camera like this you can move to any point in the world and look in any direction without having to do much head scratching. The problem comes when you want to use 'look at' code, which can often cause gimbal lock if used badly. There are advantages and disadvantages to either method, the main advantage of using a camera is that you can synchronise lots of different types of 3d things together easily.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaak</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th January 2005 18:05 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">your rotation seems fine to me, i think some ppl call that "distortion" perspective<br><br>if you use tiny bit of logic, then you could relize that what greater the distance is, the smaller the object you look is. So, you have to use distance from object to camera to set the size of each particle. Just use the z value<br><br>meh, if you want to move the oject in 3D space, then you have to do it before rotation, if you do it after rotation, you just move the picture to left/right or size it (z value).

Lets say that we do this by finding points that are a set distance away from the circle's centre. we would need something like (over simple):<br><br>d1=sqrt(sqr(x-px1)+sqr(y-py1));<br>d2=sqrt(sqr(x-px2)+sqr(y-py2));<br>d3=...<br>d=bor(below(d1,.1),below(d2,.1))+bor(below...<br><br>where px1,py1 px2,py2 etc... are the centres of the blobs, and we draw whereever d=1<br><br>the problem with this is that no blobbing happens. we need to take into account the distances to all of the centrepoints when working out if we draw a point or not since if two blobs are near then our point may be in neither circle but could be in the blobby mass that joins them. for this reason we need to combine d1 d2 etc to create the metablob effect.<br><br>because the distance gets smaller nearer the centre its not the best way to define the boundaries of the system of blobs since we are interested in how close we are to the centres to work out the blobbing, not how far away they are. what might be better is to use 1/d1 1/d2 etc since they are higher at the centre. so we do:<br><br>d1=1/sqrt(sqr(x-px1)+sqr(y-py1));<br>d2=1/sqrt(sqr(x-px2)+sqr(y-py2));<br>d3=...<br>d=above(d1+d2+d3...,10);<br><br>this creates a metablob effect, its not perfect though.<br><br>in a simple system with d1 d2 based on p1x/y p2x/y and d=d1+d2 we can se that if we use above(d1+d2,10) then when p1 and p2 meet the blob doesn't increase in size correctly since for a single blob d1 (or d2) = 10 if the distance to p1 (or p2) is equal to .1 since 1/.1 = 10, but for the two blobs together on the same spot 2/.2 = 10, but our radius has doubled! which means that our area has grown by 4 instead of 2! to fix this we do:<br><br>d1=1/(sqr(x-px1)+sqr(y-py1));<br>d2=1/(sqr(x-px2)+sqr(y-py2));<br>d3=...<br>d=above(d1+d2+d3...,100);<br><br>then 1/sqr(.1) = 100 and 2/sqr(sqrt(.2)) = 100 and we have the correct new radius of sqrt(.2) for a joined blob</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">^..^</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th January 2005 12:06 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">many thanks!!<br>i won't understand everything straight off, but i'll proceed step by step...<br><br>ok. let me repeat your explanation with my own words.
