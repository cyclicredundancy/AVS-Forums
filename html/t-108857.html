What we do is that, one by one, everybody gets to add ONE ITEM to the preset. Rules are as follows:<br><br>1: You must sign in with the date on the preset.<br>2: The first person chooses what kind of preset is to be made, i.e. if the name of the preset is called "Llama shit" you'd have to make a preset that looks like llama shit...no really llamas do shit.<br>3: ONE ITEM PER PERSON! AND SIGN THIS ON THE COMMENTS!<br>4: You may suggest items to be added.<br>5: Let UnConeD or somebody do the superscopes, we'd like high quality.:) (J/k if you can make the superscope look good with the preset then go ahead.<br>6: Multiples of the same item is allowed, just make sure that they are exact same (i.e. you can't make 2 yellow fireworks and 2 white fireworks and say they are duplicates)<br>7: E-mail it to the next person in line, DO NOT POST HERE.<br><br>Good idea?

We @ devart are already doing this and the system works quite well. Each member makes a new preset or remixes someone elses preset and gives it back to the "pool" where each member can either take a new preset to remix or send a new preset into it. After someone thinks a preset is finished and no one should add anything to it anymore. It is sended to the organizer of it and that's it. One preset finished.<br><br><br><br><br>Uhm... damn my english is bad :weird: :hang:<br><br>Anyway, just to say that it's not a new idea, but a good one nevertheless. And if Unconed participates... well one man can make a difference, but i hope the rest of the team is as good as him :D</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Xion(810)</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">9th October 2002 02:01 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Coned: It won't be hard to control, I remember doing something like this before and it worked pretty smooth. Too much anticipation though, that's the only problem. People bitch too much about somebody taking too much time.<br><br>Karnov: That's why we have the comments. Everybody signs in there and people can see who remixed what. And you're in? Cool.<br><br>jheriko: It's okay if somebody does drop a large superscope in, as long as it goes along with the preset.<br><br>Jaheck: I may be stuck with the cleanup, unless somebody voulnteers.<br><br>Atero: If it works with the preset, okay! Just as long as it looks nice. Nothing where you can just drop it in and say "Done" without changing anything else. :)<br><br>Zeven: Why you say that? :( It may be a mess, and if it is, I promise to have this not be done again.<br><br>Tugg: The difference between your way of this idea and my way of the idea is that we have a list. you just have a "Smash and Grab" premise.<br><br>Please voulnteer for this, and if you do, please send me a PM with your E-mail address.
