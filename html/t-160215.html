How can I speed it up?<br><br>The answer is simple: you can't. AVS only uses your CPU, so having a fast 3D graphics card won't help much. Here are some tips in speeding it up:<br><br>- Run in 32-bit mode. This might sound weird, but 32-bit color depth is a lot faster than 16-bit in AVS. This is because everything is calculated at 32-bit internally, so any other mode requires the image to be converted each frame.<br><br>- Run in a low resolution. If your video-card doesn't support resolutions like 320x240 or 400x300 at 32-bit, you can use pixel-doubling. This effectively halves the actual resolution (e.g. 640x480 pixel-doubled is the same as 320x240).<br><br>- Turn off any other programs or background processes that are running.<br><br><br>For more in-depth discussions on the hardware acceleration issue, check the following topics:<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=87279" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=87279</a><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=70823" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=70823</a><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=77753" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=77753</a><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=66004" target="_blank">http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=66004</a></blockquote>None of the threads discuss why they still do not use hardware acceleration.. and people that bumped them got yelled at.<br><br>Sorry for being new to the AVS forum :down::mad::down:</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2003 08:49 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Okay, here's a short answer:<br><br>Due to the high variability (and with that the many variables) of AVS, hardware acceleration ain't gonna help much, perhaps even slow things down.<br><br>That enough?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Jaak</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2003 12:47 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hardware acceleration will help very much... but Nullsoft (read: Justin ONLY) got better things to work on like called winamp5.<br>AVS is mainly coded by Justin... i know ppl who probably would help him to code avs for free, but thats very different thing</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Warrior of the Light</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2003 13:04 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">What you mean is totally reconstructing AVS for HW rendering.

BUT you need to keep in mind it WOULD be much faster if it was hardware accelerated. The GPU is a highly piplined seperate processer. By offloading this task off to the second processer it will speed up alone by having full use of it (instead of being switched in and out like it would on the cpu).<br><br>Also the cpu is at a lack of instructions to really do anything of this sorts quickly. Something could take up to 5 instructions being done on the cpu when it would only take 1 or 2 on the GPU.<br><br>I think the reason there is now hardware acceleration is because justin is too lazy to do a rewrite of avs and a pixel shader to go with it. I just think its stupid for them to keep working with it putting in features that no one will ever really be able to use.</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">UnConeD</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2003 14:48 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">cybaix: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=159933" target="_blank">this thread</a> sums it up nicely.<br><br>Thread closed.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
