With your next preset you'll start to see where you should add, and where you should hold back.<br><br>I was trolling through the forums the other day and came across a preset that had me twitching on the floor.<br><br>Your preset has style and definitely doesn't leave me spastic on the floor, so that's something right?</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Hydroxide76</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">15th December 2004 22:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Oh yes yes, I know what you're heading to, Nolita.<br><br>Responding to what you said, this is I believe the 36th of 42 OTHER presets I submitted. In a way I did what you said and "built up" with my newfound experience. I did grow from this and that's why I decided to make 41 more presets in hoping to improve a bit more.<br><br>Hell, I do this so I can teach myself to think outside the box anyway (I'm taking an algebra class this year). :)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nolita</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th December 2004 18:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Cool, what are you in middle or high school? That's not a dis, I'm just curious, since I took algebra in middle school but know that some folks take it as late as believe it or not, college, you seem way too bright to have to wait for college to study algebra.<br><br>Anyway, I just want to remind you that algebra will help, but AVS math still isn't what I would consider real algebra. There are tons of expressions in AVS that work really well, and even much better than a "real" algebreic(forgive the misspelling please) equation/expression would. Also if you took some of the best code from AVS to an algebra teacher they would probably look at you funny because to them it would seem completely illogical.<br><br>Still I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with algebra. I'm saying this because for me, algebra was way more fun than any of the math classes I took before it. I think it's because suddenly the numbers are representing things other than just numbers.<br><br>For myself anyway, it was awesome. Suddenly x equalled 2 and I could visualize 2 x's, and so on and so forth. It was much easier for me to wrap my brain around because I'm more of a visual thinker. To the point where prior to taking algebra I had to draw shapes to represent the numbers I was working with, and also, word problems were super easy for me because I could visualize things with a word problem. So when I took the placement test for my classes in the first year of middle school, I naturally answerred algebra questions correctly(almost a fluke really).<br><br>Long post cut only slightly shorter, good luck to you(though you don't need it:)).<br><br>BTW, get yourself some graph paper. I'm sure if you tell them it's for math(AVS math but math just the same) your folks will get some for you(unless of course you allready have some or get an allowance). The pad of graph paper I have has the perfect name, "layout paper" but different manufacturers give it different names. Just look for graph, or gridded paper.<br><br>Here's why, since the grid in AVS is invisible, it can be difficult to visualize a shape or even movement in your mind alone. The graph paper automatically has points(where each line intersects) and you can simply name them appropriately, thus getting the shapes and movements you want. I'm still learning though, so I can definitely tell you, it won't write your code for you, but it will help you to see how your code needs to be written.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Hydroxide76</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">16th December 2004 20:41 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thanks for the advice there. Haven't really been treated with advice lately so it's good to know someone out there is listening. Matter of fact we are required to be supplied with graph paper in my class, or it's a number of points off our overall grade. Not suprisingly, half of my supply is already in the recycling bin since I started AVS. Coincidence? I think not. :)<br><br>As far I go, I'm in freshman year in high-school, discluding the fact that I started slow during the middle school days (I took pre-al twice). A bit behind the crowd, you might say, since I still get hungry when I think of pi...<br><br>Anyway, I greatly appreciate the comments. My pack is due soon, so make sure you d/l it for yourself. :D<br><br>btw Nolita, I tried to d/l your 3D pack (from your 1st week and already 3D forum) the other day, but it just came up as an unknown file that contained nothing in it.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nolita</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2004 10:46 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Weird. I'll try posting it here in an attatchment:). Anyway it's not really what you would call 3D. I mean it's not true 3D even in the cg sense which is actually 2D posing as 3D.<br><br>Anyhow, I like them. They aren't terrific, but I just wanted to see if I could make anything straight out the gate.<br><br><br>I just wanted to make sure the attatchment would upload before I added that I'm not looking at you as behind the pack for not taking algebra sooner. You seem to be smart enough(was going to say intelligent but it seemed way too swellegant for me), and also you seem to be rather mature, but then I might just think that because a certain someone who shall remain nameless was being so immature for so long that you seem like a wise old sage in comparison. Either version is good, believe me.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Hydroxide76</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2004 22:22 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Ah! There we go. Well, there was nothing wrong with the file at all. I just had to replace the end with .zip in order to properly unzip it. ...Well then. Somewhere in the background you can faintly hear <font size="1"><b><i>"dammit, you're an idiot!"</i></b></font><br><br>I like them. A lot. Some of them could use a little work (primarily just colors), but overall it's 4.5/5 . I tip my hat off to "Nolita's_Illusion_of_3D_Filligree." People used the technique before of course, but hey, noone ever touched the Triangle effect in theirs. Did you write the Triangle APE yourself? If you did, then by all means allow me to kneel before you and kiss your shoes, you crazy-ass freak :) . Honestly that's the funniest thing I heard today, was "I can't code." I say there's 'professional' written all over it, no shit about it.<br><br>I have a little fake-3D preset I made myself, but I'm still working on it. I was going to add it into my next pack, but what the hell. Give me a few and I'll post it to the public.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Hydroxide76</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">17th December 2004 23:50 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Here we are.

Just don't expect an opinion too soon. I'm working on a non-avs project that I have given a self-imposed "by Christmas" deadline for. It's going to be a Christmas gift for my friends and aquaintances online who are going through those not-so-merry x-mas blues:(</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">mysterious_w</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">20th December 2004 09:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Nice fake semi-tunnel effect there.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Nolita</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th December 2004 06:31 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Hey, I finally got around to checking out solar hiker. Very, very nice indeed. I like how it sort of shifts from tunnelling to looking like you're moving up, almost flying up the side of a building.<br><br>It struck me that maybe you didn't read in my noob presets post, but I totally give credit for borrowed elements. One of the things to check is the comments section of a preset. It's particularly important because that's where folks give credit to those who they've borrowed and or learned from...also a way to give shouts out, and dedications.<br><br>When I did "I can't code" it wasn't a joke, beyond the fact that well, I can't. I'm still stumbling away, trying to make 100% original code. I know I can do it, I just have to keep plugging away at it. Since I'm not particularly fluent(not fluent at all actually) in any computer languages, beyond html, and dos, this is taking me awhile.<br><br>Anyway, I'm working on making a convincing 3D underwater scene. I've seen some which were really ugly(to my eyes), and I want to make one I find aesthetically pleasing. One of Pak-9's presets has what looks like hair waving in water. I'm not going to copy it, I just know that it's a good hint as to how to make the plants(the plan is to make each plant's stem wave to the beat, and have each stem as a single superscope, but for the leaves of each plant to all fall into a single ssc), it's going to take a really long time just to get the plants right.<br><br>I have figured out how to user texer2 to make the lovely translucent bubbles, so at least that's something.<br><br>Anyway, I just thought I'd tell you all that so you would understand why you definitely won't be seeing anything great from me in a really long time...I'm sure the proper way to make the ssc's will come to me in sort of an epiphany.<br><br>Again I really like solar hiker, and keep up the good work(somebody has to:)). I'm just trying to wrap my brain around per point and megabuffs, and registers right now:).</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">[Ishan]</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th December 2004 15:23 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">man! you people make looooooooong posts :p nice preset you posted in the first place hydroxide.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
