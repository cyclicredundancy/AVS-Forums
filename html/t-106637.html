I've got about four more presets to finish off then its done.<br><br>Anyway, I was hoping that some of you wonderful people might want to remix some of my work so that I can pick the best ones and cram them in my pack to size it up a bit and generally make it better. I always like packs with remixes in and I would like my pack even more if it contained remixes. Besides, I think that it is a good thing to do in the community.<br><br>Secondly, I would like to know if I can do some remixes of your work too. I'm not sure who's stuff I want to fiddle with yet but I will ask the orignal authors permission to include them in my pack when I make some.<br><br>You can get all of my presets from <a href="http://jheriko.deviantart.com" target="_blank">http://jheriko.deviantart.com</a> if you want to make some remixes for me. Hopefully you won't think that any of them are too noobish, I've always tryed to be code heavy, even in my earlier presets.<br><br>If you do make anything please post it up under this thread.<br><br>Thank you in advance.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Zevensoft</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd September 2002 14:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Here be a double-fps version of ya glass cube.<br><br>I also optimized the SSC's by reducing them to only ONE division per point, and only calculating sin and cos once per frame.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">23rd September 2002 15:34 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">Thankyou Zevensoft.<br><br>Here are some of my unreleased presets that will be in Pack VI, I basically chose four at random.

I love the AVS community, and now it is starting to love me back.<br><br>I couldn't be bothered to remix cubism in the end because the code was completely different to how i would usually do things, I would have had to remake the preset from scratch to do what I wanted to do, which really negates the point of remixes.
