I was on 5.24 which no longer works at all on my pc. Did a clean install of 5.31, then a clean reinstall of 5.24 again when the weirdness became apparent (still refused to work at all). Then another clean install of 5.31.<br><br>Now the weirdness. The 'alphaout' expression in effect lists seems to only work as 'alphaou' now. And half of PAK-9 AVS 5 is fucked up for reasons that are beyond me. It seems to only affect the newer more complicated features so that particular pack is the most obviously affected that i have.

If you write sufficiently terrible code they can make a very noticeable change. :)<br><br>It also depends on the structure of the program. "Whole program optimisation" has a larger impact if your project has hundreds of small seperate files, for instance. Inline expansion only has an effect if you aren't already using inline where appropriate or using classes with inline definitions. etc...<br><br>I think I have access to the cvs through sourceforge, I seem to remember accessing it once, but my computer is in shambles atm.
