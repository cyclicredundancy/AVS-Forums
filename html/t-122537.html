      <p class="post-content"><strong>Brian's Brain automata</strong><br />
      If you saw TFF2.0, you'll remember Life and Life (Career RMX). I've finally gotten another automata to work using the same principle: Brian's Brain.<br />
      <br />
      Brian's Brain is an extremely chaotic automata that has 3 basic rules:<br />
      -Any dead cell with 2 neighbors is born<br />
      -All living cells grow "old"<br />
      -Any old cell dies<br />
      <br />
      Due to the extremely chaotic nature of this rule, I don't think it's quite as "pretty" as Conway's Life or Career...so I'm posting it here for commentary - so TFF3.0 doesn't end up like the last one... :hang:<br />
      <br />

      <p class="post-content">Cool<br />
      There will be so many of those ee... things (maybe 2 many) and then they'll "die" and then...etc.<br />
      I like the point of this preset, cool!</p>

      <p class="post-content">This creates a bit too many live cells. I like how it looks kinda 3-D because of the fadeout. A bit too chaotic for my tastes, but alright</p>

      <p class="post-content">First of all, the cells don't move, the patterns they make do. An individual cell will live or die based on how many of it's neighbors are alive. If you still don't understand, google for some info on "Conway's Game of Life"<br />
      The cells dying off all at once is something I do to refresh the screen - imho the various spaceships (patterns that move regularly in a straight line) crashing into each other is much more interesting than the raw chaos.<br />
      <br />
      Anubis: Right now I'm working on two other Life rules: Star Wars and Sticks. I picked the Brian's Brain rule because it is extremely simple and doesn't involve very many states (only 3). Look up Mirek's Cellebration (thanx Nic!) if you want to know more :)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yesh! Got it working right ;)<br />
      This one has beat response and color, but it doesn't work quite like Brian's Brain because of the coloring. See the comment for more info.</p>

      <p class="post-content">:eek: Very... unique preset, it reminds me those very old games :rolleyes:<br />
      I just stared at this preset for a wile, its like small world those pieces are kinda random thoughts trying to make their way out, craching with one and other, destroying each-other, respawning(spelling???) etc.<br />
      Positively very good preset, keep up the good work...<br />

      You cant make anything *really* chaotic whith avs becouse of the limited resolution and color choice.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Minus, don't put that in an unrelated thread. Start a new one if there aren't any relevant ones already. Here, I added some color morphing. I would reccommend stopping the parabolas at the points of the star.</p>

      Shock Value: It's not really "thinking outside the box", it's just a hack, and not even a real hack, at that. All I needed was a way to calculate how many alive neighbors a cell had. Up 'till CFP made the Convolution Filter APE I couldn't do that without an APE of my own. In fact, if I wanted to, I could probably make another APE that was specifically directed at doing an average 3x3 blur that would be a little bit faster, but since I don't know assembly and I don't do APEs in general, I can't ;) (That and I'm lazy as fuck)</p>
