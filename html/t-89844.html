      I guess most of you already knew this, but I just noticed that M.A.R. has been echo'ing the Staff comments for a while :). For example Pickin Dim II or the 3D Anaglyph presets... there are more, these are just 2 I just found.<br />
      <br />
      What is his problem? :) :D</p>

      <p class="post-content">God he is annoying isn't he!!!<br />
      <br />
      He has ventured from AVS presets to all WA vis plug-in it seems see Mocha <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/componentId=101321" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/plugins/componentId=101321</a><br />
      <br />
      What a pain. The worst thing is that the staff do not have a clue most of the time what they are on about.<br />
      <br />
      OK there are obvious plug-ins/packs that deserve 5 but the WA staff just give 4-5 stars for 2 stars things.<br />
      <br />
      It it just stupid.<br />
      <br />
      I need to get my arse in gear and try and get a forum reviewers community sorted out like the skin bods do.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Mmmm mocha... now that brings back memories :). I made quite a few Benes for it. (the correct URL is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=101321" target="_blank">http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail...onentId=101321</a> by the way ;))<br />
      <br />
      It has really cool features, it's just a bit outdated now. If Wes Cherry were to implement a newer version as an APE, it would expand AVS' possiblities massively. Direct pixel access is the one thing that's missing really.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Anyway back to the topic... I just don't understand what M.A.R. wants to achieve. Posting downrating and negative comments at least has a meaning (though a lame one), but I've never seen someone echo staff reviews before.<br />
      <br />
      The only thing I mind about the AVS reviews is that they are pretty much useless: even the crappiest AVS packs get 2-3 stars. Usually in those cases the only reason it looks good is because AVS is so powerful, not because they spent time creating cool presets. Heck, it's hard to make ugly stuff with it :). I don't want to discourage newbies from joining the community, but having a huge library of homogenous presets doesn't have any purpose. It just makes it more likely for cool presets to get lost in the masses. Not to mention the fact that it encourages others to send in presets of the same level, which causes a snowball effect.<br />
      Where's that thread we had earlier about it? Almost half of the AVS reviews contain the words "solid visuals" in them by the way :).</p>

      <p class="post-content">The reviewers thread..it is there somewhere and I have forgotten about it infact I have heard the a new winamp.com should be about in the couple of months probably looking a little like on winamp.deskmod.com<br />
      There is an AVS bit there too.<br />
      <br />
      I will find more out later, after the weekend, and keep you folks posted to find if it is possibale to have some AVS reveiwers. I do not see why not.</p>
