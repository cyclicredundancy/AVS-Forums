Your eyes can percieve refresh rates well above 60Hz depending on the intensite of the light, part of your vision you are seeing it from etc...<br><br>In the context of AVS a faster refresh rate on your monitor would indeed make fps's above 60 worthwhile and (probably more importantly) reduces the chance of the screen redrawing while the current frame is being swapped out (tearing)[unless you have wait for retrace/page flipping enabled]. I would agree that the worthwhileness (technical term) falls off pretty steeply past 60Hz :P</div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">jheriko</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">14th September 2006 09:52 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">If the refresh rate is low enough (usually 60 or anything below) you can see tearing on the screen <b>with</b> wait for retrace or page flipping, especially in the peripheral vision. On CRTs it is especially obvious, it appears as a sort of flicking which seems to scroll down the screen. On LCD the effect is lessened somewhat, I think it is because the colour from each pixel fades less quickly so the flashing is less severe.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
