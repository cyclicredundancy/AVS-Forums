I've been working to put up a site with Winamp AVS tutorials as an independent study for my high school. The intent of this site (at least for now) is to provide the <i>basics</i> of the Winamp AVS (with an emphasis on the math of the Superscope, currently). I hope to make this site a good starting point for those interested in the AVS, but without any idea how to go about making presets (a good grasp on high school level math is also recommended). It's currently online at <a href="http://www.xoasis.com/~soulcatalyst/" target="_blank">http://www.xoasis.com/~soulcatalyst/</a> .<br><br>So, for those interested in the basics, please check out the site. And for those who know more than that (especially those who know more than me), please check out the site, and recommend changes or additions that you would like to see. Thanks.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">dirkdeftly</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">21st May 2002 18:58 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content">There's mine, and UnConeD's (in the AVS forum), but I don't think I want mine being distributed off of Winamp.com yet.

My primary theme is just different uses of objects, like superscopes, so that the person reading it gets a more comprehensive understanding of how to use the different objects.

I remember me experimenting with the SSC and getting nothing but mess.<br><br>To draw a line with the SSC:<br>In the Point field of the SSC write: x=i. Isn't that a pretty line? Well, it all starts from here...<br><br>What you need is to:<br>1) Search the forums. There is plenty of stuff on this topic there.<br>2) Read the FAQ.<br>3) Get loaded with tutorials (try searching for "AVS Primer" and other in the forums)<br>4) Go to sites like mine (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/avsdiscussion" target="_blank">AVS Discussion</a>) or soulcatalyst's (<a href="http://soulcatalyst.***********/main.html" target="_blank">http://soulcatalyst.***********/main.html</a>)<br>5) Experiment a lot (you'll get the hang of it eventually)</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">cmountford</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">30th July 2002 18:10 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>here's something</strong><br>I just realized I need a little more of a transition from Algebra I graphing to get to where this part of my guide starts. I'll work on getting basic line graphing a little later, but I hope the Microsoft Word document is a help for now. It's really the same principle in my current guide...it just changes the line (simple equation such as y=.5x+2) based on the sound input</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">soulcatalyst</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">5th August 2002 00:36 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>The Latest</strong><br>I've finally gone back and started working on SoulCatalyst's Domain again.

When AVS applies the movement, it looks up the source pixels for every target pixel and copies the colour from source to target.<br><br>So when you specify d=d*2, you're saying that pixels halfway to the edge (d=0.5) should get the colour that is at the edge (d=0.5*2=1). This means that the image will be zoomed *out*: the area (-1...1) gets squised into (-0.5...0.5).<br><br>Now if this makes sense, you'll understand why atan(d) makes a tunnel movement. Open this in a new window:<br><a href="http://acko.net/dump/datand.png" target="_blank">http://acko.net/dump/datand.png</a><br><br>The red line is the plot of f(x)=x, a 45° angled line. This is 'no movement', every point gets projected onto itself.<br><br>The blue curve is an approximation of the plot of f(x)=atan(x). I exaggerated the curving to make it easier to illustrate.<br><br>We take a point at a certain distance (the leftmost fat ellipse on the bottom axis) and we're going to apply the movement d=atan(d). We trace its location on the graph upwards (gray line). We need to draw a horizontal line and intersect with the blue curve. This is where this point would end up after one step of movement. Again, this is not how AVS works, but this is how it works intuitively.<br><br>We trace down again and find the target distance as the second point from the left on the axis. You can see the point moved ******ds.<br><br>Now we keep applying this: trace up, trace horizontal, intersect with blue, trace down to find out where it will end after several frames (and repeated movement). You can see that because the distance between the red line and the blue line increases, the point will move ******ds faster and faster.<br><br>What we're doing is actually a kind of source map now. AVS looks at the graph 90° rotated. You can understand that, if the blue curve doesn't cover the entire vertical range, that some points on the red line might not have a target horizontally of them. This is why a source-map can leave holes in the image.<br><br>Now what this example doesn't show is that there can be a huge difference is resulting movement from two slightly different curves, because the shape of the movement is the result of repeatedly following the points, rather than just once.</p></div><hr><div class="footer"><p class="text-muted small">Fork me on <a href="https://github.com/visbot/AVS-Forums/">GitHub</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.cookie.min.js" defer></script><script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scripts.js" defer></script></body></html>
