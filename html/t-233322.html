      Im curious, what's going on here? Why is the 5 last avs submissions all rated 3 stars and reviewed with only one word? What the heck is up with that?<br />

      Just what is going on around here? Did the site got hacked, did the reviewers got fired? Or is winamp turning against it's own product now?</p>

      <p class="post-content">^you're grandchild I suppose?<br />
      but this is psychotic indeed...<br />
      <br />
      Let's review these reviews:<br />
      These reviews are obviously your first attempts at reviewing.<br />
      I suggest you read some tutorials about this and come back later.<br />
      Also, don't post your opinion in words, but collect them into so-called 'sentences'.<br />
      Do not forget the actual 'Rating' itself too. Simply selecting three stars for everything won't do, especially for reincarnation.<br />
      <br />
      Try writing some testreviews in notepad for yourself, just to give yourself some practice.<br />
      <br />
      But until then, don't bother even touching the winamp plugin submitting area.<br />
      <br />
      Final score: :( :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad:</p>

      <br />
      I don't care so much about the rating, rather the review. I'm glad that they finally got around to publishing my pack, but "Good job."? A review is supposed to be a critical evaluation, be it good or bad.<br />
      <br />
      I'm trying to improve as an artist, and the creators of my so called weapon-of-choice have certainly let me down with their absence of criticism. If this is what I have to look forward to, I'll just stick with posting links to deviantart in the future. :hang:</p>

      <p class="post-content">Ok.... I was away for a couple of weeks (extremely busy with my college + trip to Slovenia), and I apologize for the wait.<br />
      <br />
      However, I WASN'T the one who did that. I mean, damn, you (probably) know me. I am ALWAYS eloquent in my ratings, and they're more or less fair. A couple of days ago I visited the site to see if they're still there, and they were (only had 15 minutes to myself). Today, I finally managed to scrounge up the time to review stuff. And there weren't ANY packs in the queue. I went to the plugins section, read the reviews, and suddenly had an urge to rip someone's head off.<br />
      <br />
      I'm sorry dsfs, I really am... I'll edit all of those with proper numbers and reviews, but due to the crapiness of the site, the 3 will stick while browsing.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Well i don't specificly state in my comments that you must ask me personally (the trusting fool that i am) and he did give me credit for the preset.<br />
      <br />
      So <b>technically</b> it's not a rip and i don't think winamp will apply a policy that would "not allow really bad remixes, because they don't add much to the original", or does it?<br />
      <br />
      In short: I really don't like the preset, but he did give me credit. Now the question is do you think it shouldn't be in the site simply because it sucks?<br />
      <br />
      [edit]Im not the one to dictate the rules and policies of winamp, so i say let it stay, because it doesn't break the rules of the site.<br />
      <br />
      But on the day when a policy that simply doesn't allow bad submissions will step in order, note me and i'll start gathering a list of all the shitty 1 preset n00b submissions :p</p>

        Sounds a bit of a conspiracy to me, you know mojomaster/axe paid AOL/nullsoft to publish the plugin fast and feature it... and us little folk get walked over while the big boys play :igor:<br />

        I agree with wally's idea, but I would like to hear some opinions on this:<br />

        I have to report that sometime around yesterday, some of the 3 star rated avs submissions disappeared into oblivion, but now when i look at the most recently submited avs's they are all in place!<br />
        <br />
        Is it just me and my browser's cache playing tricks on me, or what the heck is going on around here?!<br />

        Good things are coming, including a new way to publish AVS presets, you'll have to take my word for that.<br />
        <br />
        Why don't you guys make a thread here telling him what you would like to see for AVS presets. The only thing I know so far is he wants to split them from the other plugins.<br />
        <br />
        We would have skins, plugins and presets.</p>

Anyway, thank you very much for the edit as well as the nice review. I owe you one for this. :)
