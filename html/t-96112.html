      <p class="post-content"><strong>Bump/dim light</strong><br />
      Which numbers would I use to dim the light in trans/bump? And can I write in something to make light have like a colored lens on it (ability to pick color from color chart)? What would I write and where??<br />
      <br />
      THANKS<br />

      <blockquote>
        Which numbers would I use to dim the light in trans/bump
      </blockquote>The numbers &amp; variables I believe you were referring to actually control the movement of the bump--not the brightness. ***EDIT: I just realized you can use bi to reduce the bump intensity. You would write it in Init (example: bi=.2). You could also have the bump intensity change on every beat if you also write a value for bi in On Beat. Another way***&lt;---(end of edit) to tone down the brightness is to use the Trans-Brightness to filter out just the bump (you'd need to use some other stuff...possibly buffer saves/effect lists...if you didn't want to dim the rest of your presets). An easier way to do this is to simply reduce the bumpiness (move the slider closer to Flat). Another thing that helps it blend in with your preset better is to select the Blend 50/50 option. You might also experiment with the different options in an Effect list. (be sure the bump is *inside* the Effect list).<br />
      <br />
      In response to your 2nd &amp; 3rd questions, there isn't currently a way to change the color of the bump. Search the AVS Wishlist sub-forum, and if somebody hasn't already suggested this, write your suggestion there.<br />
      <br />
      :) Hope that helps :)

      <p class="post-content">Actually, it's possible to color a bump. The technique I know of is by Degnic in his Tribute to AVS-King preset (in Desible.2).<br />
      First, have 2 bumps - All set to 1st buffer.<br />
      Now have an effect list. Make a fullscreen SSC (Or half, then mirrored - Degnic's way) (Or make a dot SSC located in middle, then use the movement d=0) in a Effect list, make sure the color randomizes every beat, then set to Subtractive Blend 1. Double the list, then set the 2nd one to Buffer Blend - Buffer 1. Oh yeah, you also need a decent background. I think the bump loses its bumping power though... Oh yeah, and add a buffer save - Save to Buffer in the list that contains the BG, and set BG list output to Ignore.<br />
      <br />
      Oh, and experimenting with depth buffer of Bump might yield interesting results ;)</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thank you for the correction, Nic01. I had not heard thought of doing that! Guess there's probably ways to get a desired effect without having to wait for the next version of AVS to get the feature from a suggestion you made to the wishlist.<br />
      <br />
      But for those of us who don't think to do stuff like that, it still might be an idea for the wishlist to be able to pick the color from an option in the bump.</p>
