Yeah, I saw them then, but never got around to posting a reply.<br><br>First off, you'd probably get a better responce to your posts if you command people to download your presets. You probably won't get as many responces as normal now 'cause most people are smack-dab in the middle of finals. Ontop of that, there are our real lives. Some people have better things to do. Not me (righ now anyway, but employment starts soon), but some people do.<br><br>Anyway, to your presets.<br><br>My favourite was alien. UnconeD's tentacle APE is cool on it's own, but that DDM just made it look cooler (despite being the default one). :)<br><br>Overall, work is needed. Rainstorm was kinda nice, but most of your presets are kind of static. Presets are about things reacting to the music, and a plin old osciliscope (?sp) star and regular movement aint gonna cut it. You can do some truly nifty stuff with stock movements and roto-blitters and stuff, but that's just the beginning. I see you tried your hand at making your own movemets in lazer shower, but you didn't catch one thing...<br><br>y=52*18 will set the y value for every pixel to 926. Usually what's done with a movement and DMs is relational movement. Something like y=y+.02;. That will shift all the y values up by .02 each frame. Turn on wrap and it'll look like the v-synch is slightly off on an old TV. The point is that you're making y equal to itself plus something. That means that the new value for y depends on the old value for y.<br>It's how any sort of movement or distortion is done.<br><br>Keep it up. Keep learning. Remember, variety is the spice of life.</p></div><hr><div class="post"><p class="post-meta"><span class="post-author text-primary">Matt_W74656</span><br></p><p class="post-time small text-muted">6th June 2002 13:19 <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></p><p class="post-content"><strong>Thanks...</strong><br>Thanks for your reply I was really getting desprate. As for the "Math" yes ,allthough you probaly all ready figured it out, I did't know what I was doing. I was just typing number y= such and such tell some even slightly neat happaned. THey should get better this was my first time I used math in my presets. I also have now learned programming is in them to. My ;ast 3 I posted allso is the same with the lazers except I adding a blender and all of a sudden evreything cleared up and looked better. My last 3 also move to the beat and with evrey song a diffrent patern will accure. Thanks for you saying on alien, the best thing i had before was from my parents and that was "Wierd" so I feel much better now it was for nothing. I'll fix some of them up and add some other thingss.
