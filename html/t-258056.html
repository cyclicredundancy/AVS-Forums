      <p class="post-content">What we have here is a 4.75 pack. :)<br />
      <br />
      I absolutely love Gyro (Montana's remix as well) and Proxy (Yathosho's remix too). Some of the others are very good as well. It feels just a touch too repetitive, but it's a great pack nonetheless.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Yay my remix made it in the pack :D<br />
      Woo, the rest of the pack is really cool too, kudos Mr Nudge!<br />
      My favorite is proxy.<br />
      [Although, I did prefer the previous version of gyro.]</p>

      <p class="post-content">cheers J. a lot of people seem to like proxy.. and apparently it's easy to remix. i made a new version for the forums compilaton so it should be interesting what people think of that. by the way, what did you think of how wireframe finally turned out?</p>

      <p class="post-content">its an interesting preset, but the mouse control doesn't really add much for me. all the points start to converge once the mouse is on the screen which is a bit annoying :/</p>

      <p class="post-content">I thought this pack was very well done overall, I forgot to mention it anywhere.<br />
      <br />
      Its generally a higher standard of preset than I am used to from you, good colours, structure, and some quality remixes. I will try to put a decent review on devart, but for the mean time.. good job :)</p>
