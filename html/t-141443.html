      <p class="post-content">Well you can down load it if you don't have it. Just check in the AVS Config to see if it is there. It will be under the "Trans" menu.</p>

      <p class="post-content">This seems like old news and all but I have to submit my latest update on my AVS preset, Mysterious Beat Beauty. It was the original one, not the re-mix. I will put a downloadable zip here and let you all see it for yourself. Rate it if you want to. The rating scale will be 0 to a 5, 0 being terrible and 5 being astounding. Please comment upon it even though it is old news and should stay in the past.</p>

      <p class="post-content">Thanks man. Well I added a few touches to it though. The newest update was moving some things around. Simple things. It will never be completed though. :D I will continue to update it. I will post the newest update of the AVS tomorrow. For now I will just look at it and see any other problems that I can find and fix them or maybe add some things to it.</p>

      <p class="post-content">My update. I wanted to edit the previous one but I can't since the time for modifiying the message expired already. Well here is the update and sorry for this sentence to be semi-big. Well I hope the newest update looks good though.</p>

      <p class="post-content">.. Well I am sorry, I don't like the invert effect for mine, looks too crappy. I will try something else though. Oh yeah Ishan, I just don't want to use the same layout for mine on the remix. I will still use it though since you did modify mine which was mine in the first place. As usual you get credit for the remix though. It is wrong to take full credit for it. I will see what I can do with mine to make it less dark. Just be patient and keep coming back for more updates or whatnot.</p>
